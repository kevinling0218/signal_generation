    Ireland is likely to be the fasting growing economy in Europe this year for the fifth year in a row, but the recovery has been uneven for some consumers, with only modest gains in purchasing power.
    The KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index slipped to 96.4 in September from 102.4 in August and 107.6 in July. The second consecutive decline ends a see-saw pattern of monthly changes since the index hit a 17-year high in January.
    The survey's authors said in a statement that the fall represents a clear drop in confidence among Irish consumers and reflects a significant downgrade in views on household finances and the broader economic outlook.
    ""There is little doubt that the increasingly loud and jarring ticking of the Brexit clock has unnerved Irish consumers,"" KBC Ireland Chief Economist Austin Hughes said.
    ""The threat posed by a possible 'hard Brexit' is notably amplified by high profile cost increases in areas such as light, heating and housing while many consumers may feel their personal circumstances are very remote from recent reports of a return to the boom.""
    For the first time since December 2016, a larger share of consumers (23 percent) felt their financial circumstances had worsened over the previous year, than felt they had improved (21 percent),the survey found.

    Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index fell to 52.5 in September from 53.5 in August, unchanged from a preliminary reading. 
    The result brought the indicator closer to the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
    Survey panellists reported the lowest factory output in two years as export orders fell slightly last month,  while input costs grew much fast than selling prices.
    ""Global trade frictions and stretched supply chain capacity were the main headwinds faced by goods producers, which contributed to an unhealthy mix of falling export sales and rising input prices,"" IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore said.
    He said that the automotive sector in particular reported weak business conditions, but said that in a positive note overall firms stepped up hiring.
    ""Job creation edged up slightly since August, which manufacturers linked to long-term capacity upgrades and ongoing business investment plans at their plants,"" he said.
    Business investment has been one of the main engines of growth in the French economy this year, helping to underpin employment gains in the face of weak household consumption.

strike for higher wages on Monday, less then three weeks after a
new minority centre-left government led by Prime Minister Marjan
Sarec took power following a June parliamentary election.
    The police, who are demanding an average wage increase of
about 15 percent, began their strike in February but suspended
it in March when the previous prime minister resigned, prompting
an early election. [nL8N1Q22L3]
    They sent their demands to the new government a few days
after it was formed but have so far received no reply, Radivoj
Urosevic, the head of the Police Trade Union, told Reuters.
[nL5N1VZ68R]
    ""The position of the police is bad, which is why the number
of policemen in the country is shrinking,"" Urosevic said, adding
that the police would continue to perform all duties necessary
to ensure security in the country.
    By midday on Monday no incidents caused by the police strike
had been reported.
    A number of other trade unions are also demanding higher
wages, including teachers and nurses, and the government last
Thursday formed a team to conduct negotiations with the public
sector trade unions.
    The previous government said earlier this year that all the
trade union wage demands amounted to about one billion euros,
adding that the budget could not cover such wage hikes.
    Slovenia hopes to end 2018 with a budget surplus of about
0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) versus a surplus of
0.03 percent last year.
    ""The government is taking the demands of the police trade
unions and other trade unions very seriously,"" the Ministry of
Public Administration said in a statement on Friday.
    ""The agreement between the government and trade unions is an
absolute priority for the governnment so we are aiming for talks
to begin as soon as possible,"" it added.

 (Updates with details, background)
    HAMBURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> believes a
hardware retrofit of older diesel cars is not feasible in the
near term, a source at the carmaker said on Monday, ahead of a
German coalition committee meeting on the matter. 
    The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
suppliers were unwilling to assume liability, and that car
manufacturers also rejected guarantees for hardware changes. 
    The positioning comes as the German government and carmakers
try to agree on a deal to avert court bans on older diesel
vehicles from city streets to improve air quality.
    Leaders and senior members of the parties in Chancellor
Angela Merkel's ruling coalition of conservatives and
centre-left Social Democrats meet later on Monday to discuss the
issue.
    A spokesman for Volkswagen said that the company was
prepared to compromise. 
    ""Basically, we're interested in meaningful solutions that
help prevent bans in cities,"" said the spokesman. ""We'll
consider the contribution we can make in due course.""
    Merkel's government has been split on how best to tackle the
problem. Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer has sided with
carmakers in calling for incentives to encourage owners of older
models to trade them in for newer, cleaner ones.
    Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has, meanwhile, called
for hardware retrofits on older models - an option that the
industry says is only feasible in some cases but which would hit
fuel consumption and performance in others. [nL8N1WE2TH]

    BUDAPEST, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Growth in Czech and Polish
manufacturing slowed to almost two-year lows in September and
Hungarian data also showed a slowdown on Monday, signalling that
Central Europe's fast-growing economies are facing bleaker
prospects.
    The region, which has close economic and export links to the
eurozone, primarily to Germany, has been booming in the past
years helped by loose monetary policies. The Hungarian and
Polish central banks still maintain a dovish stance.
    But growth of Germany's manufacturing sector slowed to a
25-month low in September on the steepest drop in new export
orders in more than five years, which does not bode well for the
eastern economies of the European Union. 
    As rising uncertainties amid an escalating trade war between
the United States and China are taking their toll on the German
economy, the latest readings of Purchasing Managers' indices on
Monday showed the Czech PMI reading at its lowest since November
2016 and order growth also at a nearly 2-year low.
    Activity in Polish manufacturing barely grew in September as
new orders fell for the first time in nearly two years.
    The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index for Polish
manufacturing fell to 50.5 in September from 51.4 in August, its
lowest level since October, 2016. It came in below a forecast
for 51.5 in a Reuters poll.
    Hungary's seasonally-adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index
dropped to 53.8 in September from a revised 56 in August.
    The Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory
Management said the figure was below an average reading of 57.1
in the past three Septembers.
    ""The PMIs for Central Europe fell markedly in September.
Most notably, the Polish and Czech surveys plunged to their
weakest levels since late-2016,"" Capital Economics said in a
note.
    ""Manufacturing output has weakened in Germany, and this is
starting to feed through to softer industrial activity in
Central Europe. This supports our forecast that growth across
the region will continue to slow over the coming quarters.""    
    Germany's leading economic institutes last week cut their
2018 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 1.7 percent
from 2.2 percent.
    Hungary's economy, home to big car manufacturing plants of
Daimler and Audi, is expected to slow to 3.5 percent next year
and 3 percent in 2020, from 4.4 percent this year according to
central bank data.
    The Polish economy is projected to slow as well, to 3.8
percent next year from 4.6 percent this year based on central
bank data.
    The Czech economy is expected to grow at a rate of 3.2
percent this year and 3.4 percent next year, according to its
central bank.

Seehofer said on Monday some refugees should be allowed to shed
their asylum seeker status if they find a job and learn German,
signalling his readiness to compromise in a coalition dispute
about a new immigration law.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to help companies struggling
with massive labour shortages by lowering the hurdles for
skilled workers from outside the European Union. [nL5N1VY57I]
    But the planned immigration law, due to be discussed at
high-level coalition talks on Monday, risks angering those
voters who feel neglected after Merkel's 2015 decision to admit
more than a million refugees and migrants, mostly Muslims from
the Middle East.
    While a growing number of the refugees are finding jobs, the
process is slow given the urgency of the need for skilled
workers. It takes up to five years for a low-educated Syrian or
Iraqi to learn German and get a professional qualification.
    The coalition parties disagree over whether refugees who are
already living in Germany should be allowed to shed their asylum
status if they have found a job and learned German.
    Seehofer, head of Merkel's more conservative Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), said he had worked out
a compromise deal with Labour Minister Hubertus Heil from the
centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) ahead of Monday's talks.
    Seehofer insisted that asylum seekers whose request had been
rejected would have to leave Germany, regardless of whether they
had found a job and learned German in the meantime.
    However, there should be an exemption for those asylum
seekers who cannot be deported because they would face a threat
such as torture in their home country, Seehofer said.
    ""People say: Before they sit around, let them work,"" said
Seehofer, whose CSU fears losing voters to the far-right in a
regional election later this month.
    Employers' associations and the centre-left SPD want the new
immigration law to include the possibility for refugees to shed
their asylum status once they have found work and learned
German.
    ""It's about preventing a situation where we send back the
right people - and then have to painstakingly search for skilled
workers abroad,"" Heil told Reuters in an interview last month.
    Seehofer had previously opposed the 'Spurwechsel' (lane
change) proposal because he feared it would encourage
immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills.

    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Cooperation agreements for
supervising cross-border asset managers will be in place before
Britain leaves the European Union next March, France's top
markets regulator said on Monday.
    Asset managers are worried that if Britain crashes out of
the EU next March with no transition deal, they would no longer
be able to manage funds listed in the EU under a regime known as
delegation.
    London-based asset managers operate funds listed in
Luxembourg and Dublin holding over a trillion euros of assets
for customers across the bloc.
    Robert Ophele, chairman of France's markets watchdog AMF,
said delegation could only be possible if memoranda of
understanding (MOUs) have been signed between UK and EU
regulators to cooperate in supervision.
    ""This type of MOU is very easy to write. We have them with
many many countries and they all look the same,"" Ophele told a
conference in London organised by financial sector body AFME.
    ""It's my absolute conviction that we will have that in 
force before the Brexit, whatever the Brexit will be,"" Ophele
said. ""It's not a big deal.""
    Industry officials say regulators would likely announce the
MOUs in November or later, once political talks on Britain's EU
divorce settlement, which includes a transition period, have
been concluded.
    France is seen by UK fund managers as trying to curb
delegation in order to put pressure on them to shift senior
managers in Britain to new EU hubs.
    The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
has issued guidelines on how far delegation can go, saying that
the new EU hubs must have ""substance"" or sufficient number of
senior investment staff.
    Ophele said Paris-based ESMA's powers should be bolstered to
avoid national regulators across the EU diverging from centrally
agreed financial rules for asset managers and other sectors.
    National regulators should be forced to say publicly if they
comply with all of ESMA's financial sector guidance, he said.
    Asked if ESMA should become a ""super"" regulator with much
stronger powers like the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Ophele replied, ""In some cases yes, in other cases
not. But it will not happen very rapidly.""

    * VW among brands seen pricing aggressively
    * Concerns mount over profitability

    By Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive
en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car
launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.
  
    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
    Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this
week, from PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> electric DS3 Crossback to the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> EQC, will erode profitability as they
struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
    But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as
consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing
carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
    ""What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is
like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares,
chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
    A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW <BMWG.DE>, blamed in part
on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a
first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
    ""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put
the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
    Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime
Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding
a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as
the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to
cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by
2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal
many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of
fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    
    PRICED TO PUSH
    After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions
are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from
diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides
and particulates, but less CO2. [nL8N1QK23C]
    Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and
faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled
emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises
more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has said the ID hatchback, due to
open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced
close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
    ""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the
same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent
Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
    ""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been
factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay
penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the
market going.""
    Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want
our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably
equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
    Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them
have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification
investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
    They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more
electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by
California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches
are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
        
    COST GAP
    Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on
average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in
hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a
combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
    When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
    Mass-market electrics such as the Renault <RENA.PA> Zoe and
Nissan <7201.T> Leaf have been on sale for most of the current
decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla <TSLA.O>
has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric
cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
    Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already
priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker
acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
    Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close
to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
[nL8N1VQ0ZG]
    ""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the
industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley
Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify
investment at all - it's all regulation.""
    Which is why, on this subject more than most, European
carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives
exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their
Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the
region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
    ""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't
met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA
Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
    
    SCALE EFFECTS
    Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in
recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
    Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But
lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric
car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will
pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
    Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies
are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives
have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. [nL8N1WD2U9]
    Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK
market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition
to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
    French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to
match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat
told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the
carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
    ""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,""
Salvat said.
    German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which
includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on
electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their
biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
    That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and
Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric
cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
    ""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW
research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
    ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

its 2019 draft budget to parliament on Monday evening, aiming to
outperform its primary surplus targets for a fifth year and
avoid implementing painful pension cuts agreed with creditors.
    Greece emerged from an international bailout in August.
    The government has promised its international lenders it
will achieve a primary budget surplus, excluding debt servicing
outlays, of least 3.5 percent of economic output up to 2022. 
    Hinging on its fiscal outpeformance, Athens hopes its euro
zone lenders will allow it to skip pension cuts scheduled to
kick in next year, when the left-right coalition government's
term expires.
    In its first post-bailout budget, Athens is also expected to
project economic growth of about 2.5 percent next year, Prime
Minister Alexis Tsipras said last week. The economy is seen
growing by 2.1 percent this year.  
    ""Today's fiscal environment and the Greek government's
intention to proceed with fiscal interventions which will
prevent cutting pensions will be reflected in the draft budget,""
government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters.
    Tzanakopoulos said talks with the EU Commission on freezing
pension cuts were progressing ""on good terms"". 
    Solving this issue amicably is crucial as the country is
closely monitored by markets and any sign of fiscal deviation
may plunge it back into crisis.   
    ""Some common ground will be found with the Commission, since
it is self-evident that the 3.5 percent primary surplus can be
achieved without implementing the fiscal measure of pension
cuts,"" he said.
    In the meantime, the government is likely to submit a draft
budget which will include fiscal scenarios rather than clarity 
on whether it will implement the cuts. 
    Greece has also promised to hand out a social dividend to
those hit hardest during the debt crisis which broke out in
2010. But the exact amount to be spent will be decided after
deliberations with the EU Commission, Tzanakopoulos said.
    Last month, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras used a keynote
policy speech in the northern city of Thessaloniki to announce a
spending spree that he said would help fix the ills of years of
belt-tightening and boost growth.[L5N1VU0ON]
    Greece will submit its final 2019 budget in mid-November.

 (Adds Valeo CEO comment)
    By Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive
en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car
launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.
  
    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
    Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this
week, from PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> electric DS3 Crossback to the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> EQC, will erode profitability as they
struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
    But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as
consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing
carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
    ""What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is
like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares,
chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
    A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW <BMWG.DE>, blamed in part
on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a
first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
    ""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put
the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
    Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime
Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding
a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as
the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to
cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by
2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal
many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of
fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    
    PRICED TO PUSH
    After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions
are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from
diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides
and particulates, but less CO2. [nL8N1QK23C]
    Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and
faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled
emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises
more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has said the ID hatchback, due to
open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced
close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
    ""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the
same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent
Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
    ""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been
factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay
penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the
market going.""
    Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want
our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably
equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
    Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them
have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification
investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
    They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more
electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by
California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches
are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
        
    COST GAP
    Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on
average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in
hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a
combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
    When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
    Mass-market electrics such as the Renault <RENA.PA> Zoe and
Nissan <7201.T> Leaf have been on sale for most of the current
decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla <TSLA.O>
has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric
cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
    Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already
priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker
acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
    Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close
to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
[nL8N1VQ0ZG]
    ""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the
industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley
Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify
investment at all - it's all regulation.""
    Which is why, on this subject more than most, European
carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives
exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their
Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the
region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
    ""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't
met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA
Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
    Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.
    ""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich,
chief executive of Valeo <VLOF.PA>, a major manufacturer of
electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot
even though the market doesn't exist.""
        
    SCALE EFFECTS
    Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in
recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
    Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But
lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric
car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will
pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
    Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies
are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives
have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. [nL8N1WD2U9]
    Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK
market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition
to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
    French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to
match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat
told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the
carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
    ""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,""
Salvat said.
    German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which
includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on
electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their
biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
    That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and
Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric
cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
    ""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW
research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
    ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

deficit of 19.8 billion euros in September, rising by 3.8
billion euros compared with the same month last year, the
Treasury said on Monday.
    In the first nine months of this year, the cumulative budget
deficit amounted to 49.4 billion euros, some 7.8 billion euros
less than in the same period of 2017, the Treasury said.
    The state sector borrowing requirement (SSBR), a measure of
the gap between central government spending and income, differs
from the broader ""general government"" accounts, which the
European Union Stability and Growth Pact refers to when
assessing countries' deficit performances.
    Italy aims to cut its general government deficit this year
to 1.6 percent of gross domestic product from 2.4 percent last
year, well inside the European Union's 3 percent ceiling.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Brexit minister
Dominic Raab said on Monday Britain was looking at how
regulatory checks on some goods could be used as part of a
solution to move Brexit talks, notably a ""backstop deal"" for the
Irish border, forward.
    But he repeated that any such deal to prevent the return of
a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland
and EU member Ireland could not split the United Kingdom and
would have to be time-limited.
    Raab described a media report that had said the government
was preparing to back down on customs checks between mainland
Britain and Northern Ireland as ""overspeculating"". [nL4N1WH3OH]
    London has indicated that it may consider options on 
regulations on the island of Ireland, noting that there are
already some different rules for agriculture and food products
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
    But it was not clear whether the government would tolerate
such a difference for manufactured goods.
    Raab told an event on the sidelines of the Conservative
Party conference in Birmingham: ""Our number one priority is
making sure we don't see a border down the Irish sea that will
carve up economically the United Kingdom,"" Raab said.
    ""We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs backstop
and on the regulatory side of things, we have been clear that we
will, as long as we can carry the communities of Northern
Ireland with us, we will be open to be looking at some of the
options on regulatory checks.""
    He also said he welcomed EU chief negotiator Michel
Barnier's suggestion that technology could help resolve the
border issue.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - British finance
minister Philip Hammond said on Monday  rebalancing trade with
the EU was a delicate process which should be done gradually,
and that product standards should stay the same after Brexit.
    ""We have to be very, very careful and we need a very, very

    However, he was ""much, much more sceptical"" about adopting
EU standards on financial services.
    ""This is a fast-developing area that could move in a

    By Lefteris Papadimas and George Georgiopoulos
    ATHENS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Greece on Monday unveiled next
year's budget draft, aiming to attain a bigger primary surplus
than that agreed with its international creditors, projecting
that economic growth will pick up to 2.5 percent.
    In what will be the first budget with the country out of
bailout programmes, the government aims to outperform on primary
surplus targets for a fifth straight year to be in a position to
avoid implementing painful pension cuts agreed with creditors.
    Athens emerged from an international bailout in August.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pitched rescinding unpopular
pension cuts slated for January as part of relief measures,
claiming there is ample fiscal space to do so.
    The government, which has promised its euro zone lenders and
the International Monetary Fund it will achieve a 3.5 percent of
GDP primary budget surplus excluding debt servicing outlays, is
targeting a surplus of 4.14 percent next year. If it does not
apply the cuts it puts the figure at 3.56 percent.         
    Trailing the conservative opposition in polls, Tsipras is
counting on a less austere budget to gain voters next year, when
his term expires.
    The draft budget projects economic growth will pick up to 
2.5 percent from an expected 2.1 percent this year.  
    ""The tax burden relief and the lowering of social security
contributions would not be possible without the fiscal
performance of the last three years, the fruit of the sacrifices
of Greek citizens,"" the draft said.  
    Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters
earlier on Monday that talks with the EU Commission on freezing
pension cuts were progressing ""on good terms"". 
    Solving this issue amicably is crucial as the country is
closely monitored by markets and any sign of fiscal slippage may
plunge it back into crisis.   
    ""Some common ground will be found with the Commission, since
it is self-evident that the 3.5 percent primary surplus can be
achieved without implementing the fiscal measure of pension
cuts,"" the spokesman said.
    The budget plan projects public debt will fall to 170.2
percent of GDP next year from 183 percent in 2018.
    Tsipras has promised to hand out a social dividend to those
hit hardest during the debt crisis which broke out in 2010. The
exact amount to be spent will be decided after deliberations
with the EU Commission.
    Last month, Tsipras used a keynote policy speech to announce
measures that would help fix the ills of years of
belt-tightening. According to the draft budget these measures
total 1.1 billion euros.[L5N1VU0ON]
    Greece will submit its final 2019 budget in mid-November.

    * CO2 goals push electric-car prices lower
    * VW among brands seen pricing aggressively
    * Concerns mount over profitability

    By Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive
en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car
launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.
  
    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
    Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this
week, from PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> electric DS3 Crossback to the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> EQC, will erode profitability as they
struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
    But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as
consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing
carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
    ""What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is
like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares,
chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
    A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW <BMWG.DE>, blamed in part
on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a
first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
    ""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put
the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
    Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime
Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding
a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as
the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to
cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by
2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal
many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of
fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    
    PRICED TO PUSH
    After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions
are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from
diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides
and particulates, but less CO2. [nL8N1QK23C]
    Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and
faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled
emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises
more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has said the ID hatchback, due to
open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced
close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
    ""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the
same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent
Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
    ""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been
factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay
penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the
market going.""
    Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want
our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably
equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
    Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them
have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification
investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
    They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more
electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by
California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches
are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
        
    COST GAP
    Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on
average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in
hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a
combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
    When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
    Mass-market electrics such as the Renault <RENA.PA> Zoe and
Nissan <7201.T> Leaf have been on sale for most of the current
decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla <TSLA.O>
has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric
cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
    Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already
priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker
acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
    Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close
to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
[nL8N1VQ0ZG]
    ""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the
industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley
Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify
investment at all - it's all regulation.""
    Which is why, on this subject more than most, European
carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives
exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their
Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the
region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
    ""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't
met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA
Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
    Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.
    ""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich,
chief executive of Valeo <VLOF.PA>, a major manufacturer of
electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot
even though the market doesn't exist.""
        
    SCALE EFFECTS
    Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in
recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
    Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But
lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric
car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will
pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
    Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies
are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives
have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. [nL8N1WD2U9]
    Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK
market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition
to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
    French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to
match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat
told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the
carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
    ""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,""
Salvat said.
    German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which
includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on
electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their
biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
    That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and
Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric
cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
    ""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW
research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
    ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

    HELSINKI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - There is no room for lowering
capital requirements for euro zone banks but watchdogs should
avoid ""straight-jacketing"" bankers and stifling innovation, a
European Central Bank supervisor said on Tuesday.
    Pentti Hakkarainen, a member of the ECB's Single Supervisory
Board that oversees the euro zone's largest banks, batted back
industry complaints over how much cash and capital banks have
been asked to set aside in the aftermath of the financial
crisis.
    He cited a 2010 study that put the ideal level of Tier 1
capital at between 16 percent and 19 percent of risk-weighted
assets - higher than current levels in the euro zone.
    ""I do not see anything within recent research that leads me
to think this estimate was too high,"" Pentti Hakkarainen told an
audience in Helsinki.
    ""As both our minimum standards and global banks' current
capital ratios remain somewhat short of this level – I see no
room for relaxing capital requirements at this time,"" he added.
    The ECB has put pressure on banks to build up equity and
other capital since taking over as supervisor four years ago, in
a bid to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and the
ensuing taxpayer-funded bailouts.

on a new immigration law on Tuesday to attract more skilled
workers from countries outside the European Union, in a
politically risky push to fill a record number of job vacancies
and stabilise the public pension system.
    Centre-right Chancellor Angela Merkel, hardline Interior
Minister Horst Seehofer and Social Democrat Labour Minister
Hubertus Heil reached a compromise deal that removes labour
market hurdles for all non-EU citizens with job qualifications
and German language skills.
    The three coalition parties agreed in the outline of their
law, seen by Reuters, that companies will be allowed to recruit
foreign workers in all professions, regardless of an official
list of sectors suffering labour shortages.
    The paper also proposes that the government will no longer
insist that companies give preference to German citizens in
filling vacancies before looking for non-EU foreigners.
    In addition, foreign graduates and workers with vocational
training will get an opportunity to come to Germany for six
months to look for a position if they meet certain job
qualifications and German language requirements.
    They also have to prove that they have enough financial
resources so they will not depend on welfare benefits during
their stay in Germany, the parties agreed.
    The compromise deal does not include the so-called
'Spurwechsel' (lane change) proposal which would allow refugees
living in Germany to shed their asylum seeker status if they
find a job and learn German.
    Seehofer, whose CSU party fears losing voters to the
far-right in a regional election later this month, was against
such a provision because he feared it would encourage future
immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills.
    ""We maintain the principle of separation of asylum and
labour migration,"" the outline of the immigration law reads.
    But the parties said they would define a residence status
for well-integrated refugees who cannot be deported and are able
to earn their living on their own in order to give employers and
migrants more security when planning.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Boris Johnson,
Britain's former foreign minister, has told senior members of
the governing Conservative Party he would delay Brexit by at
least six months if he became prime minister, the Sun newspaper
said on Monday.
    The Sun reported that Johnson had been privately setting out
his leadership platform to some ministers in Prime Minister
Theresa May's government and said he wanted to use a pause to
reset the stalled Brexit negotiations.
    Reuters could not confirm the report, which Guy Verhofstad,
a leading EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit, referred to on
Tuesday, saying: ""A prolongation of Art. 50, as Boris Johnson
suggested, is a bad idea as it will prolong the uncertainty for
citizens & businesses.""
    The European Parliament, as well as the British one, must
sign off on any Brexit deal agreed between May and the other 27
EU national leaders. 
    Article 50 is the EU's mechanism for leaving the bloc and it
has a two-year limit. Britain formally triggered it in March
2017 and is due to leave the bloc next March. Any extension
would require unanimity of the remaining EU states.

European Central Bank said on Tuesday that the European Union
needed clearer rules to combat money laundering and that they
should apply equally in all EU states.
    ""A higher level of harmonisation of the applicable rules in
the form of a regulation should be considered"", Luis De Guindos
told EU finance ministers during a public debate in a meeting in
Luxembourg, which follows a string of high-profile cases of
money laundering at banks in the EU.
    An EU regulation is directly applicable in the 28 member
states, but EU rules against money laundering are currently
defined in directives which give governments broad leeway in
their application, which has resulted in different levels of
enforcement and gaps in the EU framework.

more-than-expected in August, driven higher by more costly
energy, according to data released on Tuesday.
    EU statistics agency Eurostat said prices at factory gates
in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent
month-on-month in August against market expectations of a 0.2
percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
    Year-on-year, producer prices rose by 4.2 percent in August,
against market expectations of a 3.9 percent gain.
    Figures for July were also revised up to 0.7 percent
month-on-month and to and an 18-month high of 4.3 percent
year-on-year.
    Energy prices rose 0.9 percent during August and were 12.0
percent higher than a year earlier.
    Without volatile energy, producer prices were unchanged 
month-on-month and up 1.5 percent year-on-year, confirming the
view of European Central Bank that spiking energy prices are the
main reason for higher inflation.
    Prices at factory gates herald trends in consumer inflation
because unless absorbed by intermediaries or retailers, higher
producer costs translate directly into higher consumer prices.
    The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation
below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. An early
Eurostat estimate showed last week that in September, consumer
inflation was 2.1 percent year-on-year.

    * 12 EU countries have such review mechanisms in place
    * Survey sees growing tide of inbound investment into EU

    BUDAPEST, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament approved
new regulations on Tuesday requiring investors from outside the
European Economic Area to get government clearance before buying
assets seen as sensitive to national security.
    The bill - which still needs to be approved by the president
- follows an EU-wide call for greater scrutiny of foreign
investments, part of a bid to respond to a flurry of Chinese
acquisitions in the bloc. [nL5N1SZ3MO]
    Hungarian government officials said it would not focus on
particular countries, but was meant to keep key sectors - such
as the production of arms and ammunition, financial services and
public utilities - under national control.
    Since sweeping to power in 2010, Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orban's government has reclaimed state control of large
swathes of the economy, buying back stakes in major energy
firms, public utilities and banks from mostly western European
owners.
    The regulations, expected to come into force next year, ""may
impact how many Hungarian merger and acquisition transactions
are structured,"" multinational law firm CMS said in a note.    
    Under the terms of the law, investors from outside the
European Economic Area would have to get government clearance to
buy more than 25 percent of private companies in Hungary, and 10
percent of public companies.
    The bill gives the government the power to decide which
sectors are classed as critical. The clearance process can take
60 days, or longer, if an appeal is lodged, according to the
text of the bill.    
    The bill would allow the state to take action ""against
investors from third countries into certain critical
industries,"" the Interior Ministry said.
    A market survey by CMS said an overwhelming majority of
respondents expect an increase in the number of acquisitions of
European companies by non-European investors next year, with
U.S. buyers dominating, followed by Japan and China.
    Twelve EU countries have such review mechanisms in place,
including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Finland and France.

    By Simon Carraud and Richard Lough
    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - France seized assets belonging to
Iran's intelligence services and two Iranian nationals in
response to a June plot to attack an exiled Iranian opposition
group's rally outside Paris, the government said on Tuesday.
    France had warned Tehran to expect a robust response after
an Iranian diplomat was arrested in Germany suspected of
involvement in a plot to bomb the meeting of the Paris-based
National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).
    U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and
several former European and Arab ministers attended the rally in
Villepinte.
    ""An attempted attack in Villepinte was foiled on June 30. An
incident of such gravity on our national territory could not go
unpunished,"" said a joint statement by the foreign, interior and
economy ministries.
    A spokesman at the Iranian Embassy in Paris did not
immediately respond to a request for comment. There was no
immediate response to the French move from Tehran.
    The asset freezes targeted two individuals identified as
Assadollah Asadi and Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, the French
statement said. A unit within the Iranian intelligence services
was also targetted. 
    The hardening of relations with France could have wider
implications for Iran. France has been one of the strongest
advocates of salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and
world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in
May.
    On Monday, a court in southern Germany said the detained
Iranian diplomat, who is accredited in Austria, could be
extradited to Belgium, where two other individuals suspected of
involvement in the bomb plot were arrested on June 30. 
    They were caught in possession of explosives.    
    Earlier on Tuesday, some 200 police, some of them elite
officers from Paris, swooped at dawn on a Muslim centre in
northeastern France. Two security sources said the raids were
not linked to the asset freezes.

    BRUSSELS/BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) -
"" Unworkable"", ""unacceptable"", ""impasse"" - the words used to
describe Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union do
little to temper concerns that the two are heading for a chaotic
divorce.
    But behind the scenes, both sides are preparing concessions
as part of what one British official called ""a constructive
dialogue"" that could yet lead to a deal.
    Officials and sources on both sides say there is clear will
to try to overcome the obstacles to winning a withdrawal deal
and agreeing a framework for future ties - a Northern Ireland
border and EU-UK trade deal.
    Details are scarce, but the EU is planning to start putting
in writing its offer for future trade ties, a demand Britain has
pressed after officials felt Prime Minister Theresa May was
snubbed at talks in Austria last month.
    Britain has also promised to bring a new proposal to unlock
a standoff over preventing the return to a hard border between
the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland,
possibly by compromising about regulatory controls on goods in
exchange for Brussels embracing the use of technological fixes
for customs checks. 
    With only six months to go before Britain leaves the bloc,
the lack of clarity over the divorce has spooked markets by
increasing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which both sides
say they are working to avoid.
    On Wednesday, May gives a speech to end a fractious annual
conference of her Conservative Party, where Brexit rebels did
much to undermine her stance of maintaining close ties with the
EU.
    On Thursday, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar will be
in Brussels for talks with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel
Barnier. 
    Senior diplomats in Brussels have been summoned to a Brexit
meeting on Friday and Barnier is due to present to them an
initial draft of the bloc's trade proposal soon after, which the
EU hopes would woo Britain into more compromises. 
    While no new dates have been confirmed for the next round of
negotiations between Barnier and British Brexit minister Dominic
Raab, several EU diplomats said they expected them to take place
in Brussels next week. 
    ""It must be next week or it's too late to get anything done
within our six week schedule,"" one person said, referring to a
plan of having a preliminary Brexit deal at the next EU leaders'
summit on Oct.18. 
    The remaining 27 EU states are due to host a summit on Nov.
17-18 to sign off on any agreement with Britain. Otherwise, they
would switch to contingency mode and focus on preparing for a
no-deal Brexit in which Britain leaves next March with no
agreements in place to mitigate the economic shock.
    
    CUSTOMS VS. REGULATORY CHECKS
    British officials have signalled new ideas will come. A
focus will be attempts to come to agreement over customs
arrangements on the island of Ireland to prevent a return to a
hard border that inflamed sectarian differences in the past.
    Raab welcomed Barnier's suggestion that technology could be
used to help resolve the issue after London said it could not
accept the bloc's proposal for Northern Ireland to effectively
stay in the EU's customs union.
    He also said Britain was looking at how regulatory checks on
some goods could be used as part of a solution to move Brexit
talks, notably on a ""backstop deal"" for the Irish border,
forward.
    London has indicated that it may consider options on
regulations on the island of Ireland, noting there are already
some different rules for agriculture and food products between
Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
    But it was not clear whether the government would tolerate
such a difference for manufactured goods. 
    ""We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs backstop
and on the regulatory side of things, we have been clear that we
will, as long as we can carry the communities of Northern
Ireland with us, we will be open to looking at some of the
options on regulatory checks,"" Raab said on the sidelines of
May's Conservative Party annual conference. [nL8N1WH5X3]
    The EU hopes a more developed promise of seeking close ties
with Britain after Brexit could help May build a majority behind
a divorce deal that the bloc insists must include an emergency
fix for the Irish border.
    The bloc has decided to flesh out the declaration on
post-Brexit ties with Britain a bit more to make the case for
Britons more compelling.

    LILLE, France/PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - French police raided
a Muslim faith centre and arrested three of its leaders for
illegal weapons possession in pre-dawn swoops on Tuesday that
government officials said were prompted by suspicion of links to
terrorist organisations. 
    France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community, remains
on maximum alert after attacks in recent years in which Islamist
militants and people inspired by radical groups such as Islamic
State have killed close to 250 people.
    Some 200 police officers including elite troopers from Paris
took part in raids that began under darkness at the Centre Zahra
France and homes of a dozen of its members, in Grande Synthe
near the northern port town of Dunkirk.
    ""This is a counter-terrorism operation,"" the local prefect's
office said a statement.
    ""The activities of Centre Zahra France are under
particularly close watch given its leaders' clear support for
several terrorist organisations and movements espousing ideas
contrary to (French) republican values.""
    Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said three people were put
in custody after the discovery of illegal arms, and that a
prayer room was being shut.
    The raids coincided with an announcement that France had
also seized assets belonging to Iran's intelligence services and
two Iranian nationals over a June plot to attack an exiled
Iranian opposition group's rally outside Paris. [nL8N1WI2L2]
    Two sources said there was no direct link between the raids
and the Iranian intelligence asset freezes. 
    Assets of the Centre Zahra France were frozen too, along
with financial assets held under other names, on orders issued
by France's interior and finance ministry, a notice published in
the official government journal of legal acts said.  
    The centre's website says it has some 8,000  ""followers"" on
social network sites and its goal is to spread the message of
Islam via film, radio, writings and conferences. It also offers
a contact point on social, family and religious matters.
    France, which is historically a predominantly Roman Catholic
country, is officially secular, with separation by law between
matters of state and religion for over a century. It is home to
five million or more Muslims out of a population of 67 million.
    President Emmanuel Macron, under pressure to get tougher on
radical preachers, has promised to produce plans better defining
the place of Islam's representatives in France. A radical imam
was expelled to Algeria last April from a mosque in Marseille.

 (Adds cabinet approval, quotes from ministers, background)
    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Germany's coalition parties agreed
on a new immigration law on Tuesday to attract more skilled
workers from countries outside the European Union, in a
politically risky push to fill a record number of job vacancies
and stabilise the public pension system.
    Record-high employment and falling joblessness have led to a
tightening labour market in Europe's largest economy, with
employers struggling to staff more than a million positions and
work-related bottlenecks limiting overall economic growth.
    As Germany's workforce is expected to shrink over the next
decades due to an ageing population and low birth rates, more
migrants are seen as crucial to help firms find workers whose
pension contributions support the growing number of retirees.
    But the new immigration law, agreed over night by
centre-right Chancellor Angela Merkel, hardline Interior
Minister Horst Seehofer and Social Democrat Labour Minister
Hubertus Heil, risks angering those voters who already feel
neglected following the arrival of more than a million refugees
since 2015.
    The unprecedented influx of asylum seekers, mainly from
Muslim countries in the Middle East, has already caused a
popular backlash and propelled the far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) party into the national parliament. [nL5N1VY57I]
    Seehofer said the compromise deal would remove labour market
hurdles for non-EU citizens with job qualifications and German
language skills while avoiding new incentives for refugees.
    ""We maintain the principle of separation of asylum and
labour migration,"" Seehofer told reporters during a joint new
conference with Heil and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.
    ""With today's agreement, we have made it possible for the
economic upswing to continue without an abrupt end,"" Altmaier
said, adding that it would strengthen Germany's competitiveness
at a time when other countries were espousing stricter
immigration rules.
    
    STIMULATE GROWTH
    ""With this, we can stimulate additional economic growth by
several tenths of a percent. This is quite a lot,"" he added.
    The coalition parties agreed the outline of the law,
approved by cabinet on Tuesday, that companies will be allowed
to recruit foreign workers in all professions, regardless of an
official list of sectors suffering labour shortages.
    The paper also proposes that the government will no longer
insist that companies give preference to German citizens in
filling vacancies before looking for non-EU foreigners.
    In addition, foreign graduates and workers with vocational
training will get an opportunity to come to Germany for six
months to look for a position if they meet certain job
qualifications and German language requirements.
    They also have to prove that they have enough financial
resources so they will not depend on welfare benefits during
their stay in Germany, the parties agreed.
    The parties also found a compromise wording on the disputed
question of how to avoid the deportation of well-integrated
asylum seekers who have found work and learned German.
    Seehofer, whose CSU party fears losing voters to the
far-right in a Bavarian election later this month, was initially
against allowing migrants to switch out of asylum into residency
status. He feared this would encourage future immigration by
asylum seekers without the right skills.
    The parties agreed to define a residence status for rejected
but well-integrated asylum seekers who cannot be deported --
because of security concerns in their home country -- to enable
them to earn a living and to give their employers more security
when planning.
    ""It's a pragmatic solution which ensures that we're not
sending back the right people,"" Heil said.

one that would work on the land border.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona/London-October 02: The EU's new Worldwide Harmonised 
Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has contributed to several car manufacturers 
issuing profit warnings, Fitch Ratings says. This is due to significant one-off 
costs to certify vehicles under the new procedure, heavy discounting to 
liquidate stocks of vehicles that would not be certified on time and 
manufacturing stoppages ahead of the deadline to avoid assembling uncertified 
vehicles. This in turn led to under-absorption of fixed costs in 1H18. 

However, the impact on sales and profits is likely to be temporary as car 
manufacturers have been adjusting to the new procedure and companies may 
partially recoup in 3Q18 and 4Q18 some of the lost production and sales. The 
ratings of car manufacturers are unlikely to be affected by these distortions 
alone due to their short-lived nature. Some remaining issues from WLTP will be 
compounded by the more stringent set of emission targets for 2030, to be decided 
in the coming days.

Manufacturers struggled this summer with certification of their vehicles to meet 
the WLTP - a laboratory test to measure passenger car fuel consumption and 
emissions in the EU - which came into effect on 1 September 2018 and replaced 
the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) procedure. Some manufacturers have 
commented about bottlenecks in the certification process (notably Volkswagen 
(VW), because of the complexity and size of its product portfolio) leading to 
extra costs and missed sales. 

Furthermore, carmakers used heavy price discounting and increased sales in 
unprofitable channels, such as dealer registrations, to liquidate the stocks of 
vehicles that they would not be able to certify to the new requirements. This 
led to unusually high new registrations numbers in the EU during the summer, 
particularly in August, when registrations increased 31% y-o-y, pushing 
year-to-date growth to more than 6%. However, these discounts contributed to 
lower profits for several manufacturers, including VW, BMW and Daimler, 
resulting in profit warnings. We expect lower sales in September and distortions 
affecting sales and earnings for the rest of the year, with sluggish sales 
growth in the coming months.

title=""EU Cars Registrations"" width=""550"" height=""607"" scrolling=""no"" 
frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe> 


WLTP comes in addition to the switch to real driving emissions (RDE) testing, 
which measures emissions in real-world conditions, not in a laboratory 
environment optimised by manufacturers, and will be gradually implemented 
through to 2021.

The switch to WLTP has caused significant bottlenecks in manufacturers' 
production schedules as each model, body type, engine variant and option package 
need to be approved separately under the new procedure. One or various options 
added to a car may have an impact on its fuel efficiency and hence must be 
tested and certified separately, leading to hundreds of individual 
configurations per manufacturer. Testing facilities worked around the clock for 
months but this was insufficient to certify all models on time. 

Longer-term, the WLTP may support a simplification of some manufacturers' 
product portfolio, notably VW, as they streamline their product ranges to save 
costs and avoid the product complexity highlighted by the new testing procedure. 
Some manufacturers have also said that some powertrains may be at risk, 
including plug-in hybrids whose benefit in terms of CO2 emissions, and hence in 
tax benefits offered in some countries, will be reduced.

WLTP also brings significant uncertainty about the upcoming emission-based tax 
regime in the EU as the calculation of CO2 emissions will differ substantially 
between the NEDC and WLTP systems. Reported CO2 emissions will be significantly 
boosted when calculated under the new regime and this could lead to some 
countries significantly increasing taxes on vehicle purchase. This may have a 
negative effect on product mix, putting pressure on the sale of larger cars or 
vehicles with bigger engines, which are typically more profitable.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The leader of
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on whose
support British Prime Minister Theresa May relies on to govern,
said she could no accept different regulation in the province to
the rest of the UK after Brexit.
    The issue of how to avoid a hard border between Northern
Ireland the Irish Republic is the main sticking point in talks
between May and European Leaders on securing a deal for when
Britain leaves the bloc next March.
    Asked if she could ever accept different regulation, even as
a backstop, Foster told Reuters: ""No. This argument was put last
year that the backstop really didn't mean anything and it was
just there as an insurance policy and now it has become the
whole focus of the negotiations. 
    ""That sort of argument has gone now.""
    Foster also queried why the EU was prepared to accept a
technological solution that would work in the Irish Sea but not
one that would work on the land border.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Possible successors
to Prime Minister Theresa May are using the Conservative Party's
annual conference this week to set out, with varying degrees of
subtlety, their visions for Britain, turning the event into a
parade of potential future leaders. [nL8N1WH6ZA]
    May has vowed to fight on as leader to the next election in
2022, but with Brexit dividing her party and exit negotiations
in Brussels deadlocked, the conference has been dominated by the
possibility her government may fall or party members oust her.  
    Below is a summary of interventions by key figures who could
be in the frame to replace May:
    
    BORIS JOHNSON, 54
    The former foreign minister is May's most outspoken critic
over Brexit, using an interview on the eve of conference to
label her exit plan ""deranged"" and grab the limelight from the
prime minister. He resigned from May's cabinet in July in
protest at her handling of the exit negotiations.
    Johnson, regarded by many eurosceptics as the face of the
Brexit campaign, set out his pitch to the membership in a
bombastic speech on Tuesday at a fringe event which was heavily
oversubscribed and had members queuing for hours to get a seat.
[nL8N1WH6ZA]
    He called on the party to return to its traditional values
of low tax and strong policing, and not to try and ape the
policies of the left-wing Labour Party, whose surprise
resurgence deprived May of her parliamentary majority in a 2017
election.
     
    JEREMY HUNT, 51
    Hunt, who replaced Johnson as foreign minister in July, used
his speech on the main stage to urge the Conservative membership
to set aside their differences over Brexit and unite against a
common foe: the EU. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    Hunt voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. He
served six years as Britain's health minister - a role which has
made him unpopular with many voters who work in or rely on the
state-run, financially stretched National Health Service.
    Appealing to Conservatives among both the 48 percent of
Britons who voted to remain in the EU and the 52 percent who
voted to leave, Hunt adopted an uncharacteristically strident
tone at the conference, warning Brussels that ""if you put a
country like Britain in a corner, we don't crumble. We fight"". 
    But, while a comparison between the EU and the Soviet Union
went down well with delegates, it attracted anger from some
inside the EU and was disowned by May. [nL8N1WI1J1]
              
    JACOB REES-MOGG, 49
    A flamboyant millionaire who cultivates the image of an
English gentleman from another century, Rees-Mogg has developed
a cult following among those who want a more radical departure
from the EU than May is proposing. [nL8N1WH1OH]
    He used several appearances at fringe events to advocate a
free trade deal based on the one agreed between the EU and
Canada -- something May says would create an unacceptable border
between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. If not Canada,
Rees-Mogg wants to trade with the EU on World Trade Organization
(WTO) terms.      
    But does he want the top job? When one man shouted ""sack the
woman"" at a mention of May, Rees-Mogg quipped ""certainly not"".
Asked if he would run for leader if May were toppled, Rees-Mogg
said the party should back her.
    ""I know, I know,"" he said when they booed his answer.
    
    DOMINIC RAAB, 44
    Britain's Brexit negotiator is a new face at the top table
of government, promoted when David Davis resigned in protest at
May's exit plan in July. He has taken over the exit
negotiations, albeit in a more subordinate role to May than his
predecessor.
    Like Hunt, Raab used his conference speech to criticise the
EU's approach to negotiations, warning Brussels not to bully
Britain. Raab, a lawyer by training, twinned the message with a
well-received story about his Jewish father's escape from 
Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1938. [nL8N1WH3I3]
    
    SAJID JAVID, 48
    The interior minister had to compete with Johnson's speech
for the members' attention on Tuesday, but used appearances at
fringe events to set out a domestic policy agenda he thinks will
help the Conservatives win the next election.
    Housing, he said, is the biggest problem the party has to
solve to appeal to voters under 40 who have been left with 
""faces pressed up against the estate agents' windows"" by soaring
prices and a shortage of new homes.
    Javid, a second-generation immigrant of Pakistani heritage,
has served a number of cabinet roles and scores consistently
well in polls of party members. A champion of free markets, he
has talked about having a portrait of former Conservative prime
minister Margaret Thatcher on his office wall.
    
    MICHAEL GOVE, 51
    Gove, one of the highest-profile Brexit campaigners during
the referendum, has had to rebuild his cabinet career after
falling early in the contest to replace former prime minister
David Cameron. 
    High-energy, and seen as one of the most effective members
of cabinet in bringing forward new policies, Gove used his
appearances at this week's conference to pledge loyalty to May
and back her Brexit plan.
    In doing so he rejected the rival proposals put forward by
Johnson, with whom he teamed up during their Brexit campaign
only to pull his support for Johnson’s 2016 leadership bid at
the last moment and run himself.

127 million euros behind its tax revenue target for 2018 at the
end of September, limiting the government's room for a more
generous budget package next week, unless, as expected, it
raises money elsewhere.
    Ireland has consistently beaten its revenue target in recent
years, even as it gradually unwinds tax increases introduced
during the financial crisis due to a rapid jobs recovery and the
benefits of being a major location for multinational companies.
    However while corporate tax receipts were 6.3 percent ahead
of target at the end of the third quarter, income tax and
value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1
percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent
underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company
tax gains.
    The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up
year-on-year, the data from the finance department showed on
Tuesday, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
    Assuming fiscal targets are met, Irish Finance Minister
Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million euros to dish out on
further tax cuts and spending increases next year, having
already committed over 2 billion through previously announced
increases in current and capital spending. 
    Donohoe is expected to find extra money through measures
under consideration including the scrapping or part scrapping of
a reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector. [nL5N1UR5SX] 
    With expenditure 0.1 percent behind where the government had
estimated it to be and up 8.9 percent year-on-year, the
exchequer recorded a deficit of 1.47 billion euros for the first
nine months of the year.
    The government expects to run a deficit of 0.2 percent of
economic output this year, although the central bank and
independent fiscal watchdog has urged it to be more prudent and
target a surplus. [nL5N1UN40V]

 (Recasts on deficit target, upgrade of GDP forecasts)
    By Padraic Halpin
    DUBLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ireland expects to hit its budget
deficit target of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product this
year after a sharp hike to its economic growth forecast offset
overspending in some areas and a slightly weaker than
anticipated tax take.
    Ireland's finance department increased its forecast for GDP
growth this year to 7.4 percent from a previous estimate of 5.6
percent and nudged up its projection for next year to 4.2
percent from the 4.0 percent forecast six months ago.
    Irish GDP has outperformed everywhere in Europe since 2014
but the relevance of using the conventional measure of growth
has diminished after a series of distortions related to
Ireland's large multinational sector that hit again this year,
leading to first half growth of 9.1 percent. [nS8N1SB01Z]
    ""We expect to come in bang on the nose in and around a
deficit of 0.2 percent this year as projected, with the good
things being counteracted by overruns in other areas,"" Prime
Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament.
    The main overspending at the end of the third quarter was
again in the health department which was running 301 million
euros or 2.7 percent above profile, data from the finance
department showed on Tuesday.
    While total spending was 0.1 percent behind where the
government had estimated, the money set aside for departments
and capital projects is typically spent by the end of the year.
    The exchequer also remained 0.3 percent or 127 million euros
behind its tax revenue target for 2018 at the end of September,
which analysts said did little to change the arithmetic for next
Tuesday's presentation of the budget for 2019.
    While corporate tax receipts were 6.3 percent ahead of
target at the end of the third quarter, income tax and
value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1
percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent
underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company
tax gains.
    The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up
year-on-year, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
    Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million
euros to dish out on further tax cuts and spending increases
next year, having already committed over 2 billion through
previously announced increases in current and capital spending. 
    Donohoe is expected to find extra money through measures
under consideration including the scrapping or part-scrapping of
a reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector, although he is also
under pressure from the country's central bank to target a
budget surplus next year instead of the planned minor deficit.
[nL5N1UR5SX] 
    ""With Brexit uncertainties looming, it remains to be seen
whether the minister will aim for a cautious budget, eschewing
large giveaways, in favour of a more ambitious target for a
surplus,"" Davy Stockbrokers chief economist Conall MacCoille
wrote in a note.

and instant retail payment system to stop overseas competitors
taking this market and the European Central Bank should consider
taking a bigger role in the field, ECB board member Yves Mersch
said on Wednesday.
    Instant payment systems are already in place from mobile
payment services to point-of-sale payments but most are limited
in their geographic reach, leaving PayPal and big American IT
firms dominating the market.
    ""Payment service providers around Europe need to start
offering their customers instant payment services. And they need
to do so quickly,"" Mersch told a conference in Riga.
    ""To promote euro area-wide, smooth and efficient payment
systems in line with our mandate, we might even have to reflect
on whether broader access to central bank accounts for retail
purposes may be needed,"" he added.
    Such a system would only work if it is truly pan-European,
instant, cheap and not restricted to a particular group of
clients, Mersch added.
    PayPal now dominates the European market for online payments
but players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Chinese
giants like Alibaba and Tencent are also taking market share.
    Mersch added that ultimately it will be the responsibility
of each service provider to gain the necessary size but noted
that the November launch of the ECB's instant payment system
between banks, called TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, could
provide a foundation.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
tumbled on Wednesday on reports that Rome plans to cut the
budget deficit faster than expected, easing fears about the
fiscal policy of the euro zone's third- biggest economy.
    Italy's government foresees the budget deficit falling to
2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent
in 2021 from the 2.4 percent expected next year, a government
source from the right-wing League party said on Wednesday
[nI6N1VP01Z].
    That bought relief to the bond market. It has taken a
beating since the coalition - of which the League is a member -
said last week it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
over the next three years, tripling the previous target.
    Italian bond yields fell six to 19 basis points across the
board, after four days of sharp rises <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>.    
     The 10-year Italian government bond yield fell 10 bps to
3.33 percent <IT10YT=RR>. It pulled back from the 4 1/2-year
high around 3.46 percent it reached on Tuesday, when comments
from a lawmaker about Italy's position in the euro bloc fuelled
a selloff. 
     Wednesday's fall in Italian yields left the gap over
benchmark German bond yields <DE10YT=RR>, a closely followed
indicator of relative country risks, at 290 bps -- down from
around 300 bps late Tuesday.
    ""The deficit forecast news is main reason markets are doing
what they are doing today,"" said KBC rates strategist Mathias
van der Jeugt.
    ""But this is too little to bridge the gap between the EU and
Italy. We might get some more relief, but I think it will be
short-lived unless Italy comes up with a better proposal that is
more aligned with what the EU wants.""
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which only emerged from its third international bailout
in August [nL8N1WI4KW]. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to meet with
ministers to discuss the budget targets for 2019-2021 at around
1100 GMT on Wednesday, a source told Reuters.
    The 2020-2021 deficit numbers were first reported by the
newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, lifting the
euro <EUR=> during Asian trade [nL4N1WJ0I0]. 
    The euro was last up 0.3 percent against the dollar. Italian
shares rose 1.3 percent <.FTMIB>, outperforming European stocks
overall <.STOXX>.
    As Italy's bond market rebounded, yields on higher-rated
euro zone bonds rose. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up three
bps at 0.46 percent.
    ""The (Italian) situation remains fluid and mood can make
sudden U-turns, depending on a rather unpredictable news flow,""
analysts at UniCredit said in a note.

its investment recommendation on two-year Italian government
bonds to overweight, following a budget related selloff in the
country's debt. 
    Italian two-year government bond yields have risen around 50
basis points in the past week, after the country's government
revealed on Thursday a higher-than-anticipated budget deficit of
2.4 percent for 2019. 
    But short-dated bonds now look attractive versus cash, UBS
Wealth said in a note, adding that two-year yields offered
around 160 basis points over comparably rated euro-denominated
bonds. 
    ""While we believe that Italy's credit rating is likely to be
downgraded by one notch, the country is likely to retain an
investment grade rating for at least the next 12 months, and we
believe there is only a very low probability that Italy will
default within the next two years,"" Mark Haefele, global chief
investment officer at UBS Wealth, said in the note. 
    However, UBS Wealth cautioned against holding long-dated
Italian bonds, and advised against any concentrated exposure to
them. 
    It noted possible risks associated with the position,
including escalating tensions between Italy and the European
Union over the budget, a breakdown of the current coalition
government, or a departure of Finance Minister Giovanni Tria.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The cash-strapped
country raised more money than expected thanks to the canny way
it sold mobile spectrum. The consequences are for others. If
operators raise prices, it’s effectively a stealth tax. If they
can’t, there will be less cash to build new networks in Europe.

must focus on getting a divorce deal with an emergency Irish
border fix before they embark on discussions on their
post-Brexit trade ties, the Czech Republic's pointman on Europe
said. 
    Britain is due to leave the EU in 177 days but talks on
managing the unprecedented split have stalled over differences
on how to avoid border checks between EU member Ireland and
Britain's province of Northern Ireland afterwards.
    Eyes are on British Prime Minister Theresa May's final
speech at her Tory Party conference on Wednesday. [nL8N1WI5PB] A
flurry of activity will follow as both sides seek to try to
break the deadlock in time for EU summits on Oct.18 and
Nov.17-18 at the latest. [nL8N1WI4Y0]
    ""The chief concern for the EU right now is reaching a deal
on the Withdrawal Agreement that would provide us with a two
year transition period in which to set out the future
relationship between the EU and the UK,"" State Secretary for
European Affairs Ales Chmelar said in a comment to Reuters,
adding that divorce must cover an Irish fix. 
    That differs from Britain's preferred option of focusing on
agreeing close future ties in trade. London wants this
post-Brexit arrangement to regulate the Irish border but the
bloc wants an emergency solution if trade talks fail or take
longer.
    ""The future relationship ... is a matter for future
discussions. Without the Withdrawal Agreement we are, very soon,
heading towards a no deal scenario in which a hard border would
inevitably be drawn up,"" Chmelar said. 
    As both sides ready concessions in the coming days, Britain
is expected to present a new proposal for the Irish border soon.
    From the EU side, the other 27 member states will put in
writing for the first time next week their free trade proposal
for Britain for after Brexit, hoping a more fleshed-out promise
would woo London into compromises on Ireland and help May get
enough support behind any divorce deal.

    LISBON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Europe's largest tech event, the
Web Summit, will remain in Lisbon for another 10 years, its
founder Paddy Cosgrave said on Wednesday in a boost to
Portugal's aspirations of becoming a technology hub.
    ""Staying here for another 10 years brings us so much
certainty,"" Cosgrave told journalists at a press conference
where he was joined by Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.
""My heart and the team's heart is in Lisbon.""
    Lisbon scored a big coup when Web Summit moved from Dublin
to Portugal in 2016, helping a recovery in the country's capital
after the 2011-2014 debt crisis. 
    Web Summit has helped put Lisbon on the map and drive a
tourist boom, as well as attract technology firms to the city.
    ""It's a pleasure to host Web Summit in Portugal for the next
10 years,"" Costa said. ""It puts Portugal at the heart of the
global conversation about tech and innovation.""
    The government estimates that the event itself generates 300
million euros ($347 million) for Lisbon in hotel and other
revenue during the week it takes place in November.
    Around 70,000 people attended the Web Summit last year and
the organisers hope to boost that to 100,000. 
    The original Web Summit contract envisioned three years in
Lisbon and the Web Summit organizers had considered moving to
other venues in Europe before deciding to stay. 
    The event is held in the pavilions built for Lisbon's 1998
World Fair and one of the reasons the organizers decided to stay
is because it can expand further in that area.

    MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Spain should rein in its debt and
deficit and maintain labour market reforms to resist future
shocks as downside risks to the economy build, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday.
    The IMF trimmed its forecast for 2018 growth in the euro
zone's fourth-largest economy to 2.7 percent, in line with the
Socialist government's expectations, from the 2.8 percent
forecast it made in April.
    The Spanish economy is showing signs of flagging after 19
consecutive quarters of growth, but is still on track to remain
among the fastest growing in Europe. [nL5N1VR5MP]    
    ""At this juncture, it is critical to strengthen the
economy's resilience to withstand shocks,"" the IMF said in the
concluding statement of its 2018 report on Spain. 
    ""Two policy areas are key for this goal: restarting
structural fiscal adjustment and preserving the thrust of the
labour market reforms"" introduced by the previous conservative
government, it added.
    Debt levels have only come down marginally while the economy
has grown strongly, making the government's aim to cut the
deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP for 2019 ""critical and
appropriate"", the IMF said. 
    It urged the government to preserve the thrust of the 2012
labour market reform, which included wage flexibility that ""has
underpinned Spain's job-rich economic recovery and regained
competitiveness"".   
    A sustainable and comprehensive pension package is also
needed to address current tensions in the system, the IMF said.

deficit in 2019 at 2.4 but could agree to reduce the gap in 2020
and 2021.

2019 when Rome submits its draft to Brussels on Oct 15th, or
also the deficit plan for 2020 and 2021, the spokesman said the
assessment would concern only 2019.
    He added it would do so in the context of the Commission's
own economic forecasts for 2020 and 2021.

    MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Former International Monetary Fund
chief Rodrigo Rato will have to serve a four-and-a-half year
jail sentence for misusing company credit cards when he worked
at state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>, Spain's Supreme Court
confirmed on Wednesday.
    Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent
figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the
IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state
bailout in 2012.
    In 2017, the court considered Rato responsible for
overseeing the misuse of credit cards and said he could have
reversed the practice that involved dozens of other executives
and board members of Bankia.
    Rato had appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing,
arguing the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were
legal.
    The case is one of several high-level corruption
investigations now coming to fruition and has been seen as a
test of whether Spain's rich and powerful are accountable before
the law.

    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, according to the
country's central bank.
    The European Union member country has been rocked by
revelations that banks there laundered money from Russia,
Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank accounts. The
scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and neighbouring Latvia to
shut down.
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all flows, including resident and
non-resident transactions, a spokesman said. 
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the flows suspicious.
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident, cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    A central bank spokesman told Reuters the bank does not have
specific data for non-resident transactions.
    Nordic banking shares fell after the Bloomberg report.
Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking operations in
Estonia, were trading 5.4 percent and 7.2 percent lower,
respectively.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market.
Swedbank declined to comment.
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

    WARSAW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Ireland does not want a notional
border to emerge in the Irish Sea that would divide Northern
Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom, Irish Foreign
Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday.
    Brexit negotiators are seeking to resolve a standoff over
how to prevent the return of border checks between Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland by looking at how regulatory
checks on some goods between the two islands could be used as
part of a solution to move talks forward. [nL8N1WI4Y0]
    Dublin is trying to convince pro-British politicians in
Northern Ireland that this would not amount to a constitutional
challenge to the British province's status, prompting Coveney's
remarks at a news conference during a visit to Warsaw.
    ""We don't want to see any border on the Irish Sea but the
commitment to an Irish backstop of last December is very clear,""
Coveney said, referring to the ""insurance policy"" backstop
arrangement all sides agreed to in principle over how to retain
an open border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
    ""We are not trying to create new barriers to trade between
Northern Ireland and the (rest of the) United Kingdom. We
believe it is possible to find the balance and the compromise to
get this done... Ireland is happy to show some flexibility.""
    The small Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
that props up Britain's minority Conservative government
strongly resists any suggestion that there may need to be
regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of
the UK after Brexit.
    DUP leader Arlene Foster described it earlier on Wednesday
as a ""blood red"" line, in a ratcheting-up of the party's
rhetoric. [nL9N1W700E]

    By Richard Lough
    PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - France's Emmanuel Macron faced
mounting questions about the durability of his government on
Wednesday after the resignation of a third minister in five
weeks, testing the political newcomer's ability to hold an
administration together.
    Gerard Collomb, 71, a former Socialist Party stalwart who
backed Macron early in his presidential bid and was seen as a
mentor, resigned after a public battle of wills with 40-year-old
Macron. [nL8N1WI585] 
    The loss of a close ally and one of the most senior
ministers in the government is a heavy blow for the president,
whose popularity has fallen sharply in opinion polls and is
struggling to inject new energy into his reform drive.
    In refusing to toe the line after Macron at first rejected
his resignation, Collomb ended up exposing the president's
relative political inexperience, commentators said.
    ""This is a challenge to Macron's Jupiterian way of trying to
run the presidency,"" said Jonathan Fenby, author of The History
of Modern France, referring to Macron's early casting of himself
as a Jupiter-like figure - one who sits above the political fray
and hands down messages like the Roman god of gods.
    As Collomb formally handed his portfolio to Prime Minister
Edouard Philippe at an icy ceremony on Wednesday, tensions were
barely disguised.
    Collomb's subdued demeanour appeared to reflect the poor
relations that have existed since a scandal erupted in July over
an Elysee Palace bodyguard caught on camera beating protesters.
The Elysee's slow response tainted Macron's transparent image. 
    Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told heckling
lawmakers on Wednesday that there was no crisis. But Macron and
Philippe now face a delicate balancing act as they search for a
new interior minister from a political party without deep roots,
one formed around Macron's start-up presidential campaign.
    The president has already lost his popular environment
minister and the sports minister, though Collomb's problems
mainly lay with Macron's seeming arrogance, while policy
differences are at the heart of the departure of the two other
ministers.[nL8N1W40RV]
    ""He doesn't have the strength in depth that an established
party would have,"" said Fenby.
    
    ""LACK OF HUMILITY""
    While a full-on government collapse is unlikely, the
drip-drip of resignations has hindered Macron's ability to push
ahead with reforms on a tight schedule. Macron himself does not
face a re-election challenge until 2022.
    Collomb, who had spoken of a ""lack of humility"" inside
Macron's team, first announced his desire to resign in a
magazine interview two weeks ago, implying he would step down in
2019 to run as mayor of Lyon after the European elections. 
    Opponents were quick to berate Macron for trying to hold on
to a lame-duck minister who has to preside over one of France's
most sensitive portfolios. The country is still reeling from
militant attacks that have killed some 240 people since 2015. 
    ""Things have badly deteriorated,"" Collomb said on Wednesday,
standing alongside Philippe and referring to conditions in the
rundown suburbs of France's biggest cities. 
    ""Today, it's not the rule of the Republic that prevails but
rather of drug traffickers and radical Islamists.""
    Macron's advisers made clear the timing of Collomb's
departure would be on their terms. But on Tuesday, Collomb
insisted on quitting his post, backing Macron into a corner and
forcing him to agree.
    ""If (Collomb) wanted to show ... that the head of state had
lost his control of events and that he lacked the experience and
indispensable reflexes needed for his job, the ex-minister could
not have done it any better,"" Le Monde wrote in an editorial.

    DUBLIN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Facebook's <FB.O> lead regulator
in the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner
(DPC), on Wednesday commenced an investigation into a massive
cyberattack on the social networking site that the company
disclosed last week.
    Facebook said on Friday that hackers had stolen login codes
that allowed them to access nearly 50 million Facebook accounts,
its worst-ever security breach given the unprecedented level of
potential access. [nL4N1WE5P5]
    ""In particular, the investigation will examine Facebook's
compliance with its obligation under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) to implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures to ensure the security and safeguarding
of the personal data it processes,"" the DPC said in a statement.
    Under the new GDPR European privacy regulations which came
into effect in May, breaking privacy laws can result in fines of
up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever
is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros
previously.
    The DPC, which regulates a number of U.S. multinationals
with European headquarters in Dublin, said Facebook informed it
that their own internal investigation is continuing and that the
company continued to take remedial actions to mitigate the
potential risk to users.
    Facebook said on Tuesday that investigators had determined
that the hackers did not access other sites that use the social
networking site's single sign-on. [nL8N1R23NV]
    Some security experts, including a former Facebook
executive, said the company may have painted a worst-case
scenario when it disclosed the attack on Friday to ensure
compliance with the strict new European Union privacy rules.
    GDPR imposes steep penalties if companies fail to follow
rules that include a requirement that they disclose breaches
within 72 hours of discovery. That is a tight window that
security experts say does not give investigators adequate time
to determine the impact of the breach.
    Facebook's latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017,
but the company first identified it on Tuesday of last week.

    TIRANA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Albania's central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate at the historic low of 1 percent on
Wednesday and signalled there would be no change before next
April.
    Speaking after the bank's board meeting, Governor Gent Sejko
said they had also kept unchanged the rates on one-day deposit
and lending rates respectively at 0.1 and 1.9 percent.
    ""The supervisory board believes... the normalisation of
interest rates in the internal financial market will not start
before the second trimester of 2019,"" Sejko told reporters.
    The bank has steadily cut the benchmark rate since 2008,
from 6.25 percent to the current level of 1 percent, to spur
lending and growth as it seeks to hit its annual inflation
target of 3 percent.
    Albania's economy grew by 4.3 percent in the first half of
2018 and a similar trend was observed in the third quarter,
Sejko said.
    Growth came from private spending and investment, exports
and electricity production in the first quarter, helped by an
improving international economic environment.
    Sejko said monetary stimulus would be needed to guarantee
stable growth in the medium term, adding that the intensity of
the stimulus would diminish in line with the growth performance 
and the speed with which inflation returns to target.
    He said the bank saw inflation, which was slightly higher on
an annual basis at 2.3 and 2.2 percent in July and August
respectively, hitting the 3 percent annual target in 2020.
    ""This dynamic (of inflation) will be backed by the continued
expansion of aggregate demand, leading to higher employment,
wages and profit margins,"" Sejko said.
    Sejko said the board thought that demand and supply for hard
currency, mostly euros, were stable and the appreciation of the
lek to the euro represented ""a lower threat to inflation"". 
    The euro fell to its lowest level to the lek in 10 years in
June before the bank intervened to buy euros. At the end of the
tourism season, Sejko said the demand and supply ratio for hard
currency was ""balanced"" although the bank had not intervened.

towards harmonising corporate tax rates and ensuring foreign
internet giants pay more tax will further fuel populism in the
European Union, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in
a German newspaper interview.
    In an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Le Maire
urged Germany to support France's efforts to introduce a
Europe-wide digital tax.
    He repeated his call, unpopular in German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's conservative bloc, for a central euro zone budget,
warning that the EU single currency would not survive without
one in the long term.
    His comments, made to the paper after a meeting of euro zone
finance ministers in Luxembourg and published on Wednesday
evening, come as Berlin's unwieldy government coalition
struggles to revive its policy agenda after weeks of rowing over
everything from the retrofitting of dirty diesel cars to
migration and the threat of right-wing extremism.
    ""The domestic political situation cannot become an excuse to
delay urgent European policy decisions,"" he was quoted as
saying. ""Not taking decisions now feeds populism. It is better
to act fast and fine-tune later.""
    European citizens ""will not understand if digital companies
like Google or Amazon or Chinese internet companies pay less
than all other companies,"" he said, urging Germany to cast aside
its caution in dealing with the U.S. and its internet giants.
    ""Who are we afraid of? The U.S.?"" he asked. ""It should be
clear by now that Donald Trump only respects those who show
strength and resolution,"" he said, adding that the size of the
EU market gives Brussels leverage over Amazon and Facebook.
    Calls for a euro zone budget have been greeted with great
scepticism in traditionally parsimonious Germany, but Le Maire
said possible future economic crises would endanger the single
currency without one.
    ""There will be a euro zone budget or else there will one day
no longer be a euro zone,"" he said.
    He added that France's budget deficit, which came in below
the EU's ceiling of 3 percent of economic output in 2017 for the
first time in a decade, would come in below the target in 2018
and 2019 as well.

restrictions on cash withdrawals from domestic bank accounts and
a further easing of capital controls are credit positive for its
banks, ratings agency Moody's said on Thursday.
    The ending of the withdrawal restrictions and an increase in
the amount of money that can be transferred abroad - part of
measures to ease controls imposed three years ago - went into
effect on Oct. 1. [nL8N1WD4MJ]
    Capital controls were put in place in June 2015 amid
political and economic turmoil to stem deposit outflows from
Greek banks. 
    ""Improving economic prospects and an increase in
private-sector deposits allowed for the easing of capital
controls, which will likely strengthen depositors' confidence
and help banks further improve their funding profiles, a credit
positive,"" Moody's said in a report.
    The gradual return of deposits to the banking system over
the past seven months and optimism after Greece's successful
exit from its third bailout programme were the key drivers
behind the decision to loosen capital controls, the agency said.
    In addition, a material reduction in banks’ dependence on
central bank funding through the Bank of Greece’s Emergency
Liquidity Assistance (ELA) mechanism points to a liquidity
improvement in recent quarters.
    ""The easing of restrictions will likely encourage households
and companies to return to local banks any money held outside of
Greece's banking system,"" Moody's said.
    Banks' Emergency Liquidity Assistance balance fell to about
4.5 billion euros ($5.16 billion), or 2 percent of total assets,
at the end of August from 21 percent in August 2015.
    Three of six rated Greek banks - Piraeus <BOPr.AT>, National
Bank <NBGr.AT> and PanCretan Cooperative Bank - have fully
repaid their ELA balances.
    But domestic politics and social instability remained risks
to the economic recovery. ""A potential prolonged political
uncertainty, combined with looser capital controls, could cause
significant deposit outflows,"" Moody's said.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Britain issued statements
overnight accusing Russian military intelligence of directing a
host of cyber attacks aimed at undermining Western democracies
by sowing confusion in everything from sport to transport and
the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has yet to respond
but has in the past repeatedly denied such accusations. The
Dutch Ministry of Defense and UK officials are scheduled to hold
a news conference in the Hague this morning that's also expected
to be about Russian intelligence activities. In the wake of the
Skripal poisoning, Britain has been active in trying to persuade
other European capitals to back further sanctions on Moscow.
    Irish PM Leo Varadkar heads to Brussels as the decisive
period for Brexit negotiations begins. The core of the
discussion today will be about the European Union stance in
resolving the disagreement with the UK on managing the Irish
border after Brexit: the aim is still to get much of the deal
worked out by the EU summit later this month. The FT reports
that Dublin would back any push by Theresa May to keep all the
UK in a temporary customs union with the EU until a permanent
arrangement was worked out - something Brussels has until now
balked at.
    France's Emmanuel Macron visits Charles de Gaulle's grave
today on the 60th anniversary of the French constitution, which
de Gaulle introduced in 1958 with sweeping powers for the office
of president. Macron will no doubt pay homage to his predecessor
and to the stabilising effects which the constitution had on
France, at the time seriously buffeted by the aftermath of the
Algerian conflict. The added piquancy of the event is that
Macron is still aiming to revamp the charter to cut the number
of lawmakers by a third and introduce an unaccustomed dose of
proportional representation. 
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
Growing evidence the U.S. economy is picking up steam just as
the rest of the world cools has catapulted 10-year U.S. Treasury
yields to their highest in seven years and the dollar to its
strongest in six weeks, unnerving global markets fearful of the
rising cost of dollar funding around the world. Outsize gains in
U.S. September business confidence and private-sector payrolls
saw markets rush on Wednesday to fully price in the four more
U.S. interest rate rises that the Federal Reserve has been
signalling, and which Fed chief Jerome Powell reinforced this
week by describing the U.S. economy as ""remarkably positive"".
Ten-year Treasury yields climbed more than 10 basis points on
Wednesday to their highest since 2011, the biggest one-day gain
since just after the U.S. election in November 2016. They 
extended that climb overnight to as high as 3.23 percent and 
the 2-10-year U.S. yield curve steepened above 30 basis points
for the first time since July. The dollar’s rise was broad-
based, with dollar/yen rising to the year’s highs and
euro/dollar falling below $1.15 for the first time since
mid-August. 
    With Brent crude oil prices rising above $86 per barrel,
many emerging markets heavily dependent on dollar borrowing and
energy imports are feeling the heat. Hong Kong, Seoul and
Jakarta benchmark indices all fell more than 1 percent overnight
with Japan’s Nikkei in the red too. India’s rupee hit another
record low and Indonesia’s rupiah fell to its weakest in 20
years. MSCI’s emerging-market equity index suffered its biggest
fall in four months. 
    Buoyed by both the upbeat economic news and the approach of
a third-quarter U.S. earnings season next week that’s likely to
clock annul profit growth in excess of 20 percent, the S&P500
came within a sliver of record highs late Wednesday – even
though the bond market disturbance has seen futures drop 0.5
percent today. European stock futures are marked down by a
similar amount as European government bond yields rose in tandem
with Treasuries.

87,370,505,1129,f1fbe237b9b221ca14a8b4da9ac27db9,"World Bank raises growth forecasts for Western Balkans, urges investments",2018-10-04 16:00:01,EUR,-0.17611,2018-10-04 16:00:13,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    BELGRADE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The World Bank revised higher
its 2018 economic growth forecast for the Western Balkans to 3.5
percent, up from a previous 3.2 percent, but said more
investments and exports were needed for  faster and more
sustainable expansion.
    In a report published on Thursday, the bank said the region,
which comprises Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro
and Serbia, would also grow by 3.5 percent in 2019 and by 3.8
percent in 2020.
    The lender said tax reforms and faster growth had led to
higher revenues which some countries used for spending and
capital investments.
    ""But such effects are temporary and costly to sustain: in
the longer term they heighten fiscal vulnerability,"" it said.
    Before the 2008 global financial crisis, the Balkan states
had average growth of 5 to 7 percent a year. Most have since
sought to dispose of state-run firms and reduce their public
sectors to cut deficits and debt.
    The 2018 growth forecasts have also been revised higher for
most of the individual countries in the region, the bank said. 
    Kosovo and Albania are expected to grow by 4 percent, while
Montenegro’s growth is projected at 3.8 percent, down from 4.3
percent last year. 
    Growth in Bosnia would be stable at an estimated 3.2
percent, the report said. Serbia’s economy has rebounded to 3.5
percent growth after last year’s weather-related slowdown. 
    Macedonia’s growth also recovered from stagnation in 2017 to
2.5 percent this year, on restored investors confidence.
    In the report, the World Bank welcomed the creation of more
than 90,000 jobs across the region in the first half of 2018,
but said the labour market response to growth was slow. 
    ""In some countries, inactivity and emigration rather than
new job creation explain the fall in unemployment,"" it said.
    The World Bank urged more investments and exports to help
boost growth. Bosnia, Macedonia, and Serbia have all seen a rise
in their exports, but consumption and large infrastructure
projects have also pushed up imports, the report said.
    The bank also warned about risks including a possible
tightening of financing conditions in international capital
markets and domestic and regional political stability.

Central Bank to give financial markets an extended guidance on
future interest rate moves will diminish once inflation bounces
back enough, ECB policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday.
    The comments suggest that the debate about the ECB's
guidance remains open after board members Benoit Coeure and
Peter Praet both argued recently that the bank may need to
provide an even longer view on the expected path of interest
rates beyond an initial hike. [nL8N1W66BW]
    The ECB now guides markets for steady rates ""through"" the
summer of 2019, suggesting a move sometime in the final quarter
of the year.
    ""The need for extended forward guidance on monetary policy
will also diminish, once inflation has reached sufficient
progress towards the price stability objective,"" Rehn, also the
Governor of Finland's central bank, said in a statement.
    ""As it stands, financial market expectations concerning the
timing of the first interest rate rise are consistent with the
Governing Council's statements,"" Rehn added.
    The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent and does
not expect to hit this level before the end of the decade as the
currency bloc is still struggling to absorb economic slack.
    Steering market expectations has been a key challenge for
central banks across the world since the start of the financial
crisis in 2008 as policymakers battled a lending freeze and
fears of an unprecedented depression.
    The ECB expects rates to rise only very slowly and a
longer-term guidance could stop investors from pricing in more
aggressive moves and keep borrowing conditions low for longer.
    After years of aggressive stimulus, the ECB has been
preparing investors for the end of its 2.6 trillion-euro ($3.00
trillion) bond-buying programme in December and for the first
interest rate increase since 2011 sometime after the summer of
next year.

Thursday as Brexit talks enter a frenzied fortnight designed to
produce a divorce deal with Britain and a blueprint for future
ties. 
    The Brexit countdown begins with Varadkar meeting EU
leaders' chairman Donald Tusk and the bloc's Brexit negotiator
Michel Barnier later on Thursday. 
    Barnier will on Friday meet politicians from Northern
Ireland where the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on which
British Prime Minister Theresa May relies to govern, is key to
sealing any agreement to end Britain's four decades in the bloc.
    ""It will be long hours and it may get messy but there will
be a deal. The cost of no-deal is just too big,"" said a senior
EU diplomat of the talks, aimed at agreeing a fix to the Irish
border in time for an Oct.17-18 EU summit and then the outline
of post-Brexit ties by another one on Nov.17-18. 
    Both sides are readying concessions and will exchange papers
on the main potential deal-breaker - avoiding extensive border
checks between EU-state Ireland and Britain's province of
Northern Ireland after Brexit - as well as future ties. 
    If they fail to agree, Britain is bound to leave the bloc
next March with little or no agreements in place to mitigate the
economic shock and broad disruptions expected from air traffic
to car production to food trade. 
    Should the leaders of the 27 EU states remaining in the bloc
have no Brexit deal to sign off in November, they are due to
move into contingency mode, stepping up preparations for a
disorderly British departure. 
    Some diplomats and officials say talks could drag on through
December, or even January, but any deal must also be ratified by
both British and EU parliaments in time for Brexit day on March
29, 2019.

playing down fears that Italy's troubles could spread to others,
like Portugal, Spain or Greece.

    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Italy's populist government on
Thursday dismissed concerns that the European Commission will
reject its plan to hike deficit spending next year and signalled
that it would not backtrack, even under market pressure.
    After a selloff hit Italian bonds on Tuesday, the government
made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League late on Wednesday watered down its original
plan to keep its deficit steady at 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2020-21. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But it stuck to its 2.4 percent target for next year, and on
Thursday morning government officials said they had no plans to
make further revisions to that goal, which is three times more
than one set out by the previous government.
    Speaking about the multi-year budget targets that must be
reviewed by Brussels by mid-month, Deputy Economy Minister
Massimo Garavaglia said on Thursday: ""(Either) it passes or it
doesn't, but this isn't the problem. We're more focused on what
is happening in the markets.""
    Garavaglia also said the government's GDP growth forecast
for next year, which has yet to be published, would be 1.6
percent, much higher than the 1.2 percent median projection of
51 analysts polled by Reuters last month.
    The gap between Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields and
their safer German equivalent on Tuesday widened to more than
300 basis points, its widest since May, on concerns about
Italy's plans. On Thursday, the spread was at 278 basis points.
    League leader Matteo Salvini, speaking on RAI state radio,
said that next year's deficit spending was needed to spark
growth and create jobs, and added that the government would not
back down even if the spread widened to 400 basis points.
    ""This is a budget that looks to the future, and we will
absolutely not go backwards,"" Salvini said.
    The government's confident tone came as la Repubblica
newspaper reported that the commission had already sent Italian
officials an informal note saying it would reject next year's
spending plans.
    Sources close to economic commissioners in Brussels said the
report was ""unfounded"". The commission must formally give its
opinion on the budget forecasts by the end of the month.
    Separately, deputy prime minister and 5-Star leader Luigi Di
Maio denied an article in Il Fatto Quotidiano saying the
government was seeking a cabinet reshuffle, mainly to replace
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria in December or January.
    Di Maio also seemed unfazed by concern expressed earlier
this week by commissioners and EU allies over the deficit
spending plans.
    ""We have brought home the people's budget, and we're going
to forge ahead more determined than before,"" Di Maio said in an
interview with Radio Radicale. ""Now we can start a serious and
healthy discussion with the European Commission to reach a
positive conclusion.""

    DUBLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ireland's central bank has seen a

    Although Lane reiterated that Brexit will be negative for
Ireland's economy and financial system, the growth of its
international financial centre as a result of neighbouring
Britain leaving the bloc is seen as one of the opportunities.
    Barclays, Legal & General Investment Management and Standard
Life Aberdeen are among the companies who have chosen Dublin as
a post-Brexit base against stiff competition from rival centres
including Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris.
    The Irish Central Bank's Director of Asset Management
Supervision Michael Hodson said last week that the bank had seen
a sizeable number of fund management companies seeking to
relocate to Ireland.
    He also warned that firms who had not yet lodged their
applications would face a challenge to get authorised by March
2019, when Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc.

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - New British proposals for
avoiding extensive border checks on the island of Ireland after
Brexit are ""a step in the right direction"" and ""make finding a
compromise possible"", a European Union source close to the
negotiations told Reuters on Thursday.
    Brexit talks are entering a frenzied fortnight designed to
produce an EU divorce deal with Britain and a blueprint for
future ties. 
    Avoiding erecting an elaborate border between EU-state
Ireland and Britain's province of Northern Ireland after Brexit
is the main potential deal-breaker.
    Britain wants to regulate the border through a broad
agreement on post-Brexit trade ties with the EU.
    The bloc says an emergency fix - or ""backstop"" - is needed
in case these broader trade talks fail or take longer after
Britain leaves the EU next March and the status-quo transition
period runs its course at the end of 2020. 
    Both sides are readying concessions on the Irish backstop. 
    EU diplomats and officials described the emerging new
British proposal under which Britain would agree to an
indefinite backstop solution - something that was missing in
London's previous proposal rejected by the remaining 27 EU
states last June. 
    But Britain would stick to its line that, in case a backstop
is triggered, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a
customs union together with the EU. That would mean having the
same external tariff on some goods, as the EU currently has with
Turkey. 
    Under the British proposal described by EU sources, that
would remove the need for customs checks on goods and
agriculture on the island of Ireland. 
    For the other type of checks, the regulatory ones, Britain
would agree to simplified, light controls that would be carried
out away from the actual border as much as possible, according
to EU sources describing the emerging proposal. 
    ""This is a step in the right direction, it makes finding a
compromise possible,"" one EU source close to the negotiations
told Reuters on Thursday. 
    Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar arrives in Brussels to
meet European Union officials later on Thursday.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European Union regulators have
recognised the need to cooperate with their UK counterparts to
avoid disorderly markets if no agreement is reached on the terms
of the UK's departure from the EU, Britain's financial watchdog
said on Thursday.
    Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct
Authority, said he welcomed comments on Wednesday from the EU's
top securities regulator that memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) with British regulators were now in the works.
    The MoUs would be in place before Brexit to ensure that
regulators could continue to exchange information, critical for
spotting and dealing with rulebreakers, and supervise
cross-border activity, said Steven Maijoor, chair of the
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) [nL8N1WJ3C4].
    Maijoor also signalled a need to ensure that clearing of
euro-denominated derivatives by UK-based clearing houses can
continue after next March.
    ""I am very encouraged by what Steven said yesterday. It's a
recognition on both sides that we are working together and we
will put in place what is needed to make this as smooth a
transition as it can be,"" Bailey told a City & Financial
conference.
    Markets are worried that a hard Brexit would disrupt
insurance policies and derivatives contracts worth up to 29
trillion pounds ($37.67 trillion) between customers in the EU
and Britain, the region's biggest financial market.
    The EU has been saying it is up to the private sector to
deal with those issues, but Maijoor's comments on cooperation
signal a shift to a more helpful stance.
    Bailey said preparations for Brexit were entering an
intensive phase to ensure an orderly departure, though firms are
not relying on this.
    Banks, insurers and asset managers are opening hubs in
cities like Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg or Dublin by March to
ensure continued service to EU customers.
    Ireland's central bank said on Thursday it was processing
over 100 Brexit-related applications from London-based companies
examining moves there [nL8N1WK2C4].
    ESMA and French regulators said this week that conditions
for allowing foreign financial firms who get access to the
bloc's market directly from London need tightening ahead of
Brexit  [nL8N1WH2Q5].
    ""I hope we don't end up with a world where this is viewed as
an opportunity to close markets and grab business. It will not
end successfully,"" Bailey said.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European Council President
Donald Tusk sharply criticised what he called ""emotional"" and
""insulting"" statements about the EU by British ministers and
urged London on Thursday to accept an offer of very close
post-Brexit ties.
    The European Union was offering Britain a ""Canada plus plus
plus"" arrangement, Tusk told reporters after meeting the Irish
prime minister, explaining Britain could have not just a free
trade accord like that with Canada but also extremely close
relations in security, foreign policy and other areas.
    ""The EU wants a relationship with the UK that is as close
and special as possible,"" Tusk said. ""From the very beginning,
the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada plus
plus plus deal. Much further-reaching on trade, on internal
security and on foreign policy cooperation.""
    Standing beside Irish premier Leo Varadkar and referring to
arguments from British politicians rejecting EU proposals for
keeping Northern Ireland inside EU economic rules, Tusk said:
    ""Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound
attractive but they do not facilitate agreement. Every actor in
this process has their dignity and confrontation in this field
will not lead to anything good.
    ""No one can expect that because of Brexit, the EU will give
up its fundamental values and key interests."" 
    Referring to sharp exchanges on both sides after EU leaders
met British Prime Minister Theresa May at a summit in Salzburg
two weeks ago, he urged her to work to a final accord by the
next summit in Brussels in two weeks.

    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - With just six months to
go until Britain is due to leave the European Union,
negotiations between the sides to agree a divorce settlement and
a blueprint of new relations after Brexit are in the final
stretch.
    If they fail to agree, Britain could face leaving without a
deal, a national election or even another referendum.
    Below are significant dates in the run-up to Britain's
scheduled departure from the EU in March:
    
    IRISH PM IN BRUSSELS - Oct. 4
    Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar holds talks with EU
officials on Thursday, as Britain and the bloc make a new push
to overcome their differences on the post-Brexit Irish border.
    
    BARNIER MEETS N. IRELAND POLITCIANS & EU 27 ENVOYS - Oct. 5 
    EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier meets Northern Irish
politicians but not Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene
Foster who vehemently opposes having different regulations on
her soil to the rest of the United Kingdom. 
    A meeting with Foster is expected next week. 
    Barnier will also brief Brussels ambassadors of the EU 27
states on progress. 
    
    ""OUTLINE OF NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH UK"" - Oct. 10
    Barnier is due to present to the EU's executive European
Commission a first draft of the bloc's proposal for close trade
ties with Britain after Brexit.
        
    EUROPEAN COUNCIL - Oct. 17-18
    May meets fellow EU leaders and the European Commission to
try to seal deals on the terms of Britain's withdrawal and what
kind of relationship it has in the future.
    EU leaders of the 27 states remaining in the bloc will have
a dinner on Wednesday and then hopefully be joined by May on
Thursday to announce enough progress has been made on the Irish
border issue to merit calling an extra EU summit in November to
finalise the deal, including a blueprint of future trade ties.
    
    SPECIAL BREXIT SUMMIT - weekend of Nov. 17-18
    EU leaders are ready to hold a special summit on the weekend
of Nov. 17-18 to seal a Brexit deal with Britain, if agreement
had been reached.
    Markets are expecting a deal in November, and analysts say
sterling would likely fall if the talks slip further.

    EU COUNCIL - Dec. 13-14
    European Union leaders will gather for an EU Council meeting
on Dec 13-14. If a deal is not struck in November, this summit
could be one of the last chances for a deal if parliaments on
both sides are to ratify an agreement by exit day in March.
    
    UK PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON BREXIT DEAL - Unscheduled
    If May secures a deal, she has to get the British parliament
to approve it. She would need about 320 votes in parliament to
get approval.
    Her Conservatives hold 316 seats in the 650-seat lower
house, and she relies on a Northern Irish party to win
parliamentary votes.
    Labour has indicated it would vote against her deal so
unless she can win over her own lawmakers, she could lose a vote
in parliament.
    Failure could trigger a move against her leadership of the
Conservative Party, or the government's collapse and an early
election.
   
    EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RATIFICATION - Unscheduled 
    The European Parliament must also sign off on any agreement
reached between May and the other 27 EU leaders. If the
legislature starts ratification in November or even December, it
should still be able to complete the elaborate process in time
for Brexit day. 
    It could hold a final vote during a plenary session set for
March 11-14. [nL8N1VP3GX] But legislators' minds will also be on
campaigning ahead of European Parliament elections in May - in
which Britain would no longer take part.
    EU officials have suggested a further delay may still be
possible if negotiators are very close to sealing a deal. But it
would just be a few extra weeks at best, as the current EU
parliament holds its last plenary session on April 15-18, 2019.
That is already beyond the current Brexit date.
        
    NO DEAL STATEMENT
    If there is no deal by Jan. 21, 2019, the British government
must make a statement within five days on what it plans to do,
according to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018. 
    May said this week a 'no-deal' Brexit would be better than
the EU's standing offer. [nL8N1WB58N]
    
    BREXIT - March 29, 2019 at 2300 GMT. 
    Britain will formally leave the EU. Providing an exit deal
is agreed, there will be a transition period during which the
bulk of the bloc's rules and regulations continue to apply while
the British government formulates and implements replacement
policies on issues such as immigration.
    
    TRANSITION PERIOD ENDS - Dec. 31, 2020
    The transition period, designed to ease the impact on
businesses and relieve uncertainty, is due to end. Little has
been agreed so far about the new arrangements between Britain
and the EU on trade, customs and other major issues.

up, that can be in itself damaging even if it ends up to be okay

also a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council,
told an Irish parliamentary committee.
    ""Unless there is very rapid and very clear progress within

106,432,583,1280,441c887e53eabaf380d9d327d1341409,UPDATE 1-Hungary challenges EU's posted workers reform in court,2018-10-04 21:41:32,EUR,1.7314599999999998,2018-10-04 21:41:40,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    BUDAPEST, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hungary has challenged a
European Commission reform on posted workers - those who travel
to other EU countries to work on terms set in their home country
- at the European Union court, the government said in a
statement on Thursday.
    Hungary wants the court to annul a directive announced in
July, which extends to the provision of services the principle
of paying equal wages for the same job in the same place. 
    That reform ""does not serve the protection of posted workers
but in fact ... is a tool for protectionism,"" the government
said. 
    Poland and Hungary have led efforts to block the directive,
initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron. 
    Macron wanted to overhaul a system that allows people to
work in other EU countries on contracts that need only guarantee
the host country's minimum wage and that allow taxes and social
charges to be paid in the home nation.
    Macron said the system created unfair competition in
wealthier nations like France and Germany [nL8N1LA3M2].
    Paris complained that central and eastern Europe gains an
unfair advantage from the ""social dumping"" of cheap labour,
arguing that posting low-paid workers hurts local jobs and
erodes labour protections in higher-wage member states.
    Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the
EU workforce, with many employed in haulage and construction,
the issue has widened a divide between the poorer east and rich
west.
    Hungary said on Thursday that the EU directive violated the
freedom of provision of services set out in the bloc's Treaty.
    It said Poland would also challenge the regulation.
    The Polish government was not immediately reachable for
comment.

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Italy is considering reducing tax
benefits for the country's lenders as part of measures to fund
next year's budget, a government source said on Thursday.
    Confirming a report in Il Sole 24 Ore daily, the source said
the government could reduce the amount of interest payments and
writedowns that banks can deduct from their taxable income.
    Italy's anti-establishment government is struggling to
finance a number of expensive electoral promises which it wants
to include in next year's budget.
    If the changes went through, banks would only be able to
deduct 85 percent of interest payments from their tax base and
would have to spread losses stemming from the newly introduced
IFRS9 accounting rule over a period of two to 10 years, Il Sole
reported.
    Giovanni Razzoli, an analyst at broker Equita SIM, said he
expected a muted impact on banks' earnings from the outlined
measures, adding this was already priced in by the market, where
Italian banks trade at a deep discount to the value of their
assets.
    Razzoli estimated a 4 percent hit to earnings and an average
capital erosion of 6 basis points.
    The head of Italian banking association ABI said increasing
the tax pressure on banks risked weakening the economy as
lenders could become less able to support businesses.
    But Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the
populist 5-Star Movement, said it was ""sacrosanct ... to strip
bankers of some of their privileges.""
    ""If a good economic performance hinged on bankers'
privileges, we would be in the Land of Plenty by now given all
the money the sector got from previous governments. Things are
going to change,"" he said in a Facebook post.
    Italy's previous centre-left government passed several
measures to help the banking sector recover after a deep
recession, culminating in the state bailout of the country's
third-largest bank Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> in 2017.
    The 5-Star Movement rode popular anger at a string of bank
failures in recent years that have left thousands of Italian who
held their local lenders' bonds and stocks out of pocket.
    Italian banks are large holders of the country's debt and
have been badly hit by market turmoil over Italian bonds.

    The source also confirmed that the government was
considering scrapping tax incentives introduced by the previous
executive to spur companies' capital levels, known as 'Allowance
for Corporate Equity' or ACE.

    * Quarterly growth seen at +0.5 pct in Q3, +0.4 pct in Q4

    PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - French economic growth is set to
pick up in the second half of the year but will struggle to meet
the government's growth target, the INSEE stats agency forecast
on Thursday.
    The euro zone's second-biggest economy is on course for
growth this year of 1.6 percent as a recovery in household
income helps offsets a slowdown in the first half of the year,
INSEE said in its quarterly outlook. 
    The estimate was marginally less optimistic than the 1.7
percent the government was expecting this year and marks a
slowdown from the 2.3 percent recorded last year.
    INSEE had previously forecast 1.7 percent, and it said
growth could still reach that if households ended up spending
rather than saving extra cash from two tax cuts taking effect in
the second half of the year.
    France eked out quarterly growth of only 0.2 percent in the
first two quarters of the year as strikes curbed activity and a
warm spring kept energy spending low.
    INSEE estimated growth would more than double to 0.5 percent
in the third quarter and come in at 0.4 percent in the final
three months. The tax cuts could push it even higher.  
    Cuts in payroll and housing taxes in the second half of 2018
were expected to increase growth in household disposable income
to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter from 0.5 percent in the
third quarter.
    Slower inflation would also help keep more money in
households' pockets. It is forecast to average 1.9 percent over
the whole of the year after peaking at 2.2 percent in the third
quarter.
    INSEE said that unemployment was expected to keep easing
over the course of the year to stand at 8.9 percent at the end
of December.

    By Giuseppe Fonte and Steve Scherer
    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The Italian government on Thursday
dismissed concerns that the European Commission would reject its
plan to raise deficit spending next year and signalled that it
would not backtrack, even under market pressure.
    After a selloff hit Italian bonds on Tuesday, the government
made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League on Wednesday watered down its original plan to
keep its deficit steady at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2020-21. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But it stuck to its 2.4 percent target for next year, and on
Thursday government officials said they had no plans to make
further revisions to that goal, which is three times more than
one set out by the previous government.
    Speaking about the multi-year budget targets that must be
reviewed by Brussels by mid-month, Deputy Economy Minister
Massimo Garavaglia said on Thursday: ""(Either) it passes or it
doesn't, but this isn't the problem. We're more focused on what
is happening in the markets.""
    Garavaglia also said the government's GDP growth forecast
for next year would be 1.6 percent, much higher than the 1.2
percent median projection of 51 analysts polled by Reuters last
month.
    That goal was later confirmed by Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria in a letter to the European Commission, which called for
""open and constructive dialogue"" over the budget plan.
[nR1N1RB01X]
    Growth was forecast at 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent
in 2021, Tria said.
    The gap between Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields and
their safer German equivalent on Tuesday widened to more than
300 basis points, its widest since May, on concerns about
Italy's plans. On Thursday, the spread had narrowed to 278 basis
points.
    League leader Matteo Salvini, speaking on RAI state radio,
said that next year's deficit spending was needed to spark
growth and create jobs, and added that the government would not
back down even if the spread widened to 400 basis points.
    ""This is a budget that looks to the future, and we will
absolutely not go backwards,"" Salvini said.
    The government's confident tone came as la Repubblica
newspaper reported that the commission had already sent Italian
officials an informal note saying it would reject next year's
spending plans.
    Sources close to economic commissioners in Brussels said the
report was ""unfounded"". The commission must formally give its
opinion on the budget forecasts by the end of the month.
    Separately, deputy prime minister and 5-Star leader Luigi Di
Maio denied an article in Il Fatto Quotidiano saying the
government was seeking a cabinet reshuffle, mainly to replace
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria in December or January.
    Di Maio also seemed unfazed by concern expressed earlier
this week by commissioners and EU allies over the deficit
spending plans.
    ""We have brought home the people's budget, and we're going
to forge ahead more determined than before,"" Di Maio said in an
interview with Radio Radicale. ""Now we can start a serious and
healthy discussion with the European Commission to reach a
positive conclusion.""

within seven-ten days and the economy cannot withstand any more

     Since a parliamentary election in May, political wrangling
has prevented Lebanon from forming a national unity government,
raising concerns in a country with one of the world's highest
rates of public debt.
    ""The economic situation is very difficult...(it) can't bear
political disputes,"" Hariri said in an interview on a prime-time
television show on Thursday night. ""There are solutions, which
(President Michel Aoun) and I have discussed."" 
    In the five months since the May vote, Hariri has expressed
optimism several times about a near breakthrough. [nL8N1WJ4U1]
    Key parties in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system have
jostled over ministries, as foreign donors urged avoiding any
more delay and Lebanese politicians warned of economic crisis.
    A Paris donors conference in April yielded pledges of
billions, conditional on reform that a new government will have
to undertake. 
    Lebanon's last coalition government continued as a caretaker
administration after the May vote, which produced a parliament
tilted in favour of the Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement.

    BELFAST, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The head of the Northern Irish
party that props up Prime Minister Theresa May's government said
on Tuesday a Brexit deal was ""eminently possible"" within weeks,
but she would not accept different regulations from the rest of
the United Kingdom.
    In an interview before a meeting with chief EU Brexit
negotiator Michel Barnier, Foster stuck to her rejection of any
new regulatory or customs barriers between Britain and Northern
Ireland - but said with political will, a deal was possible.
    ""We cannot have the single market of the United Kingdom
interfered with in that way and that is the message we will be
giving to Michel Barnier today. There cannot be any regulatory
barriers between ourselves and the rest of the United Kingdom,""
she said.
    ""I want to see a deal that works for everyone and I think
that is eminently possible if the political will is there to
make it happen,"" Foster told BBC Radio Ulster.
     The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland is the biggest remaining sticking point in Brexit talks
between Britain and the European Union, and both sides are
trying to work out how to monitor and regulate trade over the
frontier.
    EU sources told Reuters on Thursday that EU negotiators see
the outline of a compromise on the Irish border issue, raising
hopes that a new British offer could unlock a deal. [nL8N1WK2J0]

    By Amanda Ferguson and Gabriela Baczynska
    BELFAST/BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A Brexit deal is
""eminently possible"" within weeks but there can be no regulatory
barriers within the United Kingdom, the head of the Northern
Irish party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May
said on Tuesday.
    Less than six months before the UK's exit from the European
Union, there is little clarity about how the world's fifth
largest economy and its preeminent international financial
centre will trade with the EU after Brexit.
    Talks are snagged on how to avoid checks on the border
between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the
sides fail to clinch a post-Brexit free trade deal.
    May and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),
which supports her minority government, have opposed EU
proposals for a backstop that would keep Northern Ireland - but
not mainland Britain - de facto inside the EU economic space.
    Ahead of a meeting with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier
in Brussels, DUP leader Arlene Foster stuck to her rejection of
any new regulatory or customs barriers inside the United Kingdom
- but said that, with political will, a deal was possible.
    ""I want to see a deal that works for everyone and I think
that is eminently possible if the political will is there to
make it happen,"" Foster told BBC Radio Ulster. ""I very much hope
that there is a deal in a number of weeks."" 
    The EU's Brexit negotiators believe a divorce deal with
Britain is ""very close"", diplomatic sources told Reuters last
week, indicating a compromise on the future Irish border was in
play. [nL8N1WL0WQ]
    A flurry of Brexit activity is expected over coming days.
    Barnier will update the Commission on Wednesday and then EU
ambassadors meet on Friday in Luxembourg. EU leaders'
negotiators meet in Brussels on Monday.
    But even if May clinches a deal, there is uncertainty on
whether she could sell it at home, where she will need approval
from the British parliament.
    Lawmaker Steve Baker said at least 40 lawmakers in her
Conservative Party were willing to vote down her possible Brexit
deal if it left the UK 'half in and half out' of the EU.
    
    BLIND BREXIT?
    If lawmakers reject a deal, May could fall and Britain would
face leaving the EU without an agreement, a move investors and
company chiefs say would weaken the West, panic financial
markets and block the arteries of trade.
    The United Kingdom would move from seamless trade with the
EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization
for external states.
    ""Colleagues will not tolerate a half-in, half-out Brexit,""
said Baker, who served as a junior Brexit minister in May's
government until he resigned in protest at her proposals.
    If 40 of her lawmakers voted against a possible deal, the
fate of the government and exit process would depend on the
opposition Labour Party, which has indicated it will vote
against almost any deal May might secure.
    Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term
economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if
cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in
German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare
spending.
    A 'hard' Brexit would result in extra tariffs of more than 3
billion euros ($3.4 billion) for German companies per year, a
German institute said on Tuesday, adding that German exports to
Britain could drop by up to 57 percent. [nL8N1WP1NU]
    Under May's proposals, Britain will seek a free trade area
for goods with the EU, largely by accepting a ""common rulebook""
for goods and British participation in EU agencies that provide
authorisations for goods.
    Some Brexiteers say those proposals would ensure the EU kept
control over swathes of the British economy and thus run counter
to the spirit of her manifesto pledge to leave the EU Customs
Union and the Single Market.

    By Daphne Psaledakis
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union environment
ministers will seek a compromise on Tuesday over how tough to be
on curbing carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans, with
Germany warning too tough targets could harm industry and cost
jobs.
    In a clash between concerns over the environmental risk of
emissions and industry competitiveness, EU governments are
divided over what 2030 limits to impose on Europe's powerful
carmakers.
    Germany, with its big auto sector, has backed the EU
executive proposing a 30 percent reduction by 2030, compared to
2021 levels. [nL8N1WI1K1] [nL8N1WC3PB]
    ""After the IPCC report yesterday that is not easy. But it is
a position we all agreed on,"" German Environment Minister Svenja
Schulze told reporters on her way to the meeting in Luxembourg.
    The meeting comes a day after the release of the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which
warned that societies would have to make ""unprecedented"" changes
to meet a lower global warming target. [nL4N1WO1TL]
    France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are among countries
pushing for a stricter limit of 40 percent, in line with climate
targets backed by EU lawmakers last week. [nL8N1WJ305]
    ""Everyone is calling for action after the report from
climate experts, and we now have a chance to find an agreement
that is the most dynamic possible, the most ambitious possible,""
said French Minister for the Environment, Francois de Rugy.
    
    TOO CLOSE TO CALL
    EU regulators have been galvanised into setting tougher
rules by Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it had
masked exhaust emissions using software in as many as 11 million
diesel vehicles worldwide.[nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    In response to a recent EU study that showed carmakers
cheating new pollution checks, the bloc's lawmakers added an
amendment requiring figures to be verified against on-road
tests. [nL5N1UL2JU] 
    Under the plan, carmakers would be able to lower their CO2
targets by meeting a benchmark for the sale of zero- and
low-emission vehicles as a share of their total new car sales.
[nL8N1WJ305]
    Pushing to reach an agreement among the bloc's 28 nations at
the Luxembourg meeting on Tuesday, Austria, which holds the EU's
rotating presidency, has proposed a compromise of 35 percent
reduction in emissions by 2030.
    ""It's too close to call,"" said Greg Archer, an expert with
Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. 
    If they reach an agreement, negotiations on the final law
could begin with the EU's two other lawmaking bodies as early as
Wednesday.
    EU sources said that more-populated Germany, with the
backing of eastern European nations, may have the votes needed
for a majority at the meeting.
    The limits in the transport sector - the only one in which
emissions are still rising - aim to help the bloc meet its
overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030.

quota
    * Australia, Uruguay, others largely now filling quota

    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union countries are on
the verge of agreeing to start negotiations with the United
States to allow more U.S. beef into Europe, in what could be a
major move to defuse transatlantic trade tensions.
    The European Commission sought approval from its 28 member
states at the start of September to open negotiations with
Washington. 
    Trade experts have already given their backing, ambassadors
will provide clearance on Wednesday and the approval process is
set to be completed next week, EU diplomats say.
    The beef issue is officially separate from a pact reached by
U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission chief
Jean-Claude Juncker in July to try and ease trade tensions.
Trump has pledged to reduce the United States' $151 billion
goods trade deficit with the European Union. 
    However, a deal to increase U.S. meat imports would affect
the trade balance, as well as placating the Trump base of U.S.
farmers and rural communities which have been hit by the
tit-for-tat trade war with China.
    EU diplomats say the European Commission, which negotiates
on behalf of the 28 EU countries, would look to raise the U.S.
share of hormone-free beef imports into Europe, but would need
to convince other countries considered to be ""substantial""
suppliers to accept less.
    A negotiated agreement on beef would settle a dispute that
dates back to 1981 when the European Union banned the use of
growth hormones in meat across the bloc, including imports. 
    The EU and the United States eventually concluded an
agreement in 2009 to grant a quota for hormone-free beef
imports, which currently stands at 45,000 tonnes. However, under
World Trade Organization rules, the quota also had to be made
available to non-U.S. suppliers.
    
    ""LESS OR NOTHING""
    The U.S. share of that quota has slipped from nearly 100
percent at the start to less than 30 percent in the year to the
end of June, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation
(USMEF).
    Australia and Uruguay, and more recently Argentina, have
steadily increased their shares.
    EU diplomats say the European Commission would look to raise
the U.S. share of the quota to at least 40 or 50 percent.
    While other countries considered to be ""substantial""
suppliers would have to accept less, that may mean Brussels only
needs to get backing from Australia and Uruguay, with
Argentina's share just below 10 percent.
    USMEF economist Erin Borror said that quarterly quota
allocations were typically filled within two weeks, so U.S. beef
could only enter Europe duty-free for a few days. 
    ""Depending upon what agreement is reached, we foresee demand
in Europe (for U.S. beef) being strong enough to easily double
that value from the $200 million mark to $400 million,"" she
said.
    EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has said a settlement
on beef would ease overall trade tensions across the Atlantic.
    The EU's argument to other big beef exporters to Europe is
likely to be that the entire quota could go if there is no deal
with the United States.
    ""It can be put to them as either less or nothing,"" one EU
diplomat said.

    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
rose to new highs on Tuesday after Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria's address to parliament on the government's budget plans
did little to reassure nervous investors. 
    Tria called for a constructive discussion with Brussels over
the budget and said he did not think Italy's deficit forecasts
were so shocking. The EU Commission Vice-President Jyrki
Katainen said Italy's situation is very vulnerable, and
negotiations may prove very difficult. [nR1N1VZ01H] [nR1N1VZ01J]
    As a war of war of words between Rome and the European Union
over Italy's spending plans has ratcheted up in recent days,
Italian bonds, stocks and the euro have taken a fresh hit.
    ""Maybe some people were expecting some reassurance from
Tria, but he's not calling the shots,"" said Jan von Gerich,
chief analyst at Nordea. ""The general background is that the
budget continues to cause uncertainty.""    
    Italy's 30-year bond yield rose above 4 percent for the
first time since August 2014, and was last up five basis points
on the day <IT30YT=RR>.
    Five-year Italian bond yields rose to 3.13 percent
<IT5YT=RR>, their highest level in almost five years, while
10-year bond yields jumped over 10 bps to a new 4-1/2 year high
at 3.71 percent <IT10YT=RR>. 
    This pushed the premium investors demand for holding Italian
10-year bonds over top-rated Germany <DE10YT=RR> to its widest
point in five years at around 312 basis points.
    Analysts said talk of a report that the European Commission
was likely to reject Italian budget plans was putting pressure
on Italian bonds. 
    The European Commission is not due to express a first
opinion on the Italian budget until November.
    It has told Italy it is concerned about the budget deficit
plans for the next three years since they breach what the EU
asked Rome to do in July.
    ""Instability and uncertainty is here to stay,"" said one
Milan-based rates strategist who asked not to be named.
    ""There is a power struggle between the government, EU
institutions and financial markets and we are nowhere near the
end of the confrontation.""
    Italy's bond market had shown some signs of stabilising
early on Tuesday on hopes that Tria would strike a more
conciliatory tone in parliament.
    The euro has also taken a hit from concerns about tension
between the EU and Italy, languishing near a seven-week low
<EUR=>.
    ""At the moment investors are puzzled because it is so
uncertain where this is going to end, that spread could really
go anywhere,"" said a senior banker at one of Italy's primary
dealers - banks appointed by governments to buy bonds at
government auctions. He preferred to remain unnamed as he is not
authorised to speak about his clients. 
    Spanish and Portuguese bond yields rose to their highest
levels since May and June respectively <ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR>,
but those markets have not seen heavy selling - suggesting that
contagion from Italy remains limited.
    In fact, most bond yields in the bloc were a touch higher -
feeling the pull of a rise in U.S. Treasury yields to fresh
multi-year highs on Tuesday. [nL4N1WP1E1]
    U.S. Treasury yields have been rising on the back of a
strengthening economy and on expectations the Federal Reserve
will continue to hike rates as a result.
    German and French 10-year yields rose one to two basis
points each at 0.55 percent and 0.90 percent respectively.

    By Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The leader of Northern Ireland's
biggest party on Tuesday ruled out any checks on trade with the
British mainland after the EU's Brexit negotiator tried to
persuade her that such controls could be ""de-dramatised"".
    Arlene Foster, whose Democratic Unionist Party props up
Prime Minister Theresa May's government in London, said the DUP
would never accept the regulatory or customs controls that the
EU's Michel Barnier says are an essential ""backstop"" to avoid a
hard land border with EU member Ireland after Britain leaves.
    ""There is only one red line,"" Foster told reporters after
her meeting with Barnier in Brussels, as he presses to secure a
deal on the Irish border issue that can unlock a withdrawal
accord with London in time for a summit next Wednesday.
    ""We could not support any arrangement which could give rise
to either customs or regulatory barriers within the UK internal
market,"" Foster said, adding that she looked forward to further
meetings in Brussels over the coming two days.
    Barnier tweeted after their meeting that he was ""working
hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop"" -- a text by
which the EU proposes keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU
economic space in the event that a future EU-UK free trade deal
fails to find a way to avoid disruptive checks on their land
frontier.
    EU negotiators have floated ideas about making customs and
regulatory checks on goods by discreet technical means well away
from sea transit routes between Britain's mainland and its Irish
province to try to overcome objections from Foster -- and May --
that such differences undermine the United Kingdom's integrity.
    Asked about that push to ""de-dramatise"" checks if the
backstop were triggered, Foster said: ""The whole point of checks
is there's a difference. Why would we need checks ... if we were
an integral part of the single market of the United Kingdom?""
    She said she had yet to see new proposals that May plans to
put to Barnier in a bid to address the problem.
    Pressed on whether the DUP was prepared to block a Brexit
deal and so pitch Britain into a ""no-deal"" scenario next March,
Foster said she believed her party was not alone in its view,
and that she expected May to respect its position.

    FLORENCE, Italy, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte said on Tuesday the International Monetary Fund's
forecasts for the Italian economy should be revised in light of
the government's 2019 budget proposals. 
    ""The (IMF) forecasts should be updated in respect of our
budget plan. We have shown (the figures) ... and the deficit/GDP
ratio in the third year will fall under 2 percent ... the same
works for debt/GDP, which we will contain, and will fall,"" Conte
said.
    In the World Economic Outlook published on Tuesday the IMF 
forecast Italian GDP growth would fall to 1 percent in 2019 from
1.5 percent this year, with the deficit/GDP ration stabilising
at 1.7 percent.
    The IMF said that the slowdown in Italian growth was due to
the ""deep deterioration of foreign and domestic demand, combined
with the political uncertainty on the agenda of the new
government"".
    Italy's populist coalition government, made up of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League
party, is targeting GDP growth of 1.5 percent, using tax cuts
and welfare spending that would increase the deficit to 2.4
percent next year.
    The budget plans run counter to what the European Union
asked Italy to do in July, but Rome insisted on Tuesday it would
""not retreat"" from its spending plans [nR1N1VZ01A].

 (Adds European Commission reaction, industry comment)
    By Huw Jones and William Schomberg
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of England urged the
European Union on Tuesday to do more to protect cross-border
financial services from the risks of a ""cliff-edge Brexit"",
saying the need for action was now pressing.
    Less than six months before Britain is due to leave the EU,
creating the potential for new barriers for companies doing
business across the English Channel, the BoE said in its
strongest warning so far that it saw risks for insurance,
derivatives and the transfer of data.
    London and Brussels have yet to agree the terms of Britain's
departure from the bloc and their new relationship, a deal that
would mean business as usual until the end of 2020.
    ""There has been considerable progress in the UK to address
these risks, but only limited progress in the EU,"" the central
bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said in a statement
published on Tuesday after a meeting on Oct. 3.
    ""In the limited time remaining, it is not possible for
companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption
to cross-border financial services. The need for authorities to
complete mitigating actions is now pressing.""
    Bankers say Brussels wants to pile pressure on banks,
insurers and fund managers in London to open up new hubs in
rival EU financial centres such as Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin.
    The European Commission said on Tuesday it has consistently
encouraged all stakeholders in financial services to prepare for
Brexit, and that it continued to analyse with the European
Central Bank possible risks for markets.
    The EU executive will review the situation after an EU
summit next week that seeks to finalise Britain's exit deal and
transition period, a Commission spokesman said.
    The industry is also waiting to see what steps if any a
joint BoE and ECB working group will take to keep markets
orderly around Brexit Day.
        
    NO TIME
    Derivatives with a nominal value of 41 trillion pounds would
face legal uncertainty if the EU took no action in the event of
a no-deal Brexit, the BoE said.
    On insurance, even if companies based in Britain complete
planned moves of their European business to the EU before March,
around 9 million policyholders in the bloc would still be under
the shadow of uncertainty after March, it said.
    Britain is approving a law that would temporarily allow EU
financial firms to continue doing business here in the event of
a no-deal Brexit and wants the EU to do likewise, but Brussels
has so far refused.
    ""Financial stability should not be jeopardised in a game of
high-stakes political poker,"" said Catherine McGuinness,
political leader of the City of London financial district.
    LCH in London, which clears most euro-denominated interest
rate swaps, faces having to force EU-based members to shift
their contracts to rivals in the bloc, a costly undertaking.
    LCH had no immediate comment.
    The FPC also said it was keeping its capital buffer rate for
banks unchanged, noting restraint among borrowers, although it
said it was concerned by fast growth in lending to riskier,
highly indebted companies.
    Banks generally hold enough core capital to cope with a
disorderly Brexit, it said.
    Britain's banks are required to meet a so-called
countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) of 1 percent of their
risk-weighted assets as part of BoE efforts to avoid a repeat of
the taxpayer bailouts after the global financial crisis.
    The FPC said it would review the CCyB level at its next
meeting on Nov. 28.

    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - If British Prime Minister Theresa
May is able to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union in
the coming weeks, she will face a crucial vote in parliament
when she asks lawmakers to approve it.
    How will the vote in parliament work?
   
    WHAT DOES MAY HAVE TO DO? 
    - If a deal has been agreed, May has to present to
parliament:
    1) A statement saying political agreement has been reached
    2) The negotiated withdrawal agreement
    3) The framework for the future relationship with the EU
    - Ministers must also arrange a debate on the deal. In the
directly elected lower house of parliament this will conclude
with a vote on a motion stating that parliament has approved the
deal. This is the big vote.
    - Opponents of May's strategy are likely to try to put
forward amendments to the government motion, which could be put
to a separate vote. These could include changing the wording to
make acceptance of the deal conditional upon it being approved
by a referendum.
    If any of these amendments pass, it would be considered a
defeat for the government. Although not legally binding, they
would be hard to ignore.
    The order of votes - whether amendments are voted upon
before the government motion, or vice versa - will be determined
closer to the time.
    - The unelected upper house of parliament, the House of
Lords, will also debate the deal, but will only be asked to
""take note"" of it. The Lords will not get a straight ""approve""
or ""reject"" vote, and will not have the power to block the deal.
    - The legislation defining the procedure for parliamentary
approval does not specify how quickly after a deal is announced
the vote will happen. It only stipulates that ministers should
try to hold it before the European Parliament has its own vote. 
        
    WHAT WILL LAWMAKERS VOTE ON?
    Lawmakers will be voting on whether to approve a package
consisting of:
    1) The withdrawal agreement - a legal text setting out
issues such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, a
backstop for the Irish border, and the terms of an
implementation period designed to smooth the exit process.
    2) The future relationship framework - a non-legal document
defining how Britain and the EU will work together in the long
term on issues such as trade and security. 
    These two documents define the deal May and her team have
been negotiating with the European Commission since June 2017.
    
    WHO GETS TO VOTE?
    There are 650 elected lawmakers in Britain's House of
Commons. Excluding non-voting members such as the speaker and
others who never take up their seats, around 320 votes are
needed to be certain of winning a vote. The actual number needed
for victory depends on abstentions and absences on the day.
    The vote is decided by a simple majority. Whichever side has
more votes wins.    
    
    HOW WILL THE RESULT BE ANNOUNCED?
    At the end of the debate, the speaker will typically ask for
those in favour of the motion to shout ""aye"", and then those
against to say ""no"". As long as some lawmakers shout ""no"", the
speaker will call for a formal vote, known as a division.
    Votes are registered by lawmakers walking through different
doorways, out of sight of television cameras and onlookers. Once
the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minutes -
lawmakers return to the debating chamber.
    Four appointed tellers will assemble in front of the
speaker, and one will read the result out loud. 
       
    HOW WILL THE PARTIES VOTE?
    The ruling Conservative Party has 315 lawmakers. It governs
with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10
lawmakers of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    But May's party is not united behind her current plan.
Eurosceptics think it leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, and
pro-EU lawmakers say the ties are not close enough. Both groups
are potentially large enough to inflict defeat.
    The support of the 10 DUP lawmakers is dependent on the
solution agreed on the Irish border. They have said they will
not support any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to
different rules to the rest of the country.
    The opposition Labour Party has 257 lawmakers. Led by Jeremy
Corbyn, the party has pledged to vote down any deal that does
not meet its criteria. The plans currently under discussion are
unlikely to do this, so most Labour lawmakers can be expected to
vote against May.
    However, some who disagree with Corbyn's stance could rebel
and vote with the government in order to avoid the risk of
leaving without a deal. Media reports have said May is courting
these Labour ""moderates"".
    The Scottish National Party's 35 lawmakers are expected to
vote against the government deal, as are the 12 Liberal
Democrats.
        
    IF MAY WINS, IS THAT IT?
    No. Although the vote is the focal point for resistance to
the deal, the government is also required to pass separate
legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement and complete
the ratification process.
    This legislation will be known as the EU (Withdrawal
Agreement) Bill. It will be subject to full scrutiny in
parliament, involving multiple rounds of possible amending and
voting. It has to be passed before March 29, 2019.
    This process is unlikely to be used to unpick the deal as
the legislation will be implementing what has already been
approved by parliament. However, if parliament feels as if May
has ignored its wishes and is forcing the deal through, it could
use the bill to stall the exit process.
    
    WHAT IF MAY LOSES?
    This would be a politically explosive outcome that could
topple May and her government. There are legislative guidelines
on what happens next, but they could be overtaken by events.
    By law, if the government motion is rejected, ministers have
21 days to set out in a statement how they intend to proceed.
The government has said that if their deal is rejected, Britain
will leave the EU without a deal.
    It then has to call a fresh debate in parliament that could
give lawmakers another chance to set out amendments -
effectively giving parliament a vote on an alternative path.
These amendments would not be binding, but if approved May would
again find them hard to ignore.

    By Edward Taylor
    FRANKFURT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - German auto parts supplier
Bosch [ROBG.UL] is launching an electric van-sharing service in
Germany, expanding its reach in rentals and pitting it against
some of its customers who are also expanding into pay-per-minute
mobility services.
    Bosch said on Tuesday it will team up with toom, part of
German retailer REWE, to supply battery-driven vans which people
can hire to transport bulky purchases from hardware stores. 
    German cities are banning older diesel vehicles, hastening
the switch to electric and benefiting firms like Bosch, which 
supplies components to electric vehicle makers.
    Combined with the emergence of smartphone-hailed rental
technology, which allows people to use vehicles by the minute
without owning them, this is turning the relationship between
car manufacturers and their suppliers on its head.
    ""A service for sharing electric vans has huge potential for
growth,"" Rainer Kallenbach, president of the Connected Mobility
Solutions division at Bosch said in a statement.
    The Bosch electric vans will be supplied by StreetScooter, a
German startup carmaker owned by logistics company Deutsche Post
<DPWGn.DE>, which uses powertrain components supplied by Bosch.
    StreetScooter on Tuesday unveiled a separate alliance with
Ford <F.N> to build larger electric delivery vans for logistics
company DHL.[L8N1WP4DL]
    
    SELF-DRIVING 
    The market for electric delivery vans is expected to grow
after Germany's highest court in February allowed cities to ban
older diesel vehicles and after Berlin on Tuesday was forced to
consider imposing bans to improve air quality.[nL8N1QH2L1]
    EU lawmakers last week backed a plan to cut carbon dioxide
emissions from cars and vans by an ambitious 40 percent by 2030,
a target which the car industry, already struggling to meet
emissions standards, said is completely unrealistic.[nL8N1WJ305]
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Europe's largest carmaker by sales,
and a large maker of diesel vehicles on Tuesday revealed that
Europe sales had fallen 42.6 percent as it struggles to adapt
engines to new clear air standards.[nL8N1WP3U5][nW8N13100M]
    Opel said it would discontinue its Adam, KARL and Cascada
models in 2019 to help the carmaker meet emissions rules.
    Stuttgart-based Bosch said that if the electric van sharing
service proves popular, its plans to expand it to other partners
including supermarkets and furniture stores.
    The toom alliance marks a further step into on-demand
vehicle rental services for Bosch, which already runs Coup, an
electric scooter rental service, in Paris, Berlin and Madrid.
    Bosch has shied away from competing against traditional
automakers in areas like vehicle manufacturing, fearing it could
alienate components and systems clients like VW and Ford.
    But with new rivals like software company alphabet <GOOGL.O>
developing fully fledged self-driving vehicles, auto suppliers
and carmakers are ramping up efforts to understand
smartphone-based mobility as a prelude to managing fleets of
robotaxis.
    Self-driving cars will allow carmakers and software
companies to offer ride-hailing without having to pay drivers.  
 
    Bosch is already collaborating with Mercedes-Benz parent
Daimler <DAIGn.DE> to develop self-driving cars. [nL1N1U61BN]

    * Comes after labour reform, corporate tax cuts

    PARIS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - French lawmakers gave their backing
in a first reading on Tuesday to an overhaul of corporate law
aimed at cutting red tape for companies and setting several
privatisations in motion.
    The legislation is part of President Emmanuel Macron's
pro-business reform drive that has already eased labour laws and
cut taxes on companies and entrepreneurs.    
    The law aims to make it faster and cheaper to register and
wind down companies while also simplifying a complex system that
imposes new regulations in multiple stages as firms increase
their workforce.
    It includes incentives to make profit-sharing more common
among small firms and encourage employees' voluntary
contributions to all types of savings products.
    The bill also sets the stage for several large
privatisations already flagged by the government, with the
proceeds due to finance a new 10 billion euros ($11.49
billion)innovation fund.
    It will in particular lift legal restraints on selling down
stakes in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA> while allowing the national lottery FDJ to be
privatised. [nFWN1WM03X]
    Some 361 lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted in
favour of the law while 84 were against and 103 abstained from
voting. 
    The bill now goes before the Senate for consideration in
January before returning to the lower house for a final vote.

    By Elizabeth Piper and Gabriela Baczynska
    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Brexit minister Dominic
Raab voiced confidence on Tuesday that Britain and the European
Union would make progress on their divorce at a summit next
week, but again asked the bloc to meet London ""halfway"" on the
most difficult areas.
    Brexit negotiations have stepped up before the summit next
Wednesday and Thursday, and the EU has signalled that its
officials believe a deal is within grasp. But one of the most
difficult obstacles to securing the so-called withdrawal
agreement, the Irish border, has yet to be resolved.
    With just six months before Britain leaves the EU in its
biggest shift in trade and foreign policy in more than 40 years,
both sides say they are intensifying talks to try to avoid a ""no
deal"" Brexit that could harm the world's fifth largest economy.
    ""The October council next week of course will be an
important milestone - we expect that to be a moment where we
will make some progress,"" Raab told parliament when asked why he
was no longer suggesting there could be a deal at the meeting.
    ""The negotiations were always bound to be tough in the final
stretch. That's all the more reason why we should hold our
nerve, stay resolute and focused, and I remain confident we will
reach a deal this autumn.""
    Britain is keen to move forward on a future relationship,
especially after Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals, already
in doubt among many of her governing Conservatives, were widely
criticised at an EU summit in Austria last month.
    At his latest appearance in parliament, where divisions over
how to leave the EU were on display, Raab moved to downplay one
of the thorniest parts of the talks - a so-called backstop
arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border between the
British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
    He again said that a future partnership that ensured
frictionless trade would mean there would be no need for such a
backstop, which would only be used if there was no agreement, or
if the two sides were not ready to put that deal, in place.
    ""We want to pursue the frictionless trade with the EU that
we have now, and that's what our proposal will deliver. But of
course it requires the EU to meet us half way,"" Raab said.
        
    ""RED LINE""
    How to prevent the return of a hard border, which some say
could reignite sectarian divisions on the island of Ireland, has
become one of the hardest hurdles to clear for both sides.
    The small Northern Irish party which props up May's
government again drew what it described as the ""only one red
line"" in its talks in Brussels on Tuesday, ruling out any checks
on trade with the British mainland after Brexit. [nL8N1WP2QS]
    ""We could not support any arrangement which could give rise
to either customs or regulatory barriers within the UK internal
market,"" Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
said after meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
    In parliament, her deputy Nigel Dodds rammed the point home,
warning Raab not to ""repeat that mistake"" from December - when
the DUP almost pulled the rug out from an interim accord
negotiated by May by scuppering a proposal that would have seen
regulatory alignment between the EU and the
province.[nL8N1O42P5]
    Raab reiterated that the government would not do anything to
compromise the integrity of the United Kingdom, adding that
officials had long cautioned that any deal could be pushed back
to a special meeting in November. 
    But one EU diplomat was upbeat, saying the divorce deal, or
withdrawal agreement, could be concluded by Monday and that
officials were working on a proposal to avoid Britain having to
come up with a separate backstop plan as a possible solution.
    For now, the ""intense"" negotiations are ongoing.[nL9N1S905H]

recommended the reallocation on Tuesday of 3 billion euros of
the country's 8.5 billion euro sovereign wealth fund away from
its initial broad investment strategy to government priority
areas. 
    The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) was established
in 2014 from the cash left in the country's pension reserve fund
following the financial crash to invest on a commercial basis in
supporting economic activity and employment in Ireland.
    The government said in July it would refocus the fund to
meet the needs of an economy that had since grown rapidly.
    In a review published on Tuesday, the finance department
said the reallocation of ISIF's excess capacity would allow
government to set up a 'rainy day fund' and ease infrastructure
constraints. [nL8N1U151E]
    Dublin had previously announced that the rainy day fund - a
new contingency reserve - would be initiated with 1.5 billion
euros from ISIF but the the finance department detailed on
Tuesday how the other 1.5 billion could be put into a dedicated
side-portfolio to target strategic infrastructure projects.
    This side-portfolio would allow ISIF to undertake a higher
level of risk as it would not need to be diversified like the
remainder of its portfolio and could fund investments that would
not impact the government's budgetary position, the review said.
    The specific strategic infrastructure sectors should be
determined by government as part of the budgetary process, it
added.
    ISIF had identified the potential reallocation of up to 2
billion euros of its resources, the review said. 
    The finance department identified the higher figure taking
account of dividends paid to the fund by majority state-owned
Allied Irish Banks <AIBG.I> and funding for the state's water
utility which will be replaced with sovereign debt funding.

    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The leaders of Italy's ruling
parties said on Tuesday they would permit no change to the
government's 2019 budget plan, despite financial market pressure
and criticism from the country's central bank and the
parliamentary fiscal watchdog.
    Speaking jointly to reporters, Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi
Di Maio and Matteo Salvini reiterated they would not change the
target of a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product for next year.
    That was three times the forecast of the previous
centre-left administration and sparked criticism from the
European Commission and a rise in yields on Italian government
bonds.
    Backtracking on the budget would mean ""betraying the
Italians"", said Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement.
    Salvini, who leads the right-wing League, said he was
convinced the expansionary budget would yield economic growth of
2 percent next year, rather than the 1.5 percent official
forecast the government set this month.
    Italy's fiscal watchdog, the parliamentary budget office
(UPB), earlier on Tuesday refused to validate the government's
multi-year budget plan, saying its forecasts for economic growth
were too optimistic.
    The planning document projected growth targets of 1.5
percent next year, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
    The government can ignore the UPB's verdict, but if it does
so parliament can call on the economy minister to explain why.
    The Bank of Italy warned on Tuesday that lowering the
retirement age, as the government plans, could put the
sustainability of the pension system at risk.
    Di Maio shot back that the 2011 reform that hiked the
retirement age, approved by a technocratic government, had ""not
been voted for by anybody,"" and those who want to maintain it
should have the courage to run for government.
    Salvini said the people and institutions now criticising the
government's plans were those who had ""brought Italy to
disaster"".
    Shortly before Di Maio and Salvini spoke, Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte said on Facebook the government would not change
its fiscal targets but ""strengthen"" the budget by beefing up
plans for investment.
    Conte, who is close to 5-Star but not a member of either
ruling party, said he would hold a meeting on Wednesday with
state-owned companies to begin putting together a National
Investment Plan.

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Union no longer
expects a new proposal from Britain for the Ireland-UK border
fix after Brexit and negotiators from both sides are seeking to
narrow differences together in direct talks, diplomatic sources
in Brussels said. 
    That marks a small step forward in the Brexit talks as the
27 states who will remain in the bloc have previously insisted
that London present formal new proposals for the border in
writing.
    Brexit negotiators from both sides - Sabine Weyand for the
EU and Oliver Robbins for Britain - have been locked in Brussels
this week in what one diplomat described as ""tunnel
negotiations"" to narrow down the outstanding differences. 
    The issue of how to preserve an open border between EU state
Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland - Britain's
only land frontier - after Brexit is the last remaining hurdle,
with nearly everything else in the withdrawal agreement agreed
before Britain leaves next March. 
    The 27 EU states will hear on progress at a meeting of 
national ambassadors, without Britain, on Friday evening. The
sides are expected to continue intense negotiations through the
weekend with hopes for a breakthrough as early as Monday. 
    The 27 EU leaders meeting next Wednesday in Brussels want to
be able to announce ""decisive progress"" on the Brexit deal to
agree to hold another summit in November. That would be to
finalise work on a declaration of close future ties with Britain
that would also be part of the Brexit package.
    Both the EU and Britain have signalled progress in recent
days, boosting the sentiment on the market, which fears the most
damaging no-deal Brexit.
    ""My feeling is that there is a smaller probability for lack
of deal now than we have had for some time,"" Danuta Hubner, a
European Parliament lawmaker dealing with Brexit, told a
committee.

the ceiling on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) Greek banks
draw from the domestic central bank by 200 million euros to 5.0
billion euros ($5.74 billion), the Bank of Greece said on
Wednesday.
    The move reflected improved liquidity conditions, taking
into account private sector deposit flows and banks' access to
financial markets, it said. The ELA ceiling is valid through to
Nov 7.
    Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) since February 2015 after being cut off from the ECB's
funding window. Emergency funding is more costly than borrowing
directly from the ECB.
    In June 2016 the ECB reinstated Greek banks' access to its
cheap funding operations, allowing lenders to reduce their
dependence on the emergency liquidity lifeline.
    But with Athens out of its bailout programe since August 21
this year, the ECB has ended a waiver that made Greek government
bonds eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Programmes run by some European
Union countries to sell passports and residency permits to
wealthy foreign citizens pose risks of money laundering as some
of the schemes are not properly managed, campaign groups said on
Wednesday.
    Government schemes to trade citizenship or residence rights
for large investment are currently applied in 13 EU countries:
Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Greece, Latvia, Portugal,
Spain, Ireland, Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and France.
Hungary has terminated its programme.
    ""If you have a lot of money that you acquired through
dubious means, securing a new place to call home far away from
the place you stole from isn't just appealing, it's sensible,""
Naomi Hirst of rights group Global Witness said.
    She said checks on individuals that bought EU citizenship or
residency permits were not satisfactory and exposed countries to
corruption and money laundering risks.
    The joint report by Global Witness and Transparency
International urged the European Union to set standards for
managing the schemes and to extend anti-money laundering rules,
applied so far to banks or gaming firms, to all those involved
in the visa-for-sale industry.
    The European Commission is expected to publish a report on
schemes in EU countries by December, an EU official said.
    Acquiring these documents costs on average 900,000 euros,
but Cyprus' passport could cost up to 2 millions, the report
said. 
    Cyprus has raised 4.8 billion euros ($5.51 billion) from its
scheme, while Portugal could earn nearly a billion euros a year,
according to figures cited in the report, called ""European
Getaway – Inside the Murky World of Golden Visas"".
    EU states generated around 25 billion euros in foreign
direct investment in a decade from selling at least 6,000
passports and nearly 100,000 residency permits, the report said
using what it called conservative estimates.
    The report said in Malta, which has raised 718 million euros
from its scheme, applicants who have criminal records or are
under investigation could still be considered eligible ""in
special circumstances"". 
    ""Poorly managed schemes allow corrupt individuals to work
and travel unhindered throughout the EU and undermine our
collective security,"" Laure Brillaud, anti-money laundering
expert at Transparency International, said.
    All the countries who run these schemes, except Britain,
Ireland and Bulgaria, are part of the Schengen free-movement
area which comprises 26 European states.

    * Bond deal follows budget that showed strong fiscal picture

 (Adds details, analyst quote)
    DUBLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Ireland moved on Wednesday to
sell a new 12-year ""green bond"" in its first foray into an
increasingly popular category of securities that a source said
would likely raise between 2 and 3 billion euros.
    It joins a small number of EU countries including France,
Belgium and Poland in entering a market that earmarks proceeds
for use in financing specific environmentally friendly projects
or initiatives that mitigate the impact of climate change.
    The bond will be priced and issued later on Wednesday, banks
and brokers mandated by the country's debt agency to manage the
deal said.
    Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall
bond market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and
companies look to tap the appetite for climate-friendly
investments.
    The issue comes a day after Ireland set its budget for 2019,
which aims to balance the state's books for the first time in
more than a decade and showed the national debt would continue
to fall as a percentage of national income. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    ""The timing and the fiscal backdrop could hardly be better
for the Irish DMO (debt management office). Yesterday's budget
highlighted the current strength of Ireland's economic/fiscal
position,"" said Ryan McGrath, head of fixed income strategy and
sales at Cantor Fitzgerald.
    The reference to the green bond in Finance Minister Paschal
Donohoe's budget speech was also important, McGrath said, as
cross government departmental support is needed for successful
green bond issuance.
    Government representatives joined the country's debt agency
in roadshows held around Europe to brief investors, a source
told Reuters last week. [nL8N1WH5UO]
    The sale also allows the debt agency to meet a long stated
aim of diversifying away from standard bonds and will see it
pass its minimum funding needs for the year, having so far
raised 13.5 billion euros of a 14 to 18 billion euro target.
    Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Danske Bank, HSBC and J.P.
Morgan are joint lead managers for the deal.

agreed on Wednesday to distribute 6.85 billion euros ($7.87
billion) to its regions next year to help them cover the costs
of housing and integrating migrants, a government source told
Reuters.
    Germany is trying to integrate over a million migrants and
refugees who entered in 2015-2016 after Chancellor Angela Merkel
opened its borders, an unpopular decision that catapulted the
anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the lower
house of parliament after elections last year.
    Merkel's government acted ahead of Sunday's election in the
affluent state of Bavaria, where a backlash over migration is
threatening the longtime hold on power of the conservative
Christian Social Union (CSU), Merkel's federal coalition ally.
    Legislation drafted by Merkel's Finance Ministry for migrant
aid to federal states in 2019 includes 2.44 billion euros for
integration including German-language classes, 1.8 billion euros
for accommodation benefits and 500 million for social housing
subsidies, the source said. 
    It provides for a total 15 billion euros to be paid out to
states and communes for assisting migrants through 2022.
    Germany's states also received one-off federal cash
infusions to cover migration-related costs during the height of
the influx by mainly Muslim migrants in 2015 and 2016.

    By Teis Jensen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Danish and Estonian
regulators have not sought assistance from Moscow in their
investigation of a massive money laundering scandal involving
Russian and other account holders, Russia's financial monitoring
service told Reuters on Wednesday.
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
transactions processed by Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the Danish
lender said last month it thinks are suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    ""As of today, we have not received any official request from
Estonian or Danish law enforcement agencies or financial
intelligence units (for) assistance within the existing
international agreements and obligations,"" Rosfinmonitoring said
in an email reply to questions from Reuters.
    Some 23 percent of the incoming funds in the Estonian
non-resident portfolio, the centre of the scandal, came from
Russia, Danske Bank said in its report last month.
    ""It is really criticisable that the Danish authorities did
not reach out to the Russians. It would have been very relevant
to ask them, to find out: where does the money come from,"" Jakob
Dedenroth Bernhoft, a Copenhagen-based expert on anti money
laundering, told Reuters.
    Rosfinmonitoring is unconditionally ready to assist ""in
counteracting laundering of the proceeds of crimes, provided we
receive such requests via the official channels,"" the watchdog
said in its email.
    It also said Russian authorities as far back as 2007
notified the Estonian authorities about the Danske Bank branch's
""improper behavior and its involvement in suspicious transit
operations"".
    Danske Bank's report concluded the bank had failed to take
proper action in 2007 when it was criticised by the Estonian
regulator. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov, in a written answer
to a question from another lawmaker, said on Wednesday the
country's finance watchdog had put too much trust in information
provided by Danske Bank and should have been more critical. 
    Jarlov will be quizzed at an open hearing in the Danish
parliament on Wednesday.
    Denmark's financial services authority did not immediately
reply to a request for comment.

    * Campaigners urge extension of anti-money laundering rules

 (Recasts with Commission, MEP reaction)
    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on
Wednesday it will provide guidance to EU states on how to manage
national schemes to sell passports and residency permits to
wealthy foreign citizens, as campaigners and lawmakers warned of
money laundering risks.
    Government schemes to trade citizenship or residence rights
for large investment are currently applied in 13 EU countries:
Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Greece, Latvia, Portugal,
Spain, Ireland, Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and France.
Hungary has terminated its programme.
    ""If you have a lot of money that you acquired through
dubious means, securing a new place to call home far away from
the place you stole from isn't just appealing, it's sensible,""
Naomi Hirst of rights group Global Witness said.
    She said checks on individuals that bought EU citizenship or
residency permits were not satisfactory and exposed countries to
corruption and money laundering risks.
    The joint report by Global Witness and Transparency
International urged the European Union to set standards for
managing the schemes and to extend anti-money laundering rules,
applied so far to banks or gaming firms, to all those involved
in the visa-for-sale industry.
    The European Commission will publish a report on schemes in
EU countries by the end of the year, commissioner Dimitris
Avramopoulos said on Wednesday. He said the report would offer
guidance to member states on managing the programmes, ""including
on necessary background checks for applicants"".  
    Acquiring these documents costs on average 900,000 euros,
but Cyprus' passport could cost up to 2 millions, the report
said. 
    Cyprus has raised 4.8 billion euros ($5.51 billion) from its
scheme, while Portugal could earn nearly a billion euros a year,
according to figures cited in the report, called ""European
Getaway – Inside the Murky World of Golden Visas"".
    EU states generated around 25 billion euros in foreign
direct investment in a decade from selling at least 6,000
passports and nearly 100,000 residency permits, the report said
using what it called conservative estimates.
    ""Money must not be the criterion for citizens' and
residents' rights in the EU,"" said EU lawmaker Sven Giegold, who
sits on the assembly's special committee on financial crimes.
    ""The trade in passports and visas by EU states must be
stopped as soon as possible. These programmes are a gateway to
criminal money,"" he added, echoing the view of other EU
lawmakers.
    The report said in Malta, which has raised 718 million euros
from its scheme, applicants who have criminal records or are
under investigation could still be considered eligible ""in
special circumstances"". 
    ""Poorly managed schemes allow corrupt individuals to work
and travel unhindered throughout the EU and undermine our
collective security,"" Laure Brillaud, anti-money laundering
expert at Transparency International, said.
    All the countries who run these schemes, except Britain,
Cyprus, Ireland and Bulgaria, are part of the Schengen
free-movement area which comprises 26 European states.

French President Emmanuel Macron will be introduced in 2025, but
workers will retain benefits already accrued under the existing
system, said the man liaising between government and unions over
the reform. 
    A trade union leader and business lobby group representative
said they understood it would take 40 years for the new system
to be fully phased in.
    The government wants to align the retirement systems in the
public and private sectors as well as the variety of different
pension set-ups for different professions.
    The new single system would use points so that each euro
paid in would give the same retirement benefits no matter what
sector pensioners worked in.
    Currently, retirement benefits are based on a worker's
salary during the last six months before retirement in the
public sector and the average during the last 25 years in the
private sector.
    ""The implementation of a new, universal system is a response
to the fragility of our current system,"" Jean-Paul Delevoye,
Macron's middleman, told a meeting with labour unions and
business representatives.
    Officials have said France's legal retirement age will
remain 62.
    A decade ago, more than a million people took to the streets
in protest against pension reform. France's more hardline unions
have warned of a repeat if the upcoming changes are not to their
liking.
    ""We think this proposal will lower pensioners' standard of
living to near the poverty threshold,"" said Catherine Perret, a
negotiator for the militant CGT union.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A Brexit deal is ""within reach""
next week, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday, even
as he rammed home his insistence that Britain must accept
possible checks on trade between its mainland and Northern
Ireland.
    ""An agreement is within reach for Oct. 17, next Wednesday,
if we succeed to the end of this negotiation now,"" Barnier said
in a speech to business leaders at the European Parliament.
    EU leaders are due to meet for dinner in Brussels next
Wednesday and hope to agree a withdrawal treaty with Britain
that Barnier said was 80-85 percent ready but on which obstacles
remain, notably on how to keep the new EU-UK land border with
Northern Ireland from reviving conflict in the British province.
    The European Union is doing all it can to ensure checks on
goods moving across Northern Ireland's borders would be made ""in
the least intrusive way possible"", for example on ferries, at
ports or in factories of origin, he said. But veterinary and
food security controls will have to take place at the border. 
    Barnier said Brexit would trigger the need for customs, VAT
and compliance checks with EU standards between Ireland and
Northern Ireland in the event that a planned ""backstop"" were
triggered because a future EU-UK trade deal was not sufficient
in itself to ensure the land frontier was not a ""hard border"". 
    For customs and VAT, Barnier said, ""we propose using the
existing customs procedures to avoid doing checks at the transit
points"". He said customs declarations could be done online in
advance.
    ""The only visible systematic checks between Northern Ireland
and the rest of the UK would involve scanning the bar codes on
lorries or containers, which should be done on ferries or in
transit ports.""
    For industrial goods, he said it could be done by ""market
surveil;ance authorities"", on-site in the companies. But he said
checks of animals and animal-derived products would still have
to take place on the border and cover all of that trade.
    ""Our challenge is to make sure that these procedures are as
easy as possible and not burdensome, particularly for small and
medium businness,"" he said in a speech that ended with a
standing ovation.
    The British government and leading politicians in Northern
Ireland insist they will not agree to a withdrawal treaty that
foresees the possibility of Northern Ireland being kept inside
the EU's economic area while the British mainland is not.

Northern Irish party that British Prime Minister Theresa May's
government relies on for support has said his party will not be
bullied in Brexit talks, and that an unacceptable deal will be
defeated in parliament.
    Writing in the Telegraph, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
lawmaker Sammy Wilson said May's British government should not
blink in negotiations and would face the consequences if it
submitted to ""draconian"" proposals from the European Union that
could keep Britain tied to its customs union.
    ""If the Government decides in the face of EU belligerence to
cut and run and leave part of the UK languishing in the stifling
embrace of the EU, then that would be totally unacceptable to us
and many others in the House of Commons,"" Wilson said, warning
of parliamentary defeat for any deal that crossed his party's
red lines.
    ""We will not be bullied into propping up a soft-touch
Government which gives in to the EU's demands.""    
    Earlier, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said
Britain must accept possible checks on goods moving between its
mainland and its province of Northern Ireland, saying Brexit
would trigger the need for customs, value-added tax and
compliance checks with EU standards. 
    Barnier said he realised such checks were politically
difficult but this was the consequence of Britons voting to
leave the EU.
    Britain has agreed a need for a ""backstop"" deal on the Irish
border in case a future trading arrangement is not finalised.
    But Wilson said reports of a Brexit deal involving either
the UK staying within the customs union for an unspecified
time-limited period or an arrangement that excluded Northern
Ireland from any trade arrangements that the UK made with other
countries in the future would be unacceptable. 
    He also said that the party would oppose the government if
the deal involved EU regulations being applied to goods and
services produced in Northern Ireland and checks on movements of
goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
    The BBC and Sky News have reported that the DUP is
considering voting down the government's budget next month if it
crosses the party's red lines on Brexit.    
    ""If the Government is putting these proposals into the
public domain to test the water, our advice is to get its toe
out quickly or it is going to get burnt,"" Wilson wrote.

    By Joseph Nasr
    WEIDEN, Germany, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Omar Alnifawi was 16
when he fled Syria's civil war with his family. After four years
working menial jobs in Lebanon to help pay for their journey on
to Europe, he had given up on ever going back to school.
    Six years later, Alnifawi is enrolled at the Europa
Vocational School in the southern German state of Bavaria and
plans to become a mechanic.
    ""My friends who live outside Bavaria and who are almost as
old as I am ask me: 'How come you can go back to school and we
can't?',"" he said in the town of Weiden, near the Czech border.
    Politicians in Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), are some of the harshest critics
of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policy. But they
have also put in place one of Germany's most accommodating
education programmes for immigrants allocated to the state.
    Their view is if migrants are in Germany to stay, they need
to go to school so they can work - a pragmatic strategy they
hope will help fill job vacancies, integrate the newcomers and
appeal to voters bleeding left and right in Sunday's regional
election.
    Since the number of asylum seekers started to rise in 2011,
Bavaria has raised the age for compulsory education for asylum
seekers and refugees to 21, against 18 in the other 15 states.
In some cases, like Alnifawi's, educators can apply for an
extension to keep migrants in school until the age of 25.
    Most of the students are in vocational schools, with the
option of moving to university-track high schools if they excel.
    Bavaria has spent hundreds of millions of euros since 2015
to hire more than 2,000 teachers to teach German to some 58,500
refugee children. That compares to 1,500 positions set up by
Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), for
language classes for 95,000 children. 
    This year Bavaria has allocated 938 million euros ($1.1
billion) for integration efforts, more than any other state.
    It can afford to be generous. The state economy, home to
nine blue-chip DAX-30 companies including carmaker BMW,
engineering giant Siemens and sports retailer Adidas, grew 2.8
percent last year, outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent
and resulting in a 3-billion-euro budget surplus, the highest in
Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia had a deficit.
    Bavaria is also acting on the new national philosophy that
migrants today should assume a German national identity, in
sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s when ""guest workers"" were
welcomed on the expectation that they would eventually leave and
not integrate.    
    ""In other states, there is more pro-integration rhetoric and
less action,"" said Prof. Axel Pluennecke of the Cologne
Institute for Economic Research (IW). ""The opposite is true in
Bavaria: the rhetoric might sometimes be negative but the amount
of money and effort being thrown at integration is
incomparable.""
    The effort appears to be paying off. Migrants in the state,
which has taken in some 230,000 asylum seekers, are less likely
to fall into poverty and have higher employment rates than
anywhere else in Germany, according to a bi-yearly report
commissioned by the states to monitor integration.
    Migrant pupils in Bavaria also score higher in national
tests, according to the Education Monitor, a report on the state
of education in Germany published by Pluennecke's institute.
    Asked if NRW plans to raise the mandatory age for refugees
as Bavaria has done, an official at for the state's education
ministry who declined to be named said it was looking into
additional measures for older refugees.
    ""NRW offers young refugees between the ages of 16 to 25 many
education possibilities outside and inside the school system,”
the official added, without giving details. He declined to be
named.
       
    BLUEPRINT?
    Officials at the federal level say they are looking at
Bavaria's programme as a possible blueprint for the nation. 
    ""We are certainly looking at what is being done with
migrants in Bavarian schools,"" said a senior federal official
who is familiar with the government's thinking.
    ""Raising the mandatory vocational school age for migrants
could certainly be one of our recommendations.""
    It is essential that Germany get this right.
    The drop-out rate among migrants is 14.2 percent, compared
with a national average of just under six percent. Migrant youth
without a school certificate will find it harder to get one of
the estimated 1.2 million jobs that are currently vacant - the
main concern of an immigration law agreed October 1.
    ""Most of the young migrants are eager to work. They piled up
debt to come here or they have families to support back home,""
said Thomas Liebig of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. ""If they get a chance to do a small job, they
will and it will be difficult to bring them back into the
education system. So it's important to intercept them early.""
    But polls indicate the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria for
almost six decades, will lose its absolute majority in the
parliament on Oct. 14, giving ground to the ecologist Greens, on
the left, and on the right, the anti-Islam Alternative for
Germany (AfD).
    Political analysts say that's because CSU leader Horst
Seehofer's attempts to sound as anti-immigration as the AfD have
backfired.
    ""Voters who have decided to vote AfD will do so because they
don't believe his anti-immigration rhetoric is genuine,"" said
Julia von Seiche-Nordenheim, chairwoman of the 'Education
instead of Deportation' refugee charity in Regensburg.
    ""At the other end of the spectrum, people don't see refugees
as a threat... Those voters are going to the Greens,"" she said.
A longtime CSU voter, von Seiche-Nordenheim said she plans to
vote for the Green party.     
    
    CUSTOMISATION 
    Another problem in other states is that language courses
funded by the government are only open to accepted refugees and
asylum seekers from five countries with protection approval
rates of 50 percent or more: Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia and
Iran.
    This means that asylum seekers from other countries, who
make up about 50 percent of all applicants, can only access
those courses once their applications have been approved, which
takes seven months on average.
    In Bavaria, mandatory schooling applies to all asylum
seekers, regardless of the status of their application. 
    ""Bavaria has customised its vocational school system to meet
the needs of refugees,"" said Barbara Weiser, a lawyer and
education expert with the Catholic charity Caritas.
    About 55 percent of the 1.6 million people who have come to
Germany seeking asylum over the last four years are under the
age of 25. Many came from war zones and spent years with little
or no schooling. 
    ""Most of the pupils who came to us over the last three years
were unaccompanied minors,"" said Manfred Wichmann, head of the
migrant education programme at the Europa Vocational School. 
""Not only did they come without their parents, they had nothing
to prove what education they had.""
    The school created six classes this year in math, science
and German language, history and culture for 110 migrants. The
programme ends with a test, which between 80 and 85 percent of
pupils have been passing, Wichmann said. Those who fail can
repeat.
    Successful pupils move on to a programme that combines up to
3-1/2 years of on-the-job learning alongside theory lessons at
school. Students choose from dozens of professions, from baking
and hairdressing to banking and electronics.
    In one recent lesson, the teacher quizzed students about
events in Bavaria's history like the 1936 Winter Olympics and
the 1939 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Munich, as well
as contemporary issues such as the regional vote.
    After the class, Alnifawi said he dreams of settling in
Germany with a wife, children and a house in the countryside.
    ""But I know that without an education none of this is
possible.""

    MADRID, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Spain's Socialists, who hold a
minority in parliament and need the support of smaller parties
to pass legislation, have reached a budget deal with
anti-austerity party Podemos, paving the way for the current
government to stay in power until mid-2020.
    Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had faced growing pressure from
within his party to call an early election before scandals
besetting his four-month-old government undermine a surge in
voter support. [L8N1WK3IR]
    But the agreement, which includes raising the minimum wage,
tax hikes and a reform of the rental market and is expected to
be endorsed by other parties, now largely removes that risk. The
next national election should take place by mid-2020.
    The Socialists have just 84 seats in the 350-seat parliament
and with backing from Podemos - bringing them to 151 votes -
they must still enter in talks with parties in Catalonia and the
Basque Country to reach the necessary majority. 
    The opposition conservative People's Party (PP) and
Ciudadanos, which together hold 166 seats in the parliament,
have said they would vote against the budget proposal.
    The agreement includes raising the minimum wage to 900 euros
 ($1,039) a month from the current level of 735.90 euros. It
also includes proposals to reform the housing rental market, a
tax on financial transactions, a tax on digital services and tax
hikes for those earning more than 130,000 euros a year.
    Sanchez is riding high in the polls after his four-month
stint as prime minister and is under pressure from within his
party to consider an early election amid a slew of scandals that
have prompted two ministers to step down and targeted others.

    ROME, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Italian government's plan to
lower the retirement age will cost future generations around 100
billion euros ($115.4 billion), the chief of the state pension
agency INPS said on Thursday.
    The reform ""will increase pension debt for young people by
about 100 billion euros,"" Tito Boeri said in a parliamentary
hearing. 
    ""We have no choice but to sound an alarm,"" he added.
    The populist coalition, made up of anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement and right-wing League party, has promised to roll back
a 2011 reform that hiked the retirement age in a moment when
Italy was at the centre of the eurozone debt crisis.
    The executive has earmarked 7 billion euros ($8.1 billion)
in 2019 budget to allow people to retire at 62 if they have paid
pension contributions for at least 38 years.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said the
measure will allow 400,000 people to retire earlier than
expected, freeing up a similar number of jobs for young people. 
    After meeting a dozen of industry's top managers on
Wednesday night, Salvini said that state-controlled companies
are ready to hire tens of thousands of people if the retirement
age is lowered.[nL8N1WQ5TE]
    The Bank of Italy warned on Tuesday that lowering the
retirement age may put at risk the sustainability of the pension
system. According to studies conducted by the central bank,
there is no evidence that hiking pension age reduces youth
employment.
    Boeri told lawmakers that the new measures would increase
pension spending by 1 percentage point of the gross domestic
product (GDP) already in 2021.

to sell three-year debt on Thursday, in its first bond auction
since Rome's new populist government tripled the budget deficit
target for next year.
    The heavily indebted nation's borrowing costs have jumped
due to investor fears over Rome's plan to boost deficit
spending. The government wants to fund costly electoral promises
such as a lower retirement age and a basic income for the poor.
    Italy sold a new three-year bond at a yield of 2.51 percent,
the highest since September 2013.
    Overall, including other issues maturing over seven, 15 and
30 years, Italy's treasury raised 6.5 billion euros ($7.5
billion), the maximum it had set itself ahead of the auction.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The German economy is losing
steam as rising trade tensions abroad and a lack of skilled
workers at home limit the growth prospects for Europe's largest
economy, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Thursday.
    Presenting the government's downwardly revised growth
forecasts, Altmaier said that the German economy would grow by
1.8 percent in both 2018 and 2019.
    This compared with earlier projections of 2.3 percent and
2.1 percent respectively. In 2017, the German economy grew by a
calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent. [nB4N1SN029]
    Germany's vibrant domestic economy will continue to propel
growth this year and next, with imports rising at a faster pace
than exports and net trade expected to hold back an upswing that
is seen entering its tenth year in 2019, Altmaier said.
    ""This is the longest upswing since 1966, the second longest
ever,"" he added, pointing to record-high employment, rising real
wages and planned tax relief for workers.
    Altmaier said, however, that Germany's growth outlook was
clouded by protectionist tendencies and international trade
disputes. The economy would also expand at a faster rate if
companies found skilled workers more quickly, he added.
    The centre-right minister called for swift implementation of
an EU-U.S. tariffs deal reached earlier this year to solve a
transatlantic trade conflict.
    Germany and its European allies will also support efforts to
safeguard the rules-based free trade order by reforming the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Altmaier said.
    The government's updated growth forecast confirmed a Reuters
report on Wednesday that showed Berlin views an escalation in
the global trade dispute as the main risk for the future.
[nL8N1WQ2R1]
    The minister also blamed revisions to previously reported
output data and slower production in the auto sector due to
difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard - the
Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British banks could face
potential credit rating downgrades if there is a disorderly
Brexit as this would be likely to trigger a domestic political
crisis and economic contraction, credit rating agency Standard &
Poor's said on Thursday.
    S&P said that UK banks' earnings and balance sheets would
provide a solid cushion against a disorderly Brexit. But the
agency also said: ""Their current ratings and/or outlooks may not
prove to be consistent with a disruptive Brexit accompanied by a
severe economic shock.""
    Britain and the European Union are aiming to reach agreement
on a divorce settlement in time for an EU summit next week.
    S&P said that while it expects an orderly departure in March
followed by a transition period to the end of 2020, some
financial institutions have reached a point of no return and are
setting up new hubs in the EU to avoid disruption.
    Even with an orderly Brexit, there would be pressure on
banks to shift euro-denominated clearing of transactions, such
as derivatives, from London-listed LCH <LSE.L> to the EU, S&P
said.
    Fitch Ratings, a rival ratings agency, said that UK banks
are well funded to face a no-deal Brexit, but could face
challenges if wholesale markets were disrupted for a lengthy
period.
    ""Their ratings should be able to withstand economic
deterioration in the no-deal scenarios,"" Fitch said in a
statement. 
    
    EURO CLEARING
    S&P reiterated warnings from the Bank of England on Tuesday
that derivatives markets face disruption from a no-deal Brexit
unless the EU allows EU customers to continue using LCH, part of
the London Stock Exchange, that clears the bulk of euro
denominated swaps. [nL8N1WP2EO]
    Some euro clearing of these transactions has already moved
to rival central counterparty (CCP) Eurex <DB1Gn.DE> in
Frankfurt.
    The EU is in the process of introducing a law that would
require LCH to be supervised by the bloc's regulators as well as
the Bank of England if it wants to continue serving EU
customers.
    ""While dual supervision could yet be a negotiated middle
ground for one or more U.K. CCPs, it appears challenging to
apply effectively in practice, not least when clear and rapid
decision making is required in a crisis,"" S&P said.
    Clearing houses such as LCH act as a financial backstop if
transactions they handle run into trouble.
    Pressure to shift euro clearing would moderately affect LCH,
S&P said.
    ""Our base-case view is that LCH Ltd will maintain its market
leading franchise in OTC interest rate swaps following Brexit,
and an (ratings) upgrade would depend on us becoming
increasingly confident in this outcome,"" the agency said.
    Fitch said there would be significant negative consequences
for banks and financial stability if no interim solution was in
place for derivatives ahead of a no-deal Brexit.

figure includes inward and outward payments)
    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled cross-border transactions
of more than $1 trillion in and out of the country between 2008
and 2017, according to its central bank.
    The European Union member country of just 1.3 million people
has been rocked by revelations that banks there laundered money
from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank
accounts. The scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and 
neighbouring Latvia to shut down.
    The data on cross-border transactions, first reported by
Bloomberg, suggests that the scale of the money laundering
through the small Baltic country may have been larger then
previously thought. The news sent Nordic banking shares sharply
lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all payments, including resident
and non-resident transactions, a spokesman said.
    Estonia's entire economic output came to about $25 billion
last year - roughly the same as that of Uganda or Nepal -
suggesting that much of the money flow was not directly linked
to economic activity in the country.
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the payments suspicious. 
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    The central bank later said the figure in the Bloomberg
report doesn't relate specifically to non-resident transactions
but to all payments in and out of the country, including imports
and exports and routine financial transactions such as
securities purchases. 
    Estonia's imports and exports totalled 232 billion euros
between 2008 and 2017, official data showed. 
    The central bank said in a statement that non-resident flows
""only make up one part of the sum,"" adding that it does not
collect separate data for those transactions.
    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Copenhagen-based expert
on money laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates
that the Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the
problem related to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 3.3 percent and 5.8 percent
lower, respectively. The region's biggest bank Nordea was
trading 2.9 percent lower, while Danske Bank, whose shares have
lost one-third of their value since March, was down 1.5 percent.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,
according to its website. 
    Its Nordic rival SEB <SEBa.ST> also has major operations in
the Baltics after acquisitions in the late 1990s. It had 920,000
private and 99,000 corporate customers according to its 2017
annual report. 
    ""We have very few if any customers that are not based in the
Baltic countries,"" an SEB spokesman said. ""We feel satisfied
that our process concerning these issues works.""
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
    That compares to outgoing payments of $500 billion from
Estonia between 2008 and 2015, according to central bank data.  
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

    ROME, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The cabinet will approve Italy's
2019 budget on Monday, five days before the official deadline
for presenting the financial package, Deputy Prime Minister
Luigi Di Maio said on Thursday.
    The government has already issued the financial targets that
will provide the framework for the budget, drawing fire from the
European Commission for plans to triple the previous fiscal
deficit goal for 2019. [nL8N1WM0IR]
    Ministers have said Brussels should reserve judgement until
full details of the budget are unveiled.
    ""Next week, on Monday, the cabinet will approve the budget,
which will then be sent to Brussels and to parliament,"" Di Maio,
who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement that governs
with the right-wing League, said on Facebook.
    Under Italian law, the government has until Oct. 20 to
approve a budget and pass the bill to parliament for review.
Both houses must then approve the package before the end of the
year.
    Di Maio's comments confirmed remarks made earlier on
Thursday by 5-Star's Senate leader Stefano Patuanelli, who told
reporters the government intended to approve the budget five
days ahead of the deadline, as ""a signal to Europe."" 
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria told a parliamentary
commission on Wednesday that deficit spending would total 22
billion euros ($25.5 billion) next year, with the budget
including 15 billion euros in cuts and extra revenue to help
cover 37 billion in total additional spending. [nL8N1WQ1DK]

raised its economic growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 on
stronger than expected domestic demand, but warned that even an
orderly Brexit would significantly dent growth over the next
several years. 
    In a quarterly report on the health of the economy, the
central bank estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) would
expand by 6.7 percent this year and 4.8 percent next year, up
from forecasts in July of 4.7 and 4.2 percent respectively.
    The Irish government last week forecast GDP growth of 7.5
percent in 2018 and 4.2 percent in 2019. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    Ireland has posted the fastest economic growth in the
European Union every year since 2014 but the relevance of using
the GDP benchmark has been put into doubt by foreign investment
flows skewing the figure.
    The central bank said underlying domestic demand, a measure
that strips out the impact of investment flows by Ireland's
large multinational sector, would grow 5.6 percent this year and
4.2 percent next year. 
    ""The underlying picture suggests that the growth of domestic
economic activity gathered pace in the first half of 2018,"" the
report said. ""Supported by strong and sustained employment
growth and improving household balance sheets, growth in
consumer spending has gained momentum.""
    Growth is also being boosted by construction, with
housebuilding growing by around 25 percent per year as the
country struggles to make up for several years of minimal
construction in the aftermath of the country's economic crisis,
the bank said.  
    The bank also published new estimates of the impact of
Brexit on Ireland. If Brexit leaves World Trade Organisation
rules governing trade between Britain and Ireland, Ireland's GDP
will be 2.9 percent lower in the long run. 
    If the Brexit proposal favoured by British Prime Minister
Theresa May - the so-called Chequers option - Irish GDP would be
1.7 percent smaller than if Britain remained in the EU's single
market and customs union, it said.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Sujata Rao. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has a
blunt message for Italy's leaders: Don't expect us to shield you
or your banks from financial market displeasure at your spending
plans. Sources at the ECB point to European Union rules that
state that cannot help a country unless it has already agreed on
an EU bailout in exchange for belt-tightening and painful
economic reforms - an option Rome has firmly rejected. This
message is in line with the one coming from Brussels sources,
which previously indicated to Reuters that it does not consider
Italy ""too big to save"" - in other words, the EU believes the
eurozone now has the structures in place both to limit any
contagion from Italy and then to clean up the mess afterwards.
As one source familiar with the ECB's thinking said: ""It’s a
test-case to show Europe and its mechanisms work.""
    The general noise coming out of British PM Theresa May's
cabinet meeting last night suggests that she gave ministers the
distinct impression a Brexit deal was imminent. That has in
turned prompted speculation that those ministers on the
hard-Brexit end of the spectrum are equally close to quitting,
given their fears that May's deal will bind the UK into
perennial vassalage; DUP officials are meanwhile talking darkly
of betrayal. In other words, it's all business as usual ahead of
next week's summit and probably only a foretaste of the
grandstanding to come over the next few weeks. Envoys from the
other 27 EU member states meet in Luxembourg to discuss the
state of play today.
    The big election over the weekend is in Bavaria, where the
incumbent conservative CSU party faces a major challenge from
the upstart AfD far-right movement. Polls show the CSU will win
at most 35 percent on Sunday, losing the absolute majority with
which it has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of
the post-war period. One possible outcome is that the socially
conservative party is forced into an alliance with the left-wing
Greens - odd bedfellows indeed. The election also has
consequences for national politics: the CSU are Merkel's
longstanding allies in Berlin, so anything that weakens them in
turn could make her coalition even more fragile. 
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
Is this it for the stock market bulls? Maybe not. After Wall
Street's SP500 fell another 2 percent last night -- weaker-than-
expected inflation numbers failed to staunch the bleeding -- 
futures are pointing to a strong rebound today. Asia’s MSCI
ex-Japan index has bounced 2 percent and Europe is set for a
firmer opening, too. But two big loss-making sessions have left
the S&P500 looking at its third straight week of losses –- the
longest weekly stretch in the red since June 2016.  It’s also
left investors scratching their heads for the reasons – is it
machine-based trading?  Trade tensions? The Fed? One theory has
been that equity markets, especially tech shares, have been
carried higher by momentum, above where they should reasonably
be -- the question is whether the same will apply on the way
down. But maybe that downturn has been deferred for the time
being. U.S. banks today kick off the third-quarter earnings
season, a crucial test for markets. Expectations are the quarter
as a whole will deliver 20 percent-plus earnings growth, which
should be a source of encouragement for equity investors.
    But fears may centre around China, where Shanghai stocks,
despite today’s 1 percent bounce, are set for almost a 10
percent fall this week. And the yuan is biting the dust again
today, down a quarter percent to the dollar to a near four-year
low on nervousness that a U.S. Treasury Department report due
next week will label Beijing a currency manipulator. What’s
more, latest Chinese trade figures may stoke President Donald
Trump’s ire. There’s no sign so far of trade wars denting
Chinese exports -- its trade surplus with the United States hit
a record high in September. However, the trade data may have
helped Shanghai stocks rebound 1 percent. 
    On the currency front, the dollar touched a fresh two-week
low against a currency basket, reeling from the equity selloff,
the weaker inflation data and Trump’s fresh criticism of the
Fed, whose rate rise he called ""ridiculous"".  But the dollar’s
weakness has provided some relief to emerging currencies, with
an index up almost half a percent and others, such as the Indian
rupee, rebounding from record lows. The other emerging-market
weak link -- the Turkish lira -- now seems firmly above 6 per
dollar, approaching two-month highs on hopes that a trial of a
U.S. evangelical pastor will result in his release. Sterling and
euro are motionless this morning, though the former is near
three-week highs, coiled like a spring for any sign of more
Brexit news. 
    European shares  were set to benefit from Asia’s rebound,
with futures extending gains up 0.7 to 1.2 percent across the
main euro zone and UK benchmarks. If the bounce is sustained,
the euro zone STOXX could make up some of this week’s heavy
losses, which have left it on track for its worst week since the
February selloff. Positive comments from the IMF could help
confirm Europe’s rebound: the head of the IMF’s European unit
said the direct impact of potential U.S. car tariffs on Europe
would be relatively limited, though they could still affect
investor sentiment. Big European brewers ABInBev and Carlsberg
could move after a source-based Reuters report that India’s
antitrust watchdog raided their offices in at least two Indian
cities as part of an investigation of alleged price-fixing.  
    In the UK, results from more asset managers are likely to
move shares after Jupiter and Hargreaves Lansdowne disappointed
on Thursday. Both Man Group’s and Ashmore’s funds under
management rose thanks to market gains and net inflows.
    Other stock movers: Sports Direct buys Glasgow department
store Frasers for 95 million pounds; Atalaya Mining to explore
strategic options; Lockheed, Rheinmetall to make joint bid to
supply German navy helicopters; Italy's Carige to look at naming
investment bank for tie-ups; Italy could have around 15 percent

percent; Tencent Music delays $2 billion U.S. IPO; India to

Vonovia buys stake in residential portfolio from SNCF; Brexit
negotiators eye Monday breakthrough -- Northern Irish party ups
the ante.
    Emerging-market stocks rose almost 2 percent, snapping a
six-day losing streak that culminated in the biggest daily fall
since the Brexit vote market turmoil in June 2016. Asian shares
rebounded; Hong Kong, Taiwan and India jumped 2 percent and
China mainland shares gained 1 to 1.5 percent. However, the
latter are on track for their worst week since the emerging=
market rout in early February, while the broader MSCI’s EM index
is on track for a 2.8 percent fall over the week – its third
straight week in the red.
    Emerging-market currencies also chalked up healthy gains.
Turkey’s lira rose nearly 1 percent against the dollar,
extending a 2.5 percent gain the previous day, on expectations
that the standoff between Washington and Ankara over the U.S.
evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson could be resolved soon with
another court hearing in the case set for Friday. The currency
looks on track for a gain of around 4 percent for the week, its
best such advance since mid-August. South Africa’s rand sailed
0.8 percent higher ahead of a Moody’s ratings decision, though
markets widely expect the ratings agency to keep as is and await
the mid-term budget to be delivered by new Finance Minister Tito
Mboweni on Oct. 26.

    * Bavaria's anti-immigration rhetoric particularly harsh 
    * But state doing ""exceptional"" job with migrant education
    * More than half of asylum seekers are under 25
    * CSU poised to lose absolute majority in regional election

    By Joseph Nasr
    WEIDEN, Germany, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Omar Alnifawi was 16
when he fled Syria's civil war with his family. After four years
working menial jobs in Lebanon to help pay for their journey on
to Europe, he had given up on ever going back to school.
    Six years later, Alnifawi is enrolled at the Europa
Vocational School in the southern German state of Bavaria and
plans to become a mechanic.
    ""My friends who live outside Bavaria and who are almost as
old as I am ask me: 'How come you can go back to school and we
can't?',"" he said in the town of Weiden, near the Czech border.
    Politicians in Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), are some of the harshest critics
of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policy. But they
have also put in place one of Germany's most accommodating
education programmes for immigrants allocated to the state.
    Their view is if migrants are in Germany to stay, they need
to go to school so they can work - a pragmatic strategy they
hope will help fill job vacancies, integrate the newcomers and
appeal to voters bleeding left and right in Sunday's regional
election.
    Since the number of asylum seekers started to rise in 2011,
Bavaria has raised the age for compulsory education for asylum
seekers and refugees to 21, against 18 in the other 15 states.
In some cases, like Alnifawi's, educators can apply for an
extension to keep migrants in school until the age of 25.
    Most of the students are in vocational schools, with the
option of moving to university-track high schools if they excel.
    Bavaria has spent hundreds of millions of euros since 2015
to hire more than 2,000 teachers to teach German to some 58,500
refugee children. That compares to 1,500 positions set up by
Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), for
language classes for 95,000 children. 
    This year Bavaria has allocated 938 million euros ($1.1
billion) for integration efforts, more than any other state.
    It can afford to be generous. The state economy, home to
nine blue-chip DAX-30 companies including carmaker BMW,
engineering giant Siemens and sports retailer Adidas, grew 2.8
percent last year, outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent
and resulting in a 3-billion-euro budget surplus, the highest in
Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia had a deficit.
    Bavaria is also acting on the new national philosophy that
migrants today should assume a German national identity, in
sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s when ""guest workers"" were
welcomed on the expectation that they would eventually leave and
not integrate.    
    ""In other states, there is more pro-integration rhetoric and
less action,"" said Prof. Axel Pluennecke of the Cologne
Institute for Economic Research (IW). ""The opposite is true in
Bavaria: the rhetoric might sometimes be negative but the amount
of money and effort being thrown at integration is
incomparable.""
    The effort appears to be paying off. Migrants in the state,
which has taken in some 230,000 asylum seekers, are less likely
to fall into poverty and have higher employment rates than
anywhere else in Germany, according to a bi-yearly report
commissioned by the states to monitor integration.
    Migrant pupils in Bavaria also score higher in national
tests, according to the Education Monitor, a report on the state
of education in Germany published by Pluennecke's institute.
    Asked if NRW plans to raise the mandatory age for refugees
as Bavaria has done, an official at the state's education
ministry who declined to be named said it was looking into
additional measures for older refugees.
    ""NRW offers young refugees between the ages of 16 to 25 many
education possibilities outside and inside the school system,”
the official added, without giving details. 
       
    BLUEPRINT?
    Officials at the federal level say they are looking at
Bavaria's programme as a possible blueprint for the nation. 
    ""We are certainly looking at what is being done with
migrants in Bavarian schools,"" said a senior federal official
who is familiar with the government's thinking.
    ""Raising the mandatory vocational school age for migrants
could certainly be one of our recommendations.""
    It is essential that Germany get this right.
    The drop-out rate among migrants is 14.2 percent, compared
with a national average of just under six percent. Migrant youth
without a school certificate will find it harder to get one of
the estimated 1.2 million jobs that are currently vacant - the
main concern of an immigration law agreed October 1.
    ""Most of the young migrants are eager to work. They piled up
debt to come here or they have families to support back home,""
said Thomas Liebig of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. ""If they get a chance to do a small job, they
will and it will be difficult to bring them back into the
education system. So it's important to intercept them early.""
    But polls indicate the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria for
almost six decades, will lose its absolute majority in the
parliament on Oct. 14, giving ground to the ecologist Greens, on
the left, and on the right, the anti-Islam Alternative for
Germany (AfD).
    Political analysts say that's because CSU leader Horst
Seehofer's attempts to sound as anti-immigration as the AfD have
backfired.
    ""Voters who have decided to vote AfD will do so because they
don't believe his anti-immigration rhetoric is genuine,"" said
Julia von Seiche-Nordenheim, chairwoman of the 'Education
instead of Deportation' refugee charity in Regensburg.
    ""At the other end of the spectrum, people don't see refugees
as a threat... Those voters are going to the Greens,"" she said.
A longtime CSU voter, von Seiche-Nordenheim said she plans to
vote for the Green party.     
    
    CUSTOMISATION 
    Another problem in other states is that language courses
funded by the government are only open to accepted refugees and
asylum seekers from five countries with protection approval
rates of 50 percent or more: Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia and
Iran.
    This means that asylum seekers from other countries, who
make up about 50 percent of all applicants, can only access
those courses once their applications have been approved, which
takes seven months on average.
    In Bavaria, mandatory schooling applies to all asylum
seekers, regardless of the status of their application. 
    ""Bavaria has customised its vocational school system to meet
the needs of refugees,"" said Barbara Weiser, a lawyer and
education expert with the Catholic charity Caritas.
    About 55 percent of the 1.6 million people who have come to
Germany seeking asylum over the last four years are under the
age of 25. Many came from war zones and spent years with little
or no schooling. 
    ""Most of the pupils who came to us over the last three years
were unaccompanied minors,"" said Manfred Wichmann, head of the
migrant education programme at the Europa Vocational School. 
""Not only did they come without their parents, they had nothing
to prove what education they had.""
    The school created six classes this year in math, science
and German language, history and culture for 110 migrants. The
programme ends with a test, which between 80 and 85 percent of
pupils have been passing, Wichmann said. Those who fail can
repeat.
    Successful pupils move on to a programme that combines up to
3-1/2 years of on-the-job learning alongside theory lessons at
school. Students choose from dozens of professions, from baking
and hairdressing to banking and electronics.
    In one recent lesson, the teacher quizzed students about
events in Bavaria's history like the 1936 Winter Olympics and
the 1939 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Munich, as well
as contemporary issues such as the regional vote.
    After the class, Alnifawi said he dreams of settling in
Germany with a wife, children and a house in the countryside.
    ""But I know that without an education none of this is
possible.""

euro zone increased in August by more than forecast, reversing
the negative trend of the previous two months in what could
prove a boost for the bloc's economic growth in the third
quarter, data released on Friday showed.
   The European Union statistics agency Eurostat said industry
output in the 19-country currency bloc was up in August by 1.0
percent on the month and by 0.9 percent year-on-year.
   Both figures are a positive surprise after economists polled
by Reuters had forecast a smaller 0.4 percent rise
month-on-month and a 0.2 percent drop from a year earlier.
    The monthly production growth in August reversed declines in
June and July, which had strengthened the view of a slowdown in
the euro zone's economy into and in the third quarter, hit by
global trade tensions and falling economic sentiment.
    The bloc grew by 0.4 percent in the two first quarters of
the year. Eurostat will release its preliminary flash estimate
of euro zone's growth in the third quarter on October 30.
    Eurostat also revised up its previous estimates for
industrial production in July. It said on Friday that output
fell by 0.7 percent on the month instead of the 0.8 percent drop
estimated earlier. Year-on-year, production increased by 0.3
percent instead of falling by 0.1 percent.
    The August output growth on the month was driven by a 1.9
percent rise in energy production, data showed.
     The production of durable consumer goods, like cars and
fridges, also increased by 1.5 percent, partly offsetting its
1.9 percent drop of the previous month.
    The surprising large increase in the output in a summer
month was also due to a 1.4 percent rise in the production of
non-consumer goods, like clothes, and of capital goods, such as
machineries, which tend to indicate managers' growing appetite
for investments.
    The overall increase came despite no expansion of industrial
output in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, Eurostat
data showed. The figures are not the same as those already
reported by Germany, which showed a slight fall in August, but a
less pronounced decline in July. [nL8N1WO0UI]

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Italy must respect
European Union budget rules with its 2019 budget and improve
public finances if it wants to create headroom to loosen fiscal
policy during the next economic downturn, a top International
Monetary Fund official said.
    Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF's European department,
told a news conference on Friday that Rome was wrong to target
an increase in its headline and structural budget deficit next
year in breach of EU budget rules.
    ""We still project relatively strong growth in Italy next
year. This is not the time to relax fiscal policy, this is the
time to have some fiscal structural adjustment,"" Thomsen said at
the IMF's annual meeting on the Indonesian resort island of
Bali.
    The populist government in Rome plans a headline gap of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's 
target. EU officials estimate this would translate in to a rise
in the structural deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP, while EU rules
ask for a 0.6 percent cut, rather than an increase.
    ""A fiscal relaxation of that magnitude... is not correct.
The market reaction has been quite unfavourable and that
illustrates the point about fiscal space,"" Thomsen said.
     Investors have been selling Italian bonds in reaction to
the higher borrowing plan with yields of the three year paper
hitting 5-year highs at an auction on Thursday and 10-year
benchmark paper trading at 4.5 year highs <IT10YT=TWEB>.
    The European Commission, which is the guardian of EU rules,
and euro zone finance ministers have said the planned deficit
most likely meant a rise in Italy's public debt which is already
the second biggest in Europe at 133 percent of GDP.
    Italy's Economy Minister Giovanni Tria raised many eyebrows
earlier this month at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers
when he said in an ad-hoc presentation of the draft that despite
the deficit increase, debt would fall.
    EU officials at the Bali meeting said this would only be
possible if economic growth generated by the higher deficit was
very high.
    But the 1.4 percent economic growth forecast by the Italian
government for next year and 1.5 seen in 2020 has already been
declared as too optimistic by the Italian Fiscal Board - an
independent body set up to check budget assumptions.
    EU officials also note that higher borrowing costs for
Italy, triggered by the announcement of the higher deficit plans
already offset much of the expected higher growth. 
    ""If anybody has to give advice to Italy it's to be careful
what it's doing,"" Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz said in
Bali on Friday.
    Tria reaffirmed his ""intention to maintain a constructive
dialogue with the EU Commission and the other euro area
partners"" on Friday after meeting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin in the resort island.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May was struggling on Friday to find consensus on Brexit
proposals that would be acceptable to her ministers, her
Conservative Party and the Northern Irish lawmakers who prop up
her minority government. 
    Brexit negotiations with the European Union have accelerated
and become more positive over the past week, though significant
hurdles remain, finance minister Philip Hammond said.
    ""What has happened over the last week, 10 days, is that
there has been a measurable change in pace,"" he told the BBC. 
    ""But that shouldn't conceal the fact that we still have some
big differences left to resolve,"" Hammond said. ""So process is a
lot more positive this week - substance still very challenging.""
    With less than six months to go until the United Kingdom is
due to leave the EU, May is seeking to rally support at home on
the details of a divorce deal though it is unclear if she can
win parliament's approval for any agreement.
    British and EU negotiators are making headway on the Irish
border issue, the biggest hurdle to an overall agreement, and
hope for a Brexit deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said.
[nL8N1WR36O]
    The Irish border ""backstop"", which seeks a way to avoid
customs checks on the frontier between the British province of 
Northern Ireland and Ireland if there is no overall exit deal,
has become the biggest sticking point in negotiations.
    As both sides seek to clinch a deal, the United Kingdom will
publish on Friday more of its so-called technical notices which
lay out the impact of a no-deal Brexit on specific sectors of
the economy. [nL8N1WA4KA]
    
    DEAL OR NO-DEAL?
    May's Northern Irish supporters vehemently oppose any checks
between the province and mainland Britain after Brexit.
    The head of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster,
said May ""could not in good conscience"" back an EU proposal for
checks on goods being imported to Northern Ireland from Britain
after Brexit.
    Under May's proposals, the whole of the United Kingdom would
forge a customs partnership with the EU after a transition
period ends in December 2020 in the event of the backstop being
triggered.
    Some of May's ministers have urged her to put a time limit
on that plan.
    The Times newspaper said May was warned the issue was so
serious that she could face further cabinet resignations unless
she found a way to ensure the backstop was not permanent. 
    Speaking to Northern Ireland journalists at her Downing
Street office, May said on Thursday that talks on the Irish
backstop were likely to continue until November.

    PARIS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - France demanded on Friday that
Saudi Arabian authorities provide detailed and truthful answers
over the fate of veteran Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who
disappeared in Turkey over a week ago.
    France, whose ambassador to Saudi met Foreign Minister Adel
al-Jubeir on Thursday, has been hitherto guarded in its
reaction. Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic ties and
commercial relations spanning energy to finance and arms. 
    ""The disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul ... has
raised serious questions about his fate. France asks that the
facts be clearly established and that all those who can
contribute to the truth fully contribute to it,"" Foreign
ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll said in a statement. 
    ""This is the message we passed to Saudi authorities. The
charges brought against them require that they be transparent
and provide a complete and detailed response.""
    France has in recent years nurtured close links with the
Sunni-ruled Gulf Arab states, notably Saudi Arabia, which valued
Paris' tough stance on Iran in nuclear negotiations and are
closely aligned with regard to other Middle East conflicts.
    Saudi is one of France's biggest weapons purchasers, but
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's uncompromising effort to
counter Iran's growing influence in the region are sometimes
perceived as reckless in Paris.
    Diplomats talk of tough conversations in private between
President Emmanuel Macron and Prince Mohammed. Macron has,
though, been careful not antagonise the kingdom.

chief Guenther Oettinger said on Friday Britain would lose its
rebate even in the ""pleasant but improbable"" event of it staying
in the bloc. 
    On March 29, Britain is due to become the first country to
ever leave the EU. It expects a status-quo transition until the
end of 2020 during which it would continue paying contributions
to the bloc and follow its rules.
    It would in exchange keep access to the bloc's single market
and customs union but no longer have a say in decision-making
that would be done by the other 27 states staying in the EU.
    After Brexit, the EU wants to wind down in stages all the
rebates, including those that the Netherlands or Denmark enjoy.
[nL8N1WS26X] The bloc's executive European Commission has
proposed to have none in the next common budget for 2021-2024.
    ""I think that even for the pleasant but improbable case that
the British wish to remain... then in my budgetary framework I
would stick to the phased ending of rebates. The rebates, in a
family of 27, are no longer appropriate.""
    Britain currently can recover about a half of its
contributions to the bloc through the deal. 
    Many question whether Britain and the EU can finalise
extremely complex negotiations on a new, broad trade pact in
less than two years. 
    Any extension of the transition period, as suggested by
Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond on Friday
[nL9N1VZ00W], would raise the issue of the British rebate as it
would coincide with the bloc entering the new budgetary period
that could already be rebate-free.

Le Pen met Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon and
backed his plan to advise eurosceptic parties ahead of next
year's European elections, a senior lawmaker in her party said
on Friday.
    A few days earlier, Le Pen had appeared to distance herself
from Bannon. At a meeting with Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini on Monday, she said Bannon was American and it
was up to European parties to shape their own politics.
    But at their meeting on Thursday, Bannon, an architect of
President Trump's 2016 election victory and former chairman of
Breitbart news, may have won Le Pen round, according to Louis
Aliot, a senior member of Le Pen's National Rally and also her
partner. 
    ""Bannon wants to create a think-tank, and particularly wants
to provide technical support to eurosceptic parties,"" Aliot told
BFM TV. ""We're not going to say no since he's not creating a
political party.""
    In July, Bannon said he aimed to create an organisation
called The Movement to unite Europe's far-right ahead of the May
2019 European Parliament elections. But he has generated little
support from parties so far. 
    Aliot said any misunderstandings between Bannon and Le Pen
had been reconciled during their meeting.
    ""We've seen that there was a convergence of views,"" Aliot
said, adding that Bannon would not campaign in the European
elections or provide financing, but would offer advice and
expertise. 
    Le Pen, who has struggled to rebound since losing last
year's presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron, is
banking on the European election to boost her party, which came
first in France in the last such vote, in 2014.
    The campaign is shaping up as a battle between Macron's
vision of a more integrated, united European Union and Le Pen's
view that too much national identity has been surrendered to
Brussels.
    In a survey by pollster Elabe last week, the number of
French voters who regard the EU as having more benefits than
drawbacks dropped by eight percentage points from a year ago, to
24 percent. 
    Thirty-eight percent said the EU brought more drawbacks than
benefits, while nearly two-thirds said they did not think Macron
would be able to change the EU for the better, despite it being
one of his main policy goals.
    Bannon won resounding applause for a speech at a Le Pen's
party congress in March [nL5N1QS0J2] and has maintained regular
contacts since, party officials said.

 (Recasts with Schaeuble interview, Kurz remarks)
    By Jörn Poltz and Andrea Shalal
    MUNICH/BERLIN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's political standing has suffered in recent months and
poor results in two upcoming state elections could lead to
""bigger changes"", her long-time conservative ally, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, said on Friday.
    Schaeuble, a powerful former finance minister who now heads
the lower house of parliament, told the broadcaster SWR that
Merkel was likely be re-elected to lead the Christian Democrats
(CDU) at a December party congress if she ran - but did not rule
out the possibility that she might not stand.
    ""She is not as undisputed as she was over the last three
legislative periods,"" Schaeuble said, adding that regional
elections in Bavaria and Hesse this month would inevitably
affect her ""standing"".
    ""We know there are state elections before us. The results
are open. They can result in bigger changes,"" he said.
    Merkel, now in her fourth term, has been a popular and
formidable leader for 13 years.
    But support for her conservative bloc has waned since she
decided in 2015 to open the doors to over 1 million migrants,
boosting the far-right and forcing her this year to cobble
together a frail and loveless national coalition with the Social
Democrats.
    The decision also fuelled divisions with the CDU's Bavarian
sister party, the CSU, which on Sunday faces the prospect of its
worst showing in a state election in more than 60 years,
suffering, just like the CDU, from the surging anti-immigrant
Alternative for Germany (AfD).
    Polls suggest the CSU will win at most 35 percent, losing
the absolute majority that has allowed it to control Bavaria for
most of the post-war period, while the AfD is set to enter the
state assembly for the first time with up to 14 percent.
    The Munich-based manufacturer MTU Aero Engines <MTXGn.DE>
issued an unusual pre-election message to employees, urging them
to vote ""responsibly"" and shun populism, similar to local
guidance issued by the consulting firm EY.
    While stressing that it was not urging support for any one
party, MTU told employees in a letter: ""Germany, and especially
a strategically-orientated industry like ours, relies on stable
political conditions.""
    Reflecting the strains among conservatives, it was Austrian
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz who gave the keynote speech at a final
CSU rally in Munich on Friday, a spot traditionally reserved for
the CDU leader.
    Merkel's fourth and probably final government has twice come
close to collapsing - over immigration and a scandal over
Germany's former domestic spymaster - and now a debate over how
to phase out polluting diesel cars threatens to boil over.
    Polls also suggest the CDU will suffer heavy losses in the
state of Hesse on Oct. 28.

Bank policy is working as intended and the biggest risks to the
policy outlook are a sharp repricing of assets or a sudden rise
in interest rates, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Saturday.
    He said that specific risks include lingering stability
issues in the banking sector or a surprising increase in
inflation, which appears unlikely in the euro zone but a more
relevant issue in the United States.
    On the downside, a risk would be a ""snap back"" in rates
relating to geopolitical issues, such as trade tensions, a
renegotiation of EU rules by member nations or infringement on
central bank independence by governments, the ECB chief added.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank should keep its policy options open and not let itself be
influenced by the Federal Reserve, ECB policymaker Francois
Villeroy de Galhau said on Sunday.
    Encouraged by a recovery in euro zone inflation, the ECB
expects to stop adding to its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.0 trillion)
pile of bonds at the end of this year and has guided the market
to expect a rate hike some time in late 2019. 
    Villeroy said the ECB would soon decide how to reinvest the
proceeds of the bonds that expire next year but should not yet
commit beyond that point.
    ""We should keep our options open about the timing of our
reinvestment in the following years,"" he told a conference on
the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's annual
meeting in the Indonesian resort town of Nusa Dua.
    The French central bank governor added that rate-setters
should wait a little longer to clarify their guidance on
interest rates, which currently just says they will stay at
their current, rock-bottom level ""at least through the summer of
2019"".
    ""As we approach the summer of 2019, the balance will shift
in favour of detailing our forward guidance,"" Villeroy said.
    Six rate hikes by the Fed in 1-1/2 years have sent the U.S.
dollar rallying against the currencies of fragile emerging
economies such as Argentina and Turkey, forcing their central
banks to also increase borrowing costs to arrest the slide.
    The euro zone has been relatively insulated and Villeroy
said the ECB should proceed at its own pace.
    ""I think the euro area can determine its own course,"" he
said.

ministers should ""exert their collective authority"" to force a
change in her Brexit strategy, former Brexit minister David
Davis said on Sunday, stepping up pressure on Britain's leader.
    In an article in the Sunday Times newspaper, Davis again
pressed May to abandon her proposal for leaving the European
Union, saying the bloc ""has rejected it. The public does not
like it. Parliament will not vote for it"".
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU in
its biggest trade and foreign policy shift in more than 40
years, May is struggling to get backing for not only her vision
for future ties with the bloc but also over a so-called backstop
deal for Northern Ireland, one of the trickiest hurdles left.
    Talks with Brussels have been all but non-stop before a
summit on Wednesday when the two sides hope to agree a draft
withdrawal treaty to outline the divorce terms, including a
transition agreement and a solution to Northern Ireland.
    Davis, who again criticised the government of which he was
once part for accepting ""the EU's language on dealing with the
Northern Ireland border"" in December, said it was now up to the
so-called cabinet of top ministers to exert their influence.
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" Davis wrote.
    ""This week the authority of our constitution is on the
line.""
    Davis also said Britain should use the 39 billion pounds
Britain has agreed in a financial settlement with the EU as the
""biggest bargaining chip"" to secure a beneficial future trading
relationship with the bloc.

budget rules and must settle its differences with Brussels over
higher state spending in talks with the European Union's
executive, a senior International Monetary Fund official was
quoted on Sunday as saying.
    The comments by the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director
David Lipton to German business daily Handelsblatt came after
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi urged Italian
officials to stop questioning the euro.
    ""In our view, the Italian government should abide by the
European rules and agreements,"" Lipton said in an interview.
""The discussions on the draft budget must now be conducted
between Italy and the European Commission.""
    The Italian coalition has set a deficit target of 2.4
percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous goal
for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving investors and
prompting sharp criticism from the Commission. [nL8N1WP21C]
    Lipton warned that the budget dispute could delay planned
reforms to make the euro zone more resilient to external shocks.
""We hope that the further deepening of the monetary union will
not be hindered. We consider the completion of the Capital and
Banking Union to be very important,"" he said.
    A euro zone summit in December should bring progress on the
reform agenda, he added.
    Draghi said on Saturday that Italian officials need to ""calm
down"" in their budget debate as they have already caused damage
to firms and households. A senior member of the coalition
retorted that it was Draghi who should calm down. [nL2N1WT04J]
    Deeper euro zone integration has been championed by French
President Emmanuel Macron since his election last year, but has
run into opposition from Germany and its allies, wary of sharing
more responsibility with less fiscally prudent governments.
    EU leaders agreed in June that the ESM bailout fund should
play a bigger role in a more integrated euro zone, but left the
details to December and difficult issues such as a euro zone
budget or deposit insurance scheme until an unspecified future
date. [nL8N1TV3AV]

needed.

    By Axel Bugge
    LISBON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Portugal's prime minister
announced a reshuffle of his cabinet on Sunday, following the
resignation of the defence minister and completion of the draft
of next year's budget, making changes at four ministries ahead
of a general election in 2019.
    Cabinet Minister Pedro Siza Vieira, a lawyer who joined the
government a year ago, will serve as the new economy minister,
replacing Manuel Caldeira Cabral.
    Joao Gomes Cravinho, the European Union's ambassador to
Brazil, will take over from outgoing Defence Minister Jose
Azeredo Lopes, who resigned on Friday amid an investigation into
a suspected cover-up of an arms theft from a military depot.
[nL8N1WS52C]      
    This is the biggest cabinet reshuffle since Prime Minister
Antonio Costa's minority Socialist government came to power in
2015 and aims to bolster the administration going into next
year's election. The Socialists lead in opinion polls with about
40 percent support.
    Costa said in a statement the reshuffle ""reinforces economic
policy at the centre of government and prioritises the
transition of energy (use) to mitigate climatic change.""
    Siza Vieira joined the government a year ago from the law
firm Linklaters and will continue as cabinet minister as well as
economy minister. The powerful economy ministry has recently
gained further importance thanks to surging foreign investment
and strong economic growth.
    The reshuffle comes after the government approved this
weekend the 2019 draft budget which will be presented to
parliament on Monday.
    The Socialist government has overseen a strong economic
recovery since Portugal's 2011-14 debt crisis with policies to
ease austerity measures, boost foreign investment and spur a
fledgling technology sector.  
    The reshuffle also includes the transfer of responsibility
for the energy sector to the environment ministry from the
economy ministry, indicating a stronger emphasis on clean
energy.
    Portugal produces a large part of its energy from
hydro-electric power and is boosting other alternative energy
sources such as solar and wind.     
    The other changes include the appointment of Graca Maria da
Fonseca as the new minister of culture after working as
secretary of state for administrative modernisation.
    Marta Temido, who previously headed the central
administration of the public health system, will take over as
health minister.
    President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has to approve the
nominations, said in a statement the new ministers would
be sworn in on Monday.

    * Support for junior coalition partner SPD halved
    * Results seen as vote against grand coalition

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Germany woke up on Monday to the
news that its crisis-prone government could become even more
unstable after the parties ruling in a loveless coalition
suffered humiliating results in an election in the southern
state of Bavaria.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies slumped to their
worst election results in almost 70 years and her junior
coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), saw
support in Bavaria halved.
    ""It's gonna be turbulent,"" headlined the Die Welt newspaper.
""The result in Bavaria is a vote against the grand coalition in
Berlin.""
    The SPD had hoped that infighting over immigration between
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian
Social Union (CDU) allies would give them a boost in Bavaria.
    But instead, the party saw support fall to just under 10
percent, prompting a discussion over the sustainability of its
alliance with Merkel's conservatives at the national level.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
 join a Merkel-led government after vowing before the general
election in September 2017 to sit in opposition if they lost to
the conservatives. They are now demanding consequences.
    The party's General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told
Deutschlandfunk radio that members  wanted a change in the style
of government.
    SPD leaders have promised members opposed to a coalition
with the conservatives they will hold a review after two-years
in government and decide whether the partnership was still
viable.
    Asked if disgruntled SPD members were demanding that the
review be brought forward, Klingbeil said:
    ""The evaluation is planned for the middle of the legislative
period but something must happen now. There must be different
style of government.""
    He said the CSU under Horst Seehofer must stop picking
arguments, especially on issues like migrant policy. ""If the
style of government doesn't change, there will be a debate in
the SPD and the critical voices will get stronger,"" he said.
    Polls indicate that the ruling parties will be chastened
again in two weeks in an election in the western state of Hesse,
where they are expected to bleed support to the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the ecologist Greens.
    The state is ruled by Merkel's CDU in a coalition with the
Greens and a slump in support for the conservatives there would
almost certainly further weaken her authority.
    ""If the CDU loses the government in Hesse, this will
probably start a discussion within the CDU about Merkel's
position,"" wrote mass-selling Bild.

failing banks intends to hold  nearly 33 billion euros ($38.18
billion) in 2019, up from 25 billions this year, the head of the
agency that manages the fund said on Monday.
    The move is in line with plans to gradually increase the
Single Resolution Fund to at least 1 percent of all covered
deposits in euro zone banks by the end of 2023, which is
estimated to be between 55 billion and 60 billion euros.
    ""The SRF will continue to grow to just short of 33 billion
in 2019. The amounts will be invested to ensure value protection
and high liquidity,"" Elke Koenig, who chairs the Single
Resolution Board, told a banking conference in Brussels.
    The fund is financed by euro zone banks and is meant to help
failing lenders, and reduce costs for taxpayers when banks fail.
    Euro zone states are discussing establishing a safety net
for the SRF that would allow the fund to intervene in a major
crisis with more than one large bank in trouble.
    Details of the so-called SRF backstop are due to be
finalised in December.
    EU leaders agreed in June to give the state rescue fund, the
European Stability Mechanism, more powers to help the banking
fund [nL8N1TV3AV].
    Once allowed to act as a backstop, the ESM could offer a
revolving credit line of the same size as the bank fund.

    * May due in Brussels for summit on Wednesday
    * EU 'treating us with naked contempt' - Johnson

    By Amanda Ferguson and Elizabeth Piper
    BELFAST/LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister
Theresa May was under mounting pressure on Monday to rethink her
plan for leaving the European Union after Brexit talks reached a
stand-off at the weekend over the so-called Irish backstop.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc and days
before May heads to Brussels for a summit on Wednesday when both
sides hope to make progress, the Brexit talks were paused on
Sunday after the two sides failed to agree on how to deal with
the United Kingdom's only land border with the EU.
    The problem of how to prevent the return of a hard border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member
Ireland has become the biggest hurdle to a deal on Brexit,
Britain's biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years.
    May, a self-declared unionist who has said repeatedly that
she could not countenance the breakup of the United Kingdom, is
struggling to find a way to satisfy the demands of not only the
EU, but of her Conservative Party and her partners in
parliament, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    For now, there has been little success in narrowing the gap
between those competing demands, and Ireland's Foreign Minister
Simon Coveney said any deal would now ""take a bit more time than
many people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    The DUP, which has threatened to pull support from the
government over the backstop row, said it now believed a no-deal
Brexit was almost inevitable and described the talks in Brussels
as turning into a ""battle for the union"".
    ""Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner
they've put Theresa May into, there's no deal which I can see at
present which will command a majority in the House of Commons,""
said the party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson.
    ""So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a
no-deal scenario,"" he told the Belfast News Letter.
    May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, the figurehead
of Britain's Brexit campaign and one of the bookmakers'
favourites to replace May, was equally critical, saying the
talks were ""now entering the moment of crisis"". [nL8N1WU10R]
    ""In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of
the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt,""
he wrote in his weekly column in the Telegraph newspaper.
    ""It is time to scrap the backstop.""
    
    BACKSTOP TO A BACKSTOP
    It was that kind of opposition which made it impossible for
May's Brexit minister Dominic Raab to agree to a deal in
Brussels on Sunday.
    British officials said London could not agree to Brussels'
demand to have ""a backstop to a backstop"", which would see the
EU's proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the bloc's customs
union if a new trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Britain has long said it wants an agreement on a future
relationship with the EU, which London sees as including a
common rule book for manufactured and agricultural products,
which would negate any need for a backstop plan for Ireland.
    But EU negotiators have criticised that proposal, and said
on Sunday it was clear that, as things stood, May did not feel
she could get a deal through her cabinet of ministers, who will
meet on Tuesday.
    EU officials and diplomats say they will ""keep calm and
carry on"", hoping May can sort out her problems in London. 
    British officials were optimistic of making some progress at
the EU summit this week, with foreign minister Jeremy Hunt
telling reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are one or two very
difficult outstanding issues but I think we can get there.
Whether we do this week or not, who knows? But I know everyone
is trying incredibly hard.""
    But any solution to the border question looked far off.
Ireland again said Britain must make good on its commitment to
have a backstop plan. [nL8N1WV201]
    ""For us we want to see an outcome here that settles nerves,
that allows us to move ahead with a managed, sensible Brexit,""
Ireland's Coveney told reporters. 
    ""I still think it's possible to do that, but clearly it's
going to take a bit more time than many people had hoped.""

    * Italy's government seeks better Russia ties

    By Robin Emmott
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A European Union sanctions
plan to punish computer hackers is not directed at Russia or any
one single country, Lithuania's foreign minister said on Monday,
as Italy came under pressure from a group of EU members states
to back the proposal.
    Seven EU countries including Britain, the Netherlands and
Lithuania are pushing for the EU to be able to impose sanctions
more quickly on specific individuals anywhere in the world,
freezing their assets in the bloc and banning them from entry,
according to an EU document obtained by Reuters.
    Russia has made cyber and electronic warfare a key part of
its military operations, Western officials say, and Britain, the
Netherlands and the United States have accused Moscow of
conducting a global campaign of computer hacks against the West.
[nL8N1WK35D]
    But Rome, where the anti-establishment government wants to
have better ties with Russia, fears the sanctions would alienate
Moscow and it opposes the EU plan, according to a confidential
document seen by Reuters.
    ""We would not target a single geography. This is not against
Russia by default,"" Lithuania's Linas Linkevicius told Reuters
before a meeting with other EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. 
    ""If Russia attacks us, we will target Russia. If someone
else attacks us, then we will target them,"" he said.
    Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's co-ruling far-right
League, has expressed his admiration for Russian President
Vladimir Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling
in Western elections.
    Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will try to reassure
his Italian counterpart Enzo Moavero Milanesi on Monday that the
proposal, which London hopes to have agreed before it leaves the
EU next March, is not against Russia, diplomats said.    
    Belgium, Sweden and Poland are also broadly in favour but
want more discussion, a second internal document showed. EU
diplomats hope EU leaders could back the sanctions plan in their
final statement at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
    ""It is only a matter of time before we are hit by a critical
operation with severe consequences on the EU and member states,""
the three-page proposal document said, urging action on cyber
defences which have been under discussion since 2015.
    ""We need to be ready to respond,"" it said.
    EU and NATO diplomats believe China and North Korea, as well
as Russia, have developed sophisticated computer hacking weapons
and cybersurveillance software to spy on and undermine the West,
often using criminal groups to mask the origin of such attacks.
    The EU cyber regime plan follows a similar sanctions
mechanism formally agreed by ministers on Monday to punish
chemical weapons' attacks by targeting people blamed for using
banned munitions regardless of their nationality. [nL8N1WA1XJ]

    The cabinet was initially due to approve the measure, which

    The government has already issued the financial framework
for the budget - raising the target for next year's deficit to
2.4 percent of gross domestic product - and is still expected to
approve a linked fiscal decree later on Monday.

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Bavarian sister party said on Monday it would back political
stability in Berlin after suffering big losses in a regional
election which their far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake""
that would rock the coalition government.
    The conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) slumped to its
worst election result in almost 70 years in Sunday's election in
Bavaria and Merkel's other coalition partner, the centre-left
Social Democrats (SPD) saw their support halve. [nL8N1WU02P]
    CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who is also interior minister in
Merkel's loveless coalition, had hoped his anti-immigration
rhetoric and criticism of Merkel's liberal asylum policies would
help his party fend off a threat from the far-right in Bavaria.
    But his strategy backfired as the CSU, which has ruled
Bavaria for almost six decades, bled votes to the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the ecologist Greens in
equal measure.
    ""We will do our bit to ensure that the coalition can
continue to do its work in a stable manner despite some of the
comments that were made yesterday,"" Seehofer told reporters.
    He was referring to angry CSU delegates who blamed their
party's dismal showing on Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome
some one million, mainly Muslim, asylum seekers, which has
fuelled the rise of the AfD.
    Asked if his leadership of the CSU was in question, Seehofer
said he would not discuss personnel matters in his party.
    The AfD gleefully seized on the Bavarian election outcome as
a sign of a broader, national malaise with Merkel's coalition,
which has been shaken by a series of disputes, including over
immigration, since it took power just seven months ago.
    ""We are very pleased because the goal for the Bavaria state
election was to send an earthquake towards Berlin,"" Martin
Sichert, AfD leader in Bavaria, told a news conference. ""This
earthquake happened ... we are now excited to see what the
consequences will be here in Berlin.""
    The CSU also lost support to the Free Voters, a protest
party of mainly conservative independents.
    In Bavaria, the CSU will now try to form a coalition either
with the Free Voters - its preferred option - or with the Greens
who are ideologically distant.
    
    ""PAINFUL""
    Germany's ruling coalition was borne of necessity rather
than choice after an inconclusive general election in September
2017.
    The Bavarian election was also a wake-up call for the SPD,
which saw its support halve to just under 10 percent, prompting
a discussion over the sustainability of its alliance at national
level with Merkel's conservative bloc.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
 join the Merkel-led government in Berlin after vowing before
the 2017 election to sit in opposition if they lost to the
conservatives. They are now demanding consequences.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles blamed her party's bad fortune in
Bavaria on infighting between Merkel's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) and Seehofer's CSU at national level.
    ""It is obvious that the whole style of our cooperation must
change,"" she told reporters. ""One state election alone, as
painful as it is, does not answer the question of whether the
grand coalition is working. We urgently need to work on the
style and communication and also on substantive progress."" 
    Polls suggest the ruling parties will again be punished in
two weeks' time in an election in the western state of Hesse,
where they are expected to lose voters to the AfD and the
Greens.
    The state is ruled by Merkel's CDU in a coalition with the
Greens and a slump in support for the conservatives there would
almost certainly further weaken the chancellor's authority.
    Merkel, who has been in power since 2005 and is Europe's
most powerful leader, then faces further potential pitfalls in
the form of a CDU conclave and the party's annual congress in
early December.
    The 64-year-old Merkel has won support from key
conservatives in her bid  for re-election as CDU chairwoman at
the congress. But this could change if the CDU loses Hesse to an
SPD-Greens coalition.
    ""If the CDU loses the government in Hesse, this will
probably start a discussion within the CDU about Merkel's
position,"" wrote mass-selling Bild.

 (Adds May's spokesman, EU diplomats)
    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will face mounting pressure on Monday to rethink her plan
for leaving the European Union after Brexit talks reached a
stand-off at the weekend over the so-called Irish backstop.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc and days
before May heads to Brussels for a summit on Wednesday when both
sides hope to make progress, the Brexit talks were paused on
Sunday after the two sides failed to agree on how to deal with
the United Kingdom's only land border with the EU.
    May was to make a statement to parliament later on Monday.
    The talks stumbled over how to prevent the return of a hard
border between the British province of Northern Ireland and
EU-member Ireland after Britain leaves in its biggest shift in
policy for more than 40 years. 
    May, who has said repeatedly that she could not countenance
the breakup of the United Kingdom, is struggling to find a way
to satisfy the demands of not only the EU, but of her
Conservative Party and her partners in parliament, Northern
Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    There has been little success in narrowing the gap between
those competing demands, and Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon
Coveney said any deal would now ""take a bit more time than many
people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    But a spokesman for May said there were ""a number of means
of achieving what we want to achieve"" on the backstop. He
declined to give details and repeated Britain's view that any
such arrangement would be time-limited.[nS8N1U8006]
    ""We are not going to be stuck permanently in single customs
territory unable to do meaningful trade deals,"" he said.
    At the weekend, EU diplomats said London had urged Brussels
to accept assurances that Britain would effectively stay in a
customs union with the bloc to make the backstop unnecessary.
The EU said it would need an insurance policy. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    Much will depend on whether May can sell any deal to her
Conservative Party and the DUP, which has threatened to pull
support from the government if she agrees to different rules for
the province.
    
    BACKSTOP TO A BACKSTOP
    Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, said it now
believed a no-deal Brexit was almost inevitable and described
the talks in Brussels as turning into a ""battle for the union"".
    ""Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner
they've put Theresa May into, there's no deal which I can see at
present which will command a majority in the House of Commons,""
Wilson told the Belfast News Letter.
    May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, the figurehead
of Britain's Brexit campaign and one of the bookmakers'
favourites to replace May, was equally critical.
    ""In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of
the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt,""
he wrote in the Telegraph newspaper. [nL8N1WU10R]
    It was that kind of opposition which made it impossible for
May's Brexit minister Dominic Raab to agree to a deal in
Brussels on Sunday.
    British officials said London could not agree to Brussels'
demand to have ""a backstop to a backstop"", which would see the
EU's proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the bloc's customs
union if a new trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Britain has long said it wants an agreement on a future
relationship with the EU, which London sees as including a
common rule book for manufactured and agricultural products,
which would negate any need for a backstop plan for Ireland.
    But British negotiators also say they will honour a
commitment to a backstop. This year, the government suggested
Britain could apply the EU's external tariffs for a limited
period in case of any delay in implementing a Brexit deal.
    EU negotiators have criticised that proposal, and said on
Sunday it was clear that, as things stood, May did not feel she
could get a deal through her cabinet, which meets on Tuesday.
    EU officials and diplomats say they will ""keep calm and
carry on"", hoping May can sort out her problems in London. 
    British officials were optimistic of making some progress at
the EU summit this week, with foreign minister Jeremy Hunt
telling reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are one or two very
difficult outstanding issues but I think we can get there.
Whether we do this week or not, who knows? But I know everyone
is trying incredibly hard.""

    MADRID, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Spain's government trimmed growth
forecasts for this year and next on Monday as part of the 2019
budget proposal, mostly due to slowing exports, the Economy
Minister Nadia Calvino said.
    Spain's economic output has grown more than 3 percent each
year for the last three years and has been expanding ever since
it emerged from a 5-year economic slump in 2013.
    However, slowing exports, rising oil prices and political
uncertainties over trade are expected to weigh on the recovery
this year and next, Calvino said.
    The 2019 budget proposal, which will be sent to Brussels on
Monday, has been agreed between the minority Socialist
government and the anti-austerity party Podemos. 
    The proposal still needs support from regional parties in
parliament to be passed into law. [nL8N1WR24E]
    The government expects economic output to expand by 2.6
percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent,
and by 2.3 percent next year after a previous forecast of 2.4
percent, Calvino said. 
    The government left the budget deficit forecast unchanged
from targets set in July at 2.7 percent of gross domestic
product this year and 1.8 percent of GDP in 2019. 
    The proposal aims to raise the spending ceiling by 4.4
percent from a year earlier to 125.1 billion euros ($145
billion), the highest since 2015. 
    The budget aims to cut the unemployment rate, the second
highest in Europe after Greece, to 15.5 percent this year and
13.8 percent next year, compared with 15.3 percent recorded in
the second quarter.

    The central government surplus excludes the budgets of
social security funds and local administration. It differs from
the figure monitored by Greece's EU/IMF lenders but indicates
the state of the country's finances.
    Net tax revenue came in at 37.23 billion euros, 591 million
euros above target, while spending reached 36.93 billion euros,
1.54 million euros below target.
    The government projects a primary budget surplus of 3.8
percent of economic output this year, according to its 2018
budget. The bailout target is for a primary surplus of 3.5
percent of GDP.

    PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca <AZN.L> has suspended
investments in Britain due to the lack of clarity over the
country's departure from the European Union, the pharmaceutical
firm's non-executive chairman Leif Johansson told France's Le
Monde newspaper.
    British Prime Minister Theresa May was facing growing
pressure on Monday to rethink her plan for leaving the EU after
Brexit talks reached a stand-off at the weekend over
arrangements for the UK border with Ireland. [nL8N1WV31L]
    ""If a transition deal does not make clear what will happen
in the future, we will maintain our decision not to invest,"" Le
Monde quoted Johansson as saying in an interview.
    ""A Brexit agreement will need to ensure that Britain does
not become an isolated island in the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean,"" he added. 
    AstraZeneca has already spent 40 million pounds ($53
million) stockpiling medicines in Britain and continental Europe
to prevent supply disruptions if the two sides fail to reach a
withdrawal agreement. 
    Some pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca have
warned of medicine shortages in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit.
    More than 2,600 drugs have some part of their manufacturing
carried out in Britain. Britain exports some 45 million medical
packs to EU countries each month, industry figures show, while
37 million flow to Britain from the EU.
    France's largest drugmaker Sanofi <SASY.PA> said in August 
it would increase medicine stockpiles in Britain, echoing moves
made by GlaxoSmithKline <GSK.L>, Roche <ROG.S> and Novartis
<NOVN.S>.
    ""In business, uncertainty often forces you to make
decisions. But what is frustrating is to have to do so when the
existing system works very well,"" Johansson said. ""This is
costing us money and brings us no benefit.""

    PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A French government reshuffle,
expected since the resignation of the interior minister two
weeks ago, was postponed on Monday, an aide close to President
Emmanuel Macron said.
    The decision was due to deadly floods in the south of
France, which both Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe
were monitoring, the official said. [nL8N1WV1I6]
    The official could not say if the reshuffle, which Macron
hopes will allow him to draw a line under a difficult few
months, with three ministers having left the government since
the end of August, would take place before the weekly cabinet
meeting on Wednesday. 
    The new cabinet line-up, which had been expected shortly
after Gerard Collomb resigned as interior minister on Oct. 2,
has been portrayed as imminent for at least a week. 
    Opposition politicians say the delay shows that Macron's
political party, Republique En Marche, which was created barely
two years ago to prepare his bid for the presidency, is
struggling to attract candidates to join the government.
    After a positive first few months in office, Macron, 40, has
seen his popularity wane. Most opinion polls now put his
approval rating at barely 30 percent, less than half the level
shortly after he took office. 
    Opponents have been emboldened.
    ""Postponed again! It's not a government #reshuffle anymore,
it's a collapse: that of the President's authority,"" hard-left
leader Jean-Luc Melenchon tweeted.
    Macron and his government say he and Philippe are simply
taking the time needed to put together the right team.
    ""In any organisation ... you need to take the time to know
people, make sure you have the same mindset, check everything,""
Macron told France 24 and RFI television on Friday. 
    ""I'm doing things calmly,"" he said, adding that the
government was carrying on normally with its work.
    Philippe has taken on the interior portfolio on an interim
basis.

    AMSTERDAM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Dutch financial markets
regulator, already scrambling to process a flurry of relocation
requests from UK-based companies, will need about 10 percent
more staff to cope with the extra work caused by Brexit, sources
close to the matter told Reuters. 
    Amsterdam is competing with European Union cities including
Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin to attract business from London,
with all chalking up recent major relocation wins ahead of
Britain's departure from the EU in March.
    More than 20 trading firms have applied for licences to
relocate operations to Amsterdam. [nL5N1VZ2OA]
    The Dutch have also started hiring about 950 customs
officers, mostly at Rotterdam Port, Europe's largest, to prepare
for the extra bureaucracy required for British goods to enter
the EU if the two sides do not reach a withdrawal agreement. 
    The financial markets regulator, known by its Dutch acronym
AFM, is having trouble filling jobs as it pulls resources from
across the organisation to a dedicated Brexit team, the sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    The AFM, with an annual budget of nearly 100 million euros
($116 million) and 650 staff, on Monday declined to comment on
the details, but a spokesman said that if Brexit went ahead, the
regulator would need increased funding.
    The organisation will seek millions of euros to bolster its
budget during upcoming meetings with the finance ministry, one
of the sources said.
    ""It is unclear exactly what will happen and which trading
platforms will come to Amsterdam, but it has the potential to
have a huge impact on the European trading market,"" said
another. ""In any Brexit scenario, there will need to be a lot
more resources.""
    London has long dominated securities trading in the EU and
Britain’s counterpart to the AFM, the Financial Conduct
Authority, has 3,400 staff to ensure orderly markets.
    The first source said the AFM would need roughly 10 percent
more staff, or at least 60 full-time workers, to handle the
increased workload.
    Among major players in the process of setting up Dutch
operations are Chicago’s Cboe Global Markets <CBOE.O>,  the
London Stock Exchange Group <LSE.L>, Japan’s Norinchukin Bank
[NORB.UL] and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T>, as well
as U.S. firms Marketaxess <MKTX.O>, Jane Street and Tradeweb.
    The Netherlands, with strong UK trading ties, is more
economically exposed to Brexit than most EU countries. Gross
domestic product could be hurt by as much as 4 percentage points
by 2030 in the worst scenario, according to Rabobank forecasts.
    Brexit is set to force the EU to rethink its core securities
trading rules, known as MiFID II, which were introduced in
January, creating further demands on the bloc’s regulators. The
EU’s European Securities and Markets Authority, which oversees
securities markets in conjunction with national watchdogs like
the AFM, has repeatedly said it also needs more resources.

government bonds since March 2015, the ECB has been slowly
trimming back its purchases, hoping it has already done enough
to bolster growth and inflation.
    The gradual reduction in the amount of monthly stimulus has
persisted even with plenty of evidence that euro zone growth
momentum peaked a long while back, and with additional economic
and political risks mounting.
    Still, all 70 economists who answered an additional question
in the latest poll, taken before the Italian cabinet was due to
meet on Monday to discuss its 2019 budget, said chances that the
central bank would extend its bond buying programme were low.
    Italy's cabinet was expected to approve on Tuesday the
budget, which envisages a jump in the deficit that has upset
financial markets. [nL8N1WV1L6]
    The latest Reuters poll of more than 80 economists taken on
Oct 9-15 also found that euro zone inflation would languish
below the central bank's target until at least 2021. 
    ""The essence of the ECB's strategy is a gradual end of the
net asset purchases of QE by the end of the year and possibly a
first rate hike in September or October next year,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, chief economist at ING.
    ""However, it is currently far too early to answer these
questions. Why should the ECB unnecessarily commit itself? As
illustrated by the current market turmoil, and doubts about the
strength of the global economy, too much can happen between now
and the end of summer 2019.""
    Minutes from the central bank's September meeting released
on Thursday showed ECB policymakers remained optimistic.
[nL8N1WR3P0]
    With euro zone inflation forecast to average just 1.7
percent this year, next and in 2020, below the ECB's 2 percent
target ceiling, the central bank was still expected to raise
interest rates in the second half of next year.
    The deposit rate will rise 15 basis points to -0.25 percent
in the third quarter and the refinancing rate to 10 basis points
from the current zero percent in the final quarter of 2019,
according to the latest poll.
    ""The ECB is next due to provide further details on its
reinvestment process and perhaps update its forward guidance and
we expect it to sound dovish, but stay short of indicating that
it will actively try to lengthen the duration of its purchases
during the reinvestment phase,"" noted Ebrahim Rahbari, director
of the global economics team at Citi in New York.
    ""And despite a few recent hawkish noises, it remains very
unlikely that the ECB would consider a rate hike before
September 2019.""
    In the meantime, private business surveys suggest the
escalating trade war is already hurting factories across the
euro zone, with the September reading showing overall business
activity slowing to a four-month low. [EUR/PMIS]
    The euro zone economy is expected to grow at a steady 0.4
percent rate every quarter through to the end of next year.
    Growth will average 2.0 percent this year, slightly lower
than the 2.1 percent predicted last month, the consensus showed.
    That was in line with the International Monetary Fund's
growth projections, which downgraded its view from July on a
weaker performance by major euro zone countries. [nL2N1WP03N]
    Euro zone economic growth is seen at 1.8 percent next year
and at 1.6 percent in 2020, both unchanged from the previous
poll.
    When asked about the likelihood of a euro zone recession in
the next year, the median of 43 economists was 15 percent. For
the next two years, the figure was 25 percent, unchanged from
August's poll.
    Findings in the latest Reuters polls were not very different
for top economies in the region. Economists cut their growth
outlook for Germany, France and Italy from a July poll.

 (Adds background, quote, updates prices)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
dropped across the board on Tuesday, narrowing the spread over
German peers, after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
defended the country's deficit hiking budget, boosting hopes he
would stay on in government. 
    While Italy's expansionary budget, officially signed off on
Monday, likely sets up a showdown with Brussels, a lot of those
concerns were already priced in, so investors on Tuesday focused
on Tria's comments instead. 
    He said he was confident he could explain to the Commission
that Italy needed to raise spending to offset a slowing economy,
and described the 2.4 percent deficit target as ""normal"".
[nL8N1WV1L6]
    The economy minister is seen by investors as a key
moderating influence in government, particularly on the two
deputy prime ministers and main anti-establishment figures
Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio. 
    ""The most important reason (for the drop in yields) is that
Tria is continuing to stick to the government and defending the
budget, this is taken positively by the market,"" said DZ Bank
strategist Christian Lenk.     
    ""We have already priced in a lot of negative news on Italy,
so maybe for some investors it's starting to look interesting
again."" 
    Italian bond yields were down between five and 14 basis
points in early trade, with two-year yields 14 bps lower to a
one-week low of 1.60 percent and 10-year yields down eight bps
at 3.48 percent. <IT2YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR> 
    The closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread
tightened 11 basis points to 297 bps, moving further away from a
five-year peak of around 315 bps hit last week.  <IT10YT=RR>
<DE10YT=RR>
    Some large bond fund managers have said recently that the
higher Italian yields are proving attractive. 
    JPMorgan Asset Management's Nick Gartside was last week
reported as saying some of the funds within the group are
increasing exposure to Italian bonds. [nL8N1WR0V0]
    Other analysts attributed the drop in Italian yields to a
general improvement in risk sentiment, with world markets
calming a touch after the wild swings of last week. 
    Indeed, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields were also
lower on the day, albeit by only a basis point each. <ES10YT=RR>
<PT10YT=RR>     
    High-grade euro zone government bond yields were unchanged
on Tuesday, having dropped sharply over the past week on a bid
for safe assets. 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, was steady at 0.50 percent, hovering above two-week
lows of 0.478 percent hit on Monday. <DE10YT=RR> 
    This could drop lower after the ZEW research institute
releases its latest survey on German investor morale at 0900 GMT
if analysts are accurate in their expectation that the indicator
will edge down slightly.

263,984,1279,3096,2b2da78199028d0406f46275fbf94ada,FACTBOX-France's Emmanuel Macron reshuffles government: only one big move,2018-10-16 15:42:05,EUR,-0.09421,2018-10-16 15:42:50,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron,
whose government has been shaken by a spate of resignations and
whose popularity has fallen in the polls, reshuffled his cabinet
on Tuesday, moving a close ally into the Interior Ministry. 
    Most of the other moves were in less high-profile positions,
including a new agriculture minister and culture minister.
    Below our profiles of some of the major ministerial posts
after the reshuffle:
    
    PRIME MINISTER EDOUARD PHILIPPE, 47
    Philippe retains his job as prime minister. The former
conservative mayor of Le Havre was little known on the national
political scene until Macron plucked him from obscurity to lead
his government last year.
    His political experience has helped him in past weeks guide
Macron through a turbulent period that analysts say have exposed
the president's political rawness.
    Although a little more popular than Macron, the boxing fan's
 approval ratings in opinion polls have also fallen sharply in
past months. He served as head of public affairs for state
nuclear giant Areva between 2007 and 2010.
    
    CHRISTOPHE CASTANER, 52, MOVES TO INTERIOR MINISTRY
    The Provence-born former Socialist was one of Macron's
earliest backers, winning a place in the president's inner
circle during the campaign.
    After a few months as the government's spokesman, Castaner
was named as leader of Macron's fledgling Republique En Marche
party. He has spearheaded Macron's efforts to forge alliances
with like-minded parties across Europe ahead of European
Parliament elections next year.
    Castaner moves to the Interior Ministry, taking over from
Gerard Collomb, whose resignation earlier this month gave rise
to the reshuffle. The post is a sensitive one; in moving
Castaner into it, Macron rewards a close ally while keeping
someone he trusts in a critical, senior portfolio.
       
    JEAN-YVES LE DRIAN, 71, REMAINS AS FOREIGN MINISTER 
    One of the few career politicians in Macron's government, Le
Drian acquired a reputation as a safe pair of hands under the
previous Socialist administration, during which he served as
defense minister.
    A driving force behind France's counter-terrorism operations
in West Africa and the Middle East, he was also credited with
leading a resurgence in French weapons' exports, including the
first exports of the Rafale fighter jet.
    As foreign minister, he has kept a distinctly low profile,
refraining from the rhetoric often associated with French
diplomacy. The former university history teacher has spent over
35 years in politics and was president of the Brittany region.
    
    BRUNO LE MAIRE, 49, REMAINS AS FINANCE MINISTER
    Bruno Le Maire is a German-speaking centre-right politician
whose expertise on Europe and staunch defence of the
Franco-German relationship made him Macron's main negotiator
with the German government over his ambitious euro zone reform
plans.
    A reform-minded conservative, Le Maire has steered Macron's
drive to lighten the government touch on the economy and cut
red-tape, and is overseeing a push to privatise airports and
other state-controlled companies.
    A diplomat early in his career, Le Maire served as minister
under former president Nicolas Sarkozy and ran in The
Republicans party primary in the 2017 presidential race, but
scored poorly. He broke ranks with the conservatives after
publicly backing Macron the night he was elected president.
    He has written several novels, including one describing a
steamy scene between a minister and his wife in Venice.
    
    GERALD DARMANIN, 36, REMAINS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS MINISTER
    One of the youngest members in Macron's government at 36,
the conservative and former Sarkozy ally has become a rising
star in the cabinet. 
    His acute political sense, working-class background - he is
the son of a cleaning lady of Algerian descent - and reputation
as a plain speaker have made him popular with the public at a
time Macron faces accusations of being aloof and out of touch.
    As budget minister, he is in charge of overseeing Macron's
pledge to cut public spending and can claim credit for bringing
the budget deficit below the EU-mandated limit of 3 percent of
GDP last year, the first time in a decade for France.

    PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
reshuffled his government on Tuesday, naming loyalist and head
of his ruling party Christophe Castaner to the post of interior
minister.
    The reshuffle is an attempt to steady his administration
after a series of resignations and revive a reform drive that
has shown signs of flagging.
    In moving Castaner to the Interior Ministry, Macron has both
rewarded a close ally with a senior post, while keeping someone
he trusts in a critical portfolio. 
    It was the resignation earlier this month of interior
minister Gerard Collomb, an early backer of Macron, that
prompted the reshuffle.
    France's leader had been expected to announce the revamp
last week, but said he wanted to take more time to ensure the
right decisions were made. Opponents said that raised questions 
about the depth of experience in his party.
    An official in Macron's office described the new cabinet as
""dynamic"".
    ""We have both incoming names with a reputation in their
areas of expertise, which will strengthen the government's
efficiency, and others who have a broader profile,"" the official
said.  
    Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has spearheaded
Macron's euro zone reform push, and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves
Le Drian retained their posts.
    Most of the new appointments were in relatively less
high-profile positions, including a new agriculture minister,
culture minister and minister for overseas territories.

    By Danilo Masoni
    MILAN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday
helped by stronger defensive stocks as the focus turned to the
start of the reporting season which is expected to deliver
double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> index was up 0.4 percent
by 0834 GMT, after hitting a 22-month low in the previous
session on the back of risings U.S. Treasury yields and a mix of
geopolitical tensions. 
    Despite the bounce some caution remained after a turbulent
start of October that saw the STOXX 600 post on Friday its
biggest weekly loss since February. The index remains down 7.4
percent so far this year. 
    ""Investors are... struggling with the ongoing U.S.-China
trade war, Brexit talks, Italy's budget clash with Brussels, EM
slow down, and the most recent geopolitical tensions between
Saudi Arabia and the U.S.,"" said FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed. 
  
    Defensive and cheaply valued stocks such as utilities
<.SX6P> and telecoms <.SXKP> led sectoral gainers with Italian
utility Enel <ENEI.MI> up 3.4 percent and Germany's Deutsche
Telekom <DTEGn.DE> up 0.7 percent, while autos also rose
strongly despite emission woes hitting Volvo shares. 
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report
results this week with the earnings season passing its mid-point
during the first week of November.
    Overall, third-quarter earnings for the index are expected
to have risen 14 percent, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data,
while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That compares
to the 21.6 percent growth seen for U.S. companies.
    Meggitt <MGGT.L> was among the biggest gainers in Europe, up
5.6 percent after the engineering firm upgraded its 2018 organic
revenue growth guidance, boosted by higher demand for its
wheels, brakes, fuel tanks and other aeroplane parts.
[nL8N1WW12Z]
    Shares in other aero-defence stocks were also gaining:
Airbus <AIR.PA>, Safran <SAF.PA> and BAE Systems <BAES.L> all
rose between 1 and 2 percent.
    Bellway <BWY.L> also rose after the British housing
developer launched a cost savings program and reported a more
than 14 percent rise in full-year pre-tax profit. [nL3N1WW2J5]
    Other updates on Tuesday, however, disappointed investors.
    BAT <BATS.L> fell 1.3 percent after the world's
second-biggest tobacco company cut its full-year revenue target
for next-generation products, citing a flat market in Japan and
a product recall in the United States. [nL8N1WW15N]
    Merlin <MERL.L> lost 6.7 percent after its trading update
where the tourist group highlighted a disappointing summer
performance of its Legoland business. [nL8N1WW13N]
     Mapping company TomTom <TOM2.AS> fell 10 percent as worries
over the loss of a contract with Volvo overshadowed a strong
update. [nL8N1WW1LU]
    Volvo <VOLVb.ST> fell 5.3 percent after the Swedish company
warned that some truck engines could be exceeding emission
limits because a component was degrading more quickly than
expected. [nL8N1WW143]

    BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May's speech to the UK parliament on Monday has shown that
reaching a deal on the country's exit from the European Union
will be even harder than expected, a senior EU official said on
Tuesday.
    May urged the EU not to allow a stand-off over a 'backstop'
for Ireland to derail Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal
was still achievable. [nL8N1WV31L]
    Her speech and subsequent answers to lawmakers' questions
are not helping the process, the official said.
    ""They demonstrate that finding an agreement will be even
more difficult than one could have expected,"" the official said.
    A summit of EU leaders this week will decide if there is
enough progress for another summit on Brexit in November, the
official said.
    The 27 countries remaining in the bloc after Britain's exit
at the end of March 2019 insist that the economic part of May's
plans for future relations with the EU will not work, the
official said.

    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister
Theresa May will discuss Brexit with her ministers on Tuesday,
under pressure to rethink her plans from both some members of
her Conservative Party and the European Union.
    A day before May heads to Brussels for a summit, a senior EU
official again made clear that parts of May's plan could not
work and said the time was right to step up plans for Britain
leaving the bloc without a deal. [nB5N1U601F]
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU,
Brexit talks have reached a stalemate over the so-called Irish
backstop, a fallback plan to ensure there is no return to a hard
border between Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
    May told parliament on Monday she would not accept the EU's
proposal for such a backstop because, she said, it could break
up the United Kingdom.
    On Tuesday, a German official repeated the EU's line that
the backstop needed to be legally watertight and without it
there would be no Brexit deal. [nL8N1WV31L] [nS8N1UL000]
    Germany's European Affairs Minister Michael Roth offered
this advice to May: ""Take responsibility and be constructive.""
    But other ministers arriving in Luxembourg for a meeting of
EU ministers pointed to the progress made so far in the Brexit
talks.
    May will update her cabinet of top ministers on the Brexit
negotiations later on Tuesday, aware that some have come under
pressure from Conservative eurosceptic lawmakers to persuade her
to change tack over her so-called Chequers plan.
    Eight of those ministers, some with concerns over Chequers
and plans for a backstop, met late on Monday over pizza to
discuss Brexit, the Telegraph newspaper reported, after reports
that some may resign if May presses ahead.
    May has so far shown little sign of moving away from the
proposal for future ties hashed out at her country residence,
and tried to make clear to lawmakers on Monday that the issue
was now over the backstop - part of Britain's withdrawal terms.
    Talks with the EU reached a stalemate on Sunday, increasing
the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which, some companies say,
could disrupt trade, delay the movement of goods and starve the
world's fifth largest economy of investment.
    EU and British officials suggest it is unlikely that there
will be any agreement on the backstop at this week's summit, but
both are hopeful that progress can be made. 
    ""Even if in this week's debate we are not going to have any
kind of deal, there is still time, there is still possibility to
get a deal,"" Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in
Luxembourg.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Slovenia needs to increase its
productivity in order to be able to raise wages, the
government's macroeconomic institute UMAR said on Tuesday,
suggesting it will advise the government against general wage
hikes without such growth.
    Demand for higher wages has grown in the last year,
particularly in the public sector, partly due to the European
Union member's strong economic growth.
    The institute expects the Slovenian economy to grow 4.4
percent this year after 2017's 4.9 percent expansion, boosted by
higher exports, investments and household spending.
    But productivity in relatively low in Slovenia compared with
elsewhere in the EU.
    ""Slovenia lags behind the average EU productivity by 20
percent. We need to introduce good practices ... to achieve
higher value added and thus enable higher wages,"" the head of
the institute, Bostjan Vasle, told a conference on wages.
    UMAR, which does not represent the government's official
position, also suggested some wages could rise if the government
makes its wage policy more flexible so that people get paid in
line with the results of their labour.
    Police in Slovenia went on strike earlier in October to
demand wage hikes of about 15 percent, and several other public
sector trade unions are threatening industrial action, including
nurses and teachers. [nL8N1WH29V]
    The previous, centre-left government said earlier this year
that the public trade unions' combined wage hike demands
amounted to about 1 billion euros, which was not acceptable. It
did not complete wage talks at that time due to early elections
in June.
    Public sector trade unions resumed their demands for higher
wages as soon as the new minority centre-left government under
Prime Minister Marjan Sarec took power in September. 
    Vasle said public sector wages represent about 25 percent of
budget spending, meaning significant changes to those wages have
a big influence on the budget and the country's fiscal position.
    Slovenia hopes to run a budget surplus of about 0.4 percent
of economic output this year and 0.2 percent in 2019 after eking
out a 0.03 percent surplus in 2017.
    That should make it possible for the country to gradually
reduce the high public debt that built up in the years before a
banking crisis in 2013, when it only narrowly avoided having to
ask for an international bailout.
    The public debt is seen falling to 66.6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2019 from some 70 percent this year,
Finance Minister Andrej Bertoncelj said last week. [nL8N1WR47N]
While on a downward trajectory, that is still above the target
ceiling of 60 percent of GDP set by the EU.

leaders Donald Tusk said he hoped EU governments can still make
visible progress in reforming the single currency area by
December despite a eurosceptic government in Italy that wants to
break EU budget rules.
    ""I hope that positive progress is still possible and that is
why I decided to organise the euro summit,"" Tusk told a news
conference on Tuesday, referring to a meeting on Thursday in
Brussels devoted to euro zone reform.
    The populist government in Rome presented its draft budget
for 2019 to the European Commission on Monday proposing a budget
deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, three times as high as the number
agreed with the Commission by the previous Italian government.
    The Commission has said such a draft budget plan would
significantly depart from the agree fiscal path and is likely to
send the draft back to Rome asking it to be revised.
    At the same time the 19 countries sharing the euro want to
integrate more deeply in economic terms, by giving more powers
to their bailout fund ESM, setting up a euro zone budget and a
euro zone-wide deposit insurance scheme.
    The consent of Italy, the euro zone's third biggest economy,
is necessary for the process to go forward. EU leaders have been
aiming to find an agreement on the reforms in December. 
    ""Of course we have to be realistic and frank. I am
absolutely aware that the atmosphere is more tricky than in
June, but I think we can use the time before December to clarify
the position of some member states and our goal remains to have
visible progress in December,"" Tusk said.

union will stage a 24-hour walkout on November 14 to demand wage
and pension increases, hirings and tax cuts, the first major
strike since the country exited its bailout programme in August.
    Greeks have endured years of punishing austerity including
tax hikes and deep spending cuts in return for international
loans since its debt crisis erupted in 2009.
    The left-led government, which faces elections next year,
has promised to keep tight control of public finances after the
end of the bailout, raising the stakes in its standoff with the
ADEDY labour union that has organised the strike.
    ""Now that we've become a normal country with a normal
government which is no longer supervised by foreign powers, now
is the time to try to solve some of the problems created in the
past eight years,"" ADEDY president Yannis Paidas told Reuters. 
    ""Public sector workers want their dignity back, we need to
recoup some of our losses.""
    ADEDY represents about half a million workers but turnout in
protests has been low in recent years.  
    Even though the bailout has ended, Greece will be loath to
go on a spending spree any time soon - it still has to generate
high budget surpluses under a post-bailout surveilance plan
agreed with the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
    The strike will also be against privatisations and the
evaluation process of public sector workers, ADEDY said.
    Greece's private sector union GSEE is also mulling a strike
but has not yet decided on a possible date.
    The economy shrank by about a quarter during the eight-year
crisis. It has now returned to growth and the jobless rate has
dropped to 19 percent from a record high of nearly 28 percent in
2013, but is still the highest in the euro zone. 
    The government, which signed up to a new bailout in 2015
despite pre-election promises to end austerity, has pledged to
protect workers and pensioners from any further cuts, but
without derailing the country's fiscal performance. 
    It submitted its first post-bailout budget to parliament
this month pending approval by its lenders. [nL8N1WH601]

    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European Council President
Donald Tusk said on Tuesday he will ask British Prime Minister
Theresa May this week if she has new ideas on how to break the
impasse in Brexit talks, adding that he has become less
optimistic about an immediate breakthrough.
    Tusk told reporters his hopes for their meeting on Wednesday
had been dampened by European Union Brexit negotiator Michel
Barnier, as well as events in the British parliament.
    ""Unfortunately the report on the state of the negotiations
that I got from Michel Barnier today, as well as yesterday's
debate in the House of Commons, give me no grounds for optimism
before tomorrow's European Council on Brexit,"" said Tusk, who
will chair the EU summit in Brussels.
    A breakthrough required more than just goodwill. ""Tomorrow,
I'm going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete
proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can
determine if a breakthrough is possible,"" he said.
    EU leaders, meeting from Wednesday evening, had hoped to
reach a provisional deal over Britain's exit from the EU in
March before signing off on a withdrawal agreement at a special
Brexit summit in November. 
    Tusk said the November meeting would make sense only if
there were a feeling of being really close to a breakthrough.
    The talks are stuck over the issue of the border between the
British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and
have not resumed since Sunday.
    Tusk likened the issue to the Gordian Knot, cut in legend by
Alexander the Great, saying ""It is not so easy to find this kind
of creative leader.""
    Leaders, he said, would step up their preparations for a
no-deal Brexit. ""A no-deal scenario becomes more likely than
ever before, but it doesn't mean it is our political priority.""

    * But he faces calls to quit after Bavaria election flop
    * SPD blames CSU for ruling coalition's poor image

 (adds pressure for him to go)
    By Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
leading critic in her coalition government said on Tuesday he
wanted the ruling alliance to work, batting away calls for his
own resignation after a dismal result for his party in Bavaria's
regional election.
    Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social
Union (CSU), has been a thorn in Merkel's side since 2015, with
criticism of her decision to open German borders to almost
onemillion refugees, most of them fleeing war in the Middle
East.
    But the CSU's disastrous performance on Sunday - its weakest
since 1950 - has raised questions about whether he should stand
down as party leader and interior minister in the national
government.
    The calls grew louder on Tuesday, with a senior member of
the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in
Merkel's coalition, calling Seehofer ""miscast"" as interior
minister and a senior CSU figure suggesting he should step down.
    Seehofer dismissed the idea of resigning, telling a news
conference his work in politics ""is fun"". He said the CSU,
sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), would
act as a stable force in her ruling 'grand' coalition.
    ""I have no inclination at all for minority governments, or
fresh elections and everything that can come with them,"" he
added.
    ""This grand coalition must simply get on with reputable work
and communicate it properly.In the CSU, we will do everything
for the grand coalition to stay,"" Seehofer said.
    Thomas Oppermann, a senior member of the SPD, described
Horst Seehofer as behaving like a ""hooligan"" as interior
minister and said he was miscast in that role.
    The CSU leader was to blame for the ruling coalition's poor
image, he said.
    
    PITFALLS AHEAD
    CSU honourary chairman Theo Waigel also suggested Seehofer
should go: ""Everyone has to decide for themselves how to make a
graceful, personally responsible departure from politics,"" he
told the Ausburger Allgemeine.
    Before the Bavaria vote, the CSU pushed the coalition -
Merkel's fourth and probably final government - close to
collapsing twice, first in an argument over immigration and then
in a scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster.
    The CDU/CSU conservative alliance only teamed up with the
SPD to form the ruling coalition in March following an
inconclusive national election and the collapse of negotiations
between the conservatives and two smaller parties.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
join the government after promising before the 2017 election to
sit in opposition if they lost to the conservatives. They are
now demanding consequences.
    The leader of the SPD's Jusos youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert,
said his party should give the conservatives an ultimatum:
achieve progress on issues such as policy on diesel cars and
reducing arms exports, or else the SPD quits the government.
    ""Deal or no deal, that must be the clear message to the
Union parties,"" he told the Handelsblatt business daily,
referring to the CDU/CSU alliance.
    Merkel, who has been in office since 2005 and is Europe's
most powerful leader, faces further potential pitfalls this year
in the form of a CDU conclave and the party's annual congress in
  early December.
    The chancellor, 64, has won support from key conservatives
in her bid for re-election as CDU chairwoman at the congress.
But this could change if the CDU loses power in the western
region of Hesse in another state election on Oct. 28.

in the economy and raising the level of competitiveness,""
Charlotte Ruhe, EBRD Managing Director for Central and South
Eastern Europe, said in an interview during a visit to
Ljubljana.
    She welcomed the fact that the new centre-left government,
which took power in September, has already started privatising
state-owned banks Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Abanka, adding she
expected further selloffs in the coming years.
    Ruhe, after holding meetings with government officials, said
the government was likely to sell some tourism firms and could
start privatisation of the largest telecoms operator, Telekom
Slovenia, in the second half of 2019. 
    She also said the government would have to reform the
pension system to ease the burden of a rapidly ageing population
on the state budget, giving no further details.
    Earlier on Tuesday the government's macroeconomic institute
UMAR said Slovenia should increase productivity in order to be
able to meet public sector unions' demands for higher wages.

Xavier Bettel will seek to re-form his liberal-led coalition
after an election on Sunday gave the three ruling parties just
enough seats to remain in government.
    Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri asked Bettel to form the next
government on Tuesday, noting in a statement that Bettel's
Democratic Party, the Socialist Workers Party (LSAP) and the
Greens had expressed a desire to start coalition negotiations.
    Opinion polls before Sunday's election had indicated the
Christian Social People's Party (CSV) - which was led for 19
years by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker - would end
Bettel's five-year term as prime minister.
    The CSV was again the largest party, but actually lost
seats, as did the LSAP and the Democratic Party. However,
because the Greens gained, the three parties in government have
31 seats in the 60-seat chamber. [nL8N1WU0CZ]
    The CSV was pushed out of government for only the second
time since World War Two in a snap election Juncker called in
2013 after a wire-tapping scandal.
    Unlike some neighbouring countries, where migration has
boosted anti-immigrant parties, the far right has not made
inroads in Luxembourg.
    However, in 2015 Luxembourgers decisively rejected giving
the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreigners,
mostly from Portugal, France and other EU countries.
    Whatever the future government, the foreign policy of the
European Union's wealthiest but second-smallest state is
unlikely to change much.

    CARACAS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Venezuela is seeking to open
bank accounts in Asia and Europe to carry out hard currency
transactions, Economy Vice President Tareck El Aissami said on
Tuesday, as the OPEC nation seeks to overcome U.S. sanctions
that have hurt its foreign commerce.
    Hyperinflation-stricken Venezuela is in its fifth year of
recession, prompting a surge in emigration that has overwhelmed
its South American neighbors. [nL2N1WO15T]
    President Nicolas Maduro frequently blames a U.S. ""economic
war"" for Venezuela's chronic shortages of food, medicine and
other basic goods. Critics attribute the crisis to Maduro's
policies, including a complex web of currency controls and heavy
state intervention in the economy.
    ""The President has instructed the finance minister to begin
a new correspondence scheme in Europe and Asia for public
banks,"" El Aissami said. 
    He added that the government will sell 2 billion euros 
($2.32 billion) on its Dicom foreign exchange platform starting
in November or December, without describing the time frame. 
Official statistics show the government has sold just $75
million through Dicom auctions this year.    
     Cash-strapped Venezuela's reserves are at a 20-year low at
$8.825 billion, two-thirds of which are held in gold bars. 
    The euros would come from oil revenues, El Aissami said,
without providing a detailed breakdown. 
    In August, Maduro devalued the bolivar currency by 96
percent, hiked taxes and raised the minimum wage. But the moves
have not dented inflation, which the International Monetary Fund
forecasts at 1.4 million percent this year and 10 million
percent next year. [nL1N1V900V][nL2N1WP0KA]

    PHNOM PENH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A European Union decision to
ramp up trade pressure on Cambodia has alarmed unions in its
garment industry, a pillar of the economy that employs about
700,000 people, but a key grouping of manufacturers said the
risk would take months to materialise.
    Cambodia's biggest export market, the EU, warned this month
that the Southeast Asian nation would lose special access to the
world's largest trading bloc, in a punitive response to its move
away from democracy. [nL8N1WL2JW]
    Some Western countries have criticised a July election won
by Prime Minister Hun Sen, calling it flawed, because of a
campaign of intimidation by his allies, and the lack of a
credible opposition dissolved by the Supreme Court.
    The repercussions could devastate garment exports that
account for about 40 percent of Cambodia's gross domestic
product (GDP), and industries such as sugar.
    ""The European market is an important one,"" said At Thon, the
president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers'
Democratic Union.
    ""If factories close their doors, it will be hard."" 
    Cambodia's factories supply global brands, such as Gap Inc
<GPS.N>, Swedish fashion brand H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB
<HMb.ST>, and sportswear brands Nike <NKE.N>, Puma and Adidas
<ADSGn.DE>, among others.
    Cambodia's exports to the European Union, under its
""Everything but Arms"" (EBA) scheme, were worth 5 billion euros
($5.8 billion) last year, EU data show.
    Although Hun Sen vowed to defend Cambodia's sovereignty in
the wake of the EU announcement, some union leaders fear workers
already grappling with personal debt could see bank balances
plunge further into the red. [nL4N1WO0LP] 
    ""Workers borrow some money to build houses for their parents
or do other businesses,"" Sia Kunthea, president of the Cambodia
Women Labor Union Federation, told Reuters. 
    The European Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia is seriously
concerned about the possibility of trade preferences being
withdrawn, it told the European Commission this week.
    ""We would suggest a different course of action to foster the
EU's core values, through cooperation activities rather than by
implementing a suspension or sanctions,"" the body representing
the private sector, said in a letter.
    
    PRODUCERS OPTIMISTIC
    Cambodia's $7-billion apparel industry is the largest formal
employer among a population of 15 million.
    ""It will be difficult if the EBA is suspended,"" said Hoeun
Tharith, 42, a shoe factory worker and father of three, adding
that he shrank from the consequences of losing his monthly
income of about $210.    
    Yet the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia
(GMAC), which represents 600 factories, is optimistic.
    The threat of tariffs was still months away and would be the
subject of a six-month EU review, said Kaing Monika, the
grouping's deputy secretary general. 
    ""At this point, nobody can guarantee what the outcome will
be and whether it will result in a substantial loss,"" Kaing
Monika told Reuters. 
    ""What we are more concerned about is the media speculation
leading to reduced confidence from buyers and investors ... the
actual situation might be much less frightening.""
    Some say it is too soon to tell if buyers will pull out and
turn to lower-cost Asian rivals.
    Sweden's H&M, which sources from 62 factories in Cambodia,
said it understood the need to look into the rights situation,
but urged the European Union to also weigh the impact on
workers.
    ""Potential negative effects on the employment for the people
in the garment industry must be taken into consideration,"" it
said in a statement to Reuters, without saying if it planned to
pull out of Cambodia.
    Costs are lower in neighbouring Vietnam, another
garment-making hub, where the minimum wage ranges from $114 to
$165.
    This advantage will only improve after a hike of seven
percent takes effect in Cambodia's textiles and footwear
industry in January, pushing the corresponding figure to $182.
    ""Of course if companies move Vietnam might benefit a little
bit,"" Dang Phuong Dung, a former official of the Vietnam Textile
and Apparel Association, told Reuters.

    By Aaron Ross
    DAKAR, Oct 17 (Reuters) - When Central African Republic
(CAR) pleaded for help last year to fight marauding militias,
former colonial ruler France offered guns it had seized off
Somalia. But Russia objected and donated its own weapons
instead.
    By early February, Russia had sent nine planes with weapons
along with dozens of contractors to train local soldiers and
secure mining projects, marking the start of its highest-profile
military foray in sub-Saharan Africa for decades.
    Muscling in on a country dominated by France for years
served as a statement of intent about Moscow's renewed push for
global prestige and influence, and is part of a wider campaign
shaking up long-standing power dynamics on the continent.
    Since Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea
in 2014, Moscow has signed 19 military cooperation deals in
sub-Saharan Africa, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe, according to its foreign and defence ministries and
state media.
    The continent's 54 member states at the United Nations –
three of which sit on the Security Council at any given time –
 form the organisation's largest voting bloc and one of its most
coherent, making them attractive allies for Russia. 
    ""The West is not very much loved by many countries. And many
(see) Russia as the country that will oppose the West,"" said
Dmitri Bondarenko, an anthropologist and historian at Russia's
Institute for African Studies.
    Besides sending arms and contractors to CAR, Russian
national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to President
Faustin-Archange Touadera and Russia's defence ministry said
last week it planned to establish a five-person team at CAR's
defence ministry.
    Russia's moves come at a time when the defence ministry's
influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing against a
backdrop of heightened tension with the West. [nL8N1WL4IY] 
    
    SEIZED WEAPONS
    When CAR made its plea in 2017, there was recognition that a
spike in ethnic fighting could turn into a far larger conflict
and that its security forces were too weak to tackle myriad
armed groups. [nL8N1LP2QI]
    CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons
shipments must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR
sanctions committee, made up of the Council's 15 members,
including France and Russia. It operates by consensus.
    France first offered to help CAR buy old weapons but the
proposal was too expensive. France then offered 1,400 AK47
assault rifles it had seized off Somalia in 2016, according to a
Security Council memo and four diplomats.
    Russia objected on the grounds that weapons seized for
breaching the U.N. arms embargo on Somalia could not be recycled
for use in another country under embargo, two diplomats said.
    But mindful of the need for a quick solution, the sanctions
committee approved Moscow's donation of AK47s, sniper rifles,
machineguns and grenade launchers in December, according to
committee documents and diplomats.
    ""We presented our problem and Russia offered to help us,
subject to Security Council approval,"" said Albert Yaloke
Mokpeme, CAR's presidential spokesman. ""If peace is restored
tomorrow in CAR, I think everyone will be happy.""
    Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for
comment about committee proceedings. 
    France's foreign ministry said Russia must strictly respect
the terms of its arms embargo exemption to keep the weapons out
of the wrong hands.
    
    'WE'RE NOT INTERESTED'
    During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged close military
and diplomatic ties with many African countries. It was involved
in proxy wars in states such as Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique
and helped independence movements fight Western colonial powers.
    Russia is now trying to revive some of the relationships
that lapsed after the Soviet Union's collapse. It joins a number
of countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates looking
to set up bases in Africa, mediate in diplomatic stand-offs and
strike business deals. [nL5N1UT0GU] [nL8N1MB0CN]
    China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but
it has shied away from any military involvement. It did go a
step further last year, however, opening its first military base
outside China in Djibouti. 
    Near the world's busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also
home to a large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an
Italian camp and Japan's only overseas base.
    Djibouti blocked Russian attempts to set up a base, however,
saying it wanted to avoid becoming the terrain for a proxy war.
Moscow is now planning to build a logistics centre at a port in
neighbouring Eritrea. [nR4N1VI01N]
    While France has a military bases outside Djibouti in former
colonies Gabon, Ivory Coast and Senegal and its soldiers also
operate in Chad, Mali and Niger, analysts say Washington's
influence is on the wane. 
    Its trade with the continent has halved in the past decade,
though much of that is due to U.S. shale replacing oil imports
from Africa. Diplomatic posts have gone unfilled and a task
force based in CAR tracking warlord Joseph Kony left last year.
    ""Our actions on the diplomatic and military side have sent a
huge signal to our partners that we're not interested in
Africa,"" said Donald Bolduc, who commanded U.S. special forces
across the continent until last year.
    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor
Nagy said Washington's commitment to Africa was unwavering but,
""there is space for other countries to play a positive role in
the region"".
    
    AFRICAN DEALS
    As part of Russia's renewed push, Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in March, attended a
summit in South Africa in June and visited Rwanda, chair of the
African Union, this year.
    Russia has also struck military cooperation deals with many
African countries since 2015, though some have yet to come into
force. The agreements typically involve providing weapons and
training in areas such as counter-terrorism and piracy.
[nL8N1WQ54N]
    Analysts caution that the deals often appear more symbolic
than transformative and say it's not clear if Russia has the
resources, or desire, to continue expanding its presence.
    But as in the Cold War, military deals can come alongside
economic links, such as mining and energy agreements. Ethiopia
signed its deal in April, a month after Lavrov visited to
discuss nuclear energy, agriculture and transportation projects.
    Russian firms have signed mineral deals in Sudan, which
cooperates with Moscow in defence technology, and Russia is
looking at diamond and platinum projects in Zimbabwe as well as
energy projects in Chad. [nL5N1QQ30K]
    Over the past decade, Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa
has increased fast, albeit from a low base. From 2010-2017,
total trade rose to $4.2 billion a year from $1.6 billion,
according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies https://www.csis.org.
 
    During the same period, China's total trade with sub-Saharan
Africa nearly doubled to $165 billion while U.S. trade more than
halved to $37 billion.
    
    WAGNER GROUP
    Since arriving in CAR, the Russians' remit has expanded
beyond military advice and into various economic and diplomatic
activities, a Western diplomat and security source said,
fuelling the beginnings of a Western backlash.
    In August, France, the United Kingdom and the United States
blocked a Russian request to send more weapons. The U.S. mission
to the United Nations said in a note to the sanctions committee
that it was awaiting, ""confirmation that measures had been taken
to ensure the secure management of the previous donation"".
    Estimates of the number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from
250 to 1,000. Touadera's spokesman declined to provide details,
nor say what activities the Russians were engaged in. 
    Yevgeny Shabayev, head of a chapter of a paramilitary
Cossack organisation who has ties to Russian security
contractors, said there could be 1,000 in CAR and 5,000 to
10,000 across Africa, including in Sudan, South Sudan and Libya.
    One Russian private military contractor, the Wagner group,
was thrust into the spotlight in July when three Russian
journalists were killed in CAR while investigating its alleged
presence there. [nL5N1UR790]
    Reuters has been unable to confirm whether Wagner
contractors are in CAR. People with ties to the group have told
Reuters it has carried out clandestine combat missions on the
Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine and Syria.
    Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their
orders. They have denied any role in the journalists' deaths. 
    Russia has also stepped into negotiations with militias in
CAR, adding to Western misgivings about its presence.
    According to a U.N. panel of experts, Touadera's Russian
adviser has met militia leaders several times to discuss
disarmament and the distribution of natural resources revenue.
    Russia said in August after brokering talks between armed
groups that Touadera had expressed gratitude for its involvement
and that it intended to continue its mediation.
    Reuters was unable to contact the adviser, Zakharov, for
comment. 
    ""There is a real division between that guy and the rest of
the presidential advisers,"" the security source said. ""When you
ask, 'Can we see your colleague?' they say, 'Who, our colleague?
We don't know him'.""

    * Russia supplied weapons and contractors to CAR in 2018
    * Russia had objected to French proposal to help CAR forces
    * Russia one of several countries seeking footholds in
Africa
    * Russian military deals in Africa since 2014: [nL8N1WQ54N]

    By Aaron Ross
    DAKAR, Oct 17 (Reuters) - When Central African Republic
(CAR) pleaded for help last year to fight marauding militias,
former colonial ruler France offered guns it had seized off
Somalia. But Russia objected and donated its own weapons
instead.
    By early February, Russia had sent nine planes with weapons
along with dozens of contractors to train local soldiers and
secure mining projects, marking the start of its highest-profile
military foray in sub-Saharan Africa for decades.
    Muscling in on a country dominated by France for years
served as a statement of intent about Moscow's renewed push for
global prestige and influence, and is part of a wider campaign
shaking up long-standing power dynamics on the continent.
    Since Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea
in 2014, Moscow has signed 19 military cooperation deals in
sub-Saharan Africa, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe, according to its foreign and defence ministries and
state media.
    The continent's 54 member states at the United Nations –
three of which sit on the Security Council at any given time –
 form the organisation's largest voting bloc and one of its most
coherent, making them attractive allies for Russia. 
    ""The West is not very much loved by many countries. And many
(see) Russia as the country that will oppose the West,"" said
Dmitri Bondarenko, an anthropologist and historian at Russia's
Institute for African Studies.
    Besides sending arms and contractors to CAR, Russian
national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to President
Faustin-Archange Touadera and Russia's defence ministry said
last week it planned to establish a five-person team at CAR's
defence ministry.
    Russia's moves come at a time when the defence ministry's
influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing against a
backdrop of heightened tension with the West. [nL8N1WL4IY] 
    
    SEIZED WEAPONS
    When CAR made its plea in 2017, there was recognition that a
spike in ethnic fighting could turn into a far larger conflict
and that its security forces were too weak to tackle myriad
armed groups. [nL8N1LP2QI]
    CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons
shipments must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR
sanctions committee, made up of the Council's 15 members,
including France and Russia. It operates by consensus.
    France first offered to help CAR buy old weapons but the
proposal was too expensive. France then offered 1,400 AK47
assault rifles it had seized off Somalia in 2016, according to a
Security Council memo and four diplomats.
    Russia objected on the grounds that weapons seized for
breaching the U.N. arms embargo on Somalia could not be recycled
for use in another country under embargo, two diplomats said.
    But mindful of the need for a quick solution, the sanctions
committee approved Moscow's donation of AK47s, sniper rifles,
machineguns and grenade launchers in December, according to
committee documents and diplomats.
    ""We presented our problem and Russia offered to help us,
subject to Security Council approval,"" said Albert Yaloke
Mokpeme, CAR's presidential spokesman. ""If peace is restored
tomorrow in CAR, I think everyone will be happy.""
    Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for
comment about committee proceedings. 
    France's foreign ministry said Russia must strictly respect
the terms of its arms embargo exemption to keep the weapons out
of the wrong hands.
    
    'WE'RE NOT INTERESTED'
    During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged close military
and diplomatic ties with many African countries. It was involved
in proxy wars in states such as Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique
and helped independence movements fight Western colonial powers.
    Russia is now trying to revive some of the relationships
that lapsed after the Soviet Union's collapse. It joins a number
of countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates looking
to set up bases in Africa, mediate in diplomatic stand-offs and
strike business deals. [nL5N1UT0GU] [nL8N1MB0CN]
    China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but
it has shied away from any military involvement. It did go a
step further last year, however, opening its first military base
outside China in Djibouti. 
    Near the world's busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also
home to a large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an
Italian camp and Japan's only overseas base.
    Djibouti blocked Russian attempts to set up a base, however,
saying it wanted to avoid becoming the terrain for a proxy war.
Moscow is now planning to build a logistics centre at a port in
neighbouring Eritrea. [nR4N1VI01N]
    While France has a military bases outside Djibouti in former
colonies Gabon, Ivory Coast and Senegal and its soldiers also
operate in Chad, Mali and Niger, analysts say Washington's
influence is on the wane. 
    Its trade with the continent has halved in the past decade,
though much of that is due to U.S. shale replacing oil imports
from Africa. Diplomatic posts have gone unfilled and a task
force based in CAR tracking warlord Joseph Kony left last year.
    ""Our actions on the diplomatic and military side have sent a
huge signal to our partners that we're not interested in
Africa,"" said Donald Bolduc, who commanded U.S. special forces
across the continent until last year.
    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor
Nagy said Washington's commitment to Africa was unwavering but,
""there is space for other countries to play a positive role in
the region"".
    
    AFRICAN DEALS
    As part of Russia's renewed push, Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in March, attended a
summit in South Africa in June and visited Rwanda, chair of the
African Union, this year.
    Russia has also struck military cooperation deals with many
African countries since 2015, though some have yet to come into
force. The agreements typically involve providing weapons and
training in areas such as counter-terrorism and piracy.
[nL8N1WQ54N]
    Analysts caution that the deals often appear more symbolic
than transformative and say it's not clear if Russia has the
resources, or desire, to continue expanding its presence.
    But as in the Cold War, military deals can come alongside
economic links, such as mining and energy agreements. Ethiopia
signed its deal in April, a month after Lavrov visited to
discuss nuclear energy, agriculture and transportation projects.
    Russian firms have signed mineral deals in Sudan, which
cooperates with Moscow in defence technology, and Russia is
looking at diamond and platinum projects in Zimbabwe as well as
energy projects in Chad. [nL5N1QQ30K]
    Over the past decade, Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa
has increased fast, albeit from a low base. From 2010-2017,
total trade rose to $4.2 billion a year from $1.6 billion,
according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies https://www.csis.org.
 
    During the same period, China's total trade with sub-Saharan
Africa nearly doubled to $165 billion while U.S. trade more than
halved to $37 billion.
    
    WAGNER GROUP
    Since arriving in CAR, the Russians' remit has expanded
beyond military advice and into various economic and diplomatic
activities, a Western diplomat and security source said,
fuelling the beginnings of a Western backlash.
    In August, France, the United Kingdom and the United States
blocked a Russian request to send more weapons. The U.S. mission
to the United Nations said in a note to the sanctions committee
that it was awaiting, ""confirmation that measures had been taken
to ensure the secure management of the previous donation"".
    Estimates of the number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from
250 to 1,000. Touadera's spokesman declined to provide details,
nor say what activities the Russians were engaged in. 
    Yevgeny Shabayev, head of a chapter of a paramilitary
Cossack organisation who has ties to Russian security
contractors, said there could be 1,000 in CAR and 5,000 to
10,000 across Africa, including in Sudan, South Sudan and Libya.
    One Russian private military contractor, the Wagner group,
was thrust into the spotlight in July when three Russian
journalists were killed in CAR while investigating its alleged
presence there. [nL5N1UR790]
    Reuters has been unable to confirm whether Wagner
contractors are in CAR. People with ties to the group have told
Reuters it has carried out clandestine combat missions on the
Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine and Syria.
    Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their
orders. They have denied any role in the journalists' deaths. 
    Russia has also stepped into negotiations with militias in
CAR, adding to Western misgivings about its presence.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
firmly tell Theresa May it is up to her to sort out divisions in
her own government over Brexit when she addresses them before
their summit dinner in Brussels tonight. Officials said they
expect the leaders to tell May they have little more to offer
since talks stalled on Sunday and they will step up preparations
for Britain to drop out of the EU with no deal. That being said,
media reports suggest EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said he
is ready to offer Britain a one-year extension of the transition
period due to end in December 2020 if it helps seal a
post-Brexit trade deal between the two sides. That of course
does not address the current sticking point of talks - the Irish
border wrangle - but will be held up by the EU side as proof of
its flexibility. Trade Minister Liam Fox also argues a longer
transition period will be required, The Times reports this
morning. 
    The EU's efforts to get a new all-encompassing treaty on its
ties with Switzerland look to be heading for failure, meanwhile.
Negotiations have in many ways mirrored those with the UK - in
Switzerland's case, labour rules protecting its high-wage model
from outside competition have rubbed up against the bloc's
internal market rules, notably on the free movement of people. 
Four years of negotiations have failed to produce a breakthrough
by the EU's mid-October deadline, with yesterday's talks also
ending in stalemate. A final failure to strike a deal would mean
no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes
for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered
EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical
devices, if pacts on mutual recognition of standards lapse.
Throughout the talks the EU has insisted on a strict
interpretation of its rules, aware that any concessions it makes
to Switzerland could weaken its position in the separate Brexit
negotiations.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
Earnings to the rescue. World stock markets have staged a
powerful rally over the past 24 hours, offsetting the gloom of
the past week as the first sweep of third-quarter U.S. earnings
eases concerns about any imminent slowdown in punchy U.S. profit
growth, still running at annual clip in excess of 25 percent.
Not only have the major banks such as JPMorgan, Citi, Bank of
America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley come in ahead of
forecasts, but Netflix stock surged more than 10 percent after
the bell on Tuesday as it reported subscriber growth well ahead
of expectations during the quarter. Leading the rest of the
so-called FANG internet stocks higher – Facebook, Amazon and
Google-parent Alphabet – the Netflix update helps soothe nerves
that the leading tech sector was about to roll over. Despite
trade war jitters, U.S. industrial production grew faster than
expected last month – countering the soundings from an
underwhelming retail sales report earlier in the week. U.S.
Treasury yields, which raced to seven-year peaks last week, have
also remained calm this week. They hovered close to 3.16 percent
again overnight despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest
broadside against the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. 
    The positive earnings and economics twist, helped by some
calming of relations between Western countries and Saudi Arabia
over how Riyadh plans to handle the disappearance of dissident
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate, saw all
three U.S. equity benchmarks jump more than 2 percent on
Tuesday. The VIX volatility gauge plunged below 20 percent to as
low as 17.5, almost half the peaks of last Thursday. MSCI’s
all-country index of world stocks rose 1.7 percent on Tuesday,
its biggest one-day gain since June 2016, and extended that move
this morning. It’s now re-captured about a quarter of the points
loss it suffered over the past month. The return to risk lifted
Asia bourses too, with Tokyo and Seoul gaining more than 1
percent but Shanghai underperforming with a more modest 0.6
percent rise as the U.S. Treasury report on currency
manipulation around the world is still awaited. The overall mood
shift has also helped emerging-market currencies regain some
lost ground against the dollar. A monthly survey of fund
managers conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed
investors viewing emerging-market currencies as being at their
most undervalued in the history of the poll. Although the dollar
was firmer first thing on Wednesday, some of the worst-hit
emerging-market currencies – such as Argentina’s peso, Turkey’s
lira, Brazil’s real, India’s rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah – all
regained some lost ground over the past day or so.
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set to help lift
European shares further from the 22-month low hit last week with
futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set of
corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML
and drug giant Roche. Overall, European third-quarter earnings
are expected to rise 13.6 percent, down from the 14 percent
growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES.

percent last year, the country's statistics service ELSTAT said
on Wednesday, releasing its second estimate of full-year 2017

    It said gross domestic product in volume terms and measured
at constant prices was 179.14 billion euros last year, from
176.92 billion euros in 2016.
    ELSTAT's estimate showed the economy performed slightly
better than a previous estimate in March which saw a 1.4 percent
expansion rate.
    But It was a touch weaker than the EU Commission's and the
Greek central bank's 1.6 percent projection.

economic growth picked up to 2.1 percent this year and will
accelerate further reaching 2.5 percent next year. [nL8N1WE359]

    MACRONOMICS: THE CLOCK IS TICKING...(1005 GMT) 
    With Brexit, Merkel's coalition under threat and budget angst in Italy and Spain, French
politics are not exactly at the centre of attention.
    The reshuffling of Macron's government (read all about it here: [nL8N1WW1SA]) isn't exactly
front page news outside of France but investors who have made a bet on the ability of the
40-years-old president to turn around the French economy might be a tad concerned. 
    ""We still believe the Macron team will be able to push through some additional reform, but
clearly less than markets hoped for at the start of his mandate"", ING economists write, warning
that ""the clock is ticking"" to get the job done. 
    ""The economic outlook is likely to be less supportive for reforms in the second half of
2019"", they argue with a forecast of GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2018, 1.7 percent in 2019 and
a deceleration in 2020.
    ""This leaves the new team less than one year to gain ground on major reforms"", ING believes.
    On the bright side, investors who put their money in the French economy can't complain so
far. Paris' CAC 40 has outperformed peers since Macron won the first round of the presidential
election in April 2017. (It's the orange line below)

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: TECH SHINES AS EUROPEAN STOCKS CLIMB, FRESENIUS MEDI SINKS (0715 GMT)
    European stocks are definitely feeling that boost from Wall St this morning, with benchmarks
up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across the board. Tech is driving the gains, the best-performing sector
<.SX8P> with a 2.5-percent gain after chipmaker ASML reported strong results. 
    ASML is jumping 6.6 percent, the top STOXX gainer, and driving peers AMS, STMicro, and
Infineon up with it. 
    Fresenius Medical Care is the standout faller, down 13 percent with its parent group
Fresenius also down 8.9 percent after the medical group cut its 2018 sales and income outlook
due to underperformance of its U.S. business in Q3. 
    British publishing group Pearson, a widely shorted stock with many ""sell"" ratings, is rising
4.5 percent after it reiterated its outlook for 2018, saying it was on track to return to profit
growth. [nL8N1WX14L]
    Most pre-market indications had it down 1 to 2 percent or up just 1 percent - with just one
trading desk calling the shares up 5 to 7 percent - so this strong move is likely to have
flummoxed a few. Of course the stock has a big short base, so any positive news makes big waves.

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German Justice Minister Katarina
Barley will be the Social Democrats' (SPD) top candidate in
European elections next year, the party said on Wednesday,
announcing a move that heralds a change to Chancellor Angela
Merkel's divided cabinet.
    Barley is expected to give up her current position in
conservative Merkel's ruling coalition to lead the SPD's
campaign in Germany for the election due in May.
    With conservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer under
pressure to resign following his party's disastrous performance
in a regional election in Bavaria on Sunday, Merkel may yet need
to reshuffle her cabinet in the coming weeks. [nL8N1WW56N]
    Divisions within her cabinet widened in the run-up to the
Bavaria election. 
    Since the vote, the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister
party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CSU), has vowed to
make the coalition work. CSU leader Seehofer had been Merkel's
leading critic in the ruling alliance before the election
    Barley said she wanted to help the SPD, junior partner in
Merkel's ruling alliance, after the party suffered a battering
in the Bavaria election, at which it won less than 10 percent of
the vote. ""I want to make my contribution to things improving,""
she told reporters.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles added of Barley: ""She is a born
European, with British father, a German mother, dual
nationality, her two sons have grand parents from four European
countries. She speaks four European languages fluently.""

bond yields rose on Wednesday after the country's Treasury said
it will reopen some long-dated bond issues as part of a bond
exchange deal later this week.

via a syndicate, five nominal bonds with maturities varying from
2025 to 2046 in exchange for its April 2020 BTP Italia retail

an earlier fall, and was last up 2 basis points on the day.

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone countries must each
ensure their budgets are stable and economies competitive,
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ahead of a European Union
summit on Wednesday, as Italy weighs expansionary budget plans
that risk EU rejection.
    Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, has prepared
an expansionary 2019 budget that sets up a showdown with
authorities in Brussels over compliance with EU rules. The
European Commission may reject the plans. [nL8N1WV1L6]
[nR1N1RB02K] [nR1N1VZ02C]
    Merkel told the Bundestag lower house of parliament in
Berlin that all members of the euro zone were responsible for 
their own economic and budget policy.
    ""Each state in the euro zone is obliged to take care of
stability and to take necessary reforms for its competitiveness
- and that applies now in good economic times,"" she added.
    ""At the same time, as we have learned from painful
experience, in a currency union we are so closely intertwined
with one another that national policies can always have effects
on the other member states.""
    She said stable budgets were an important condition for good
economic development in each individual country, adding: ""Solid
public finances are also a condition for trust in the currency
union."" 
    ""Our guide remains the Stability and Growth Pact. I will
continue to make the case that in Europe this principle applies:
responsibility and solidarity, liability and control - those are
two sides of the same coin,"" she added to laud applause.

    Labour unions said they would continue to protest against
the plan however, and at least 10,000 employees in the welfare
and public sector are expected to go on a two-day strike next
Monday.
    While the government has argued the reform is necessary to
curb Finland's rate of unemployment, currently at 6.8 percent,
the unions have been particularly angered by a measure that
would make it easier for small companies to dismiss workers.

submitted for approval on Wednesday a free trade agreement with
Vietnam, its first comprehensive open markets deals with a
developing Asian country.
    The EU-Vietnam trade and investment agreements will need
approval from the EU's 28 members and from the European
Parliament, some of whose members have expressed concern over
Vietnam's human rights record.
    The parties have agreed a related accord to promote
democracy and human rights, including commitments, dialogue and
possible sanctions. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said
no one denied there were human rights problems in Vietnam.
    ""We are talking openly about this with our Vietnamese
counterparts and the trade agreement will not make Vietnam a
fully fledged democracy overnight. It is one tool in the toolbox
that we have in relations with Vietnam and other countries,"" she
told a news conference.
    The European Union will sign a trade deal on Friday with
Singapore, another member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), and is in talks with Indonesia.
    It is unclear whether the European Parliament, which is
expected to debate and vote on the Singapore agreement as well
as the EU-Japan free trade deal, will have time to pass the
Vietnam accord before EU elections in May.   
    The trade deal would eliminate 99 percent of all tariffs,
although some staged over a time period and some, notably
agricultural products, limited by quotas.
    Vietnam, for example, would cut its duty on EU car imports
from 78 percent to zero over 10 years and for wines and spirits,
from around 50 percent, over seven years. EU companies would
also be able to bid for Vietnamese public contracts.
    In return, the European Union would take seven years to
eliminate its duties on certain Vietnamese products, such as its
major textiles, clothing and footwear exports.
    Vietnam has pledged to protect 169 European food and drinks
products, such as champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese,
meaning such names could only be used for EU imports.
    The agreement includes a chapter on sustainable development,
such as implementing international standards on labour rights
and the Paris climate accord.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Slovenia should press ahead
with privatisations to improve its competitiveness and reform
its pension system over the medium-term, a senior official at
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said
on Tuesday.
    ""Privatisation is really important for overall productivity
in the economy and raising the level of competitiveness,""
Charlotte Ruhe, EBRD Managing Director for Central and South
Eastern Europe, said in an interview during a visit to
Ljubljana.
    She welcomed the fact that the new centre-left government,
which took power in September, has already started privatising
state-owned banks Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Abanka, adding she
expected further sell-offs in the coming years.
    Ruhe, after holding meetings with government officials, said
the government was likely to sell some tourism firms and could
start privatisation of the largest telecoms operator, Telekom
Slovenia <TLSG.LJ>, in the second half of 2019. 
    Slovenia's privatisation coordinator Slovenian Sovereign
Holding (SDH) said on Wednesday the decision on whether Telekom
would be sold had not been made yet.
    ""At present, SDH is not leading activities connected to the
sale of Telekom Slovenia as a decision on the possible start of
the sales process has not been made yet,"" it said in a statement
prepared for Reuters.
    ""SDH ... is preparing an annual plan of managing state
assets for 2019 which will have to be approved by the
government,"" it added, saying the plan would also include the
management plan for Telekom Slovenia among other firms.
    Ruhe also said the government would have to reform the
pension system to ease the burden of a rapidly ageing population
on the state budget, giving no further details.
    Earlier on Tuesday the government's macroeconomic institute
UMAR said Slovenia should increase productivity in order to be
able to meet public sector unions' demands for higher wages.

    * Little sign of Brexit breakthrough
    * EU leaders to step up 'no deal' plans
    * Irish border remains main obstacle

    By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will address European Union counterparts in Brussels on
Wednesday but there is little hope on either side of a quick
breakthrough after Brexit talks stalled at the weekend.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed a hardening tone
among the 27 other governments, whose leaders will gather over
dinner after a presentation by May to discuss stepping up
preparations for Britain dropping out of the EU with no deal in
March.
    All member states, she said before flying to the summit,
must prepare for all outcomes: ""That includes the possibility
that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.""
    With wrangling over how to keep Northern Ireland's land
border with the EU open after Britain leaves the EU's customs
and regulatory space, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said
it was unlikely the 27 leaders would set a date for a special
summit to seal a deal - as was the hope before talks stalled.
    Summit chair Donald Tusk called on May to come to Brussels
with ""creative"" new ideas to unblock the process, but British
officials have given little indication she has much new to say
as she battles deep opposition among her own allies to the kind
of agreement which Brussels says is pretty much its final offer.
    May told parliament in London she wanted any treaty that
includes the Irish border issue linked to a separate declaration
the two sides intend to issue on their intentions for a close
EU-UK trade pact to be negotiated after Brexit.
    EU negotiators agree that a close customs and regulatory

    TRANSITION EXTENSION
    EU diplomats told Reuters on Monday that EU negotiator
Michel Barnier offered to help defuse the issue by extending a
status-quo transition period for Britain by an extra year to the
end of 2021 to give time for a trade deal that would avert the
need to trigger a backstop for Northern Ireland. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, whose chamber
needs to see a treaty this year to have time to ratify it by
March, told reporters that he would support Barnier's proposal
to lengthen the transition period to three years from two.
    Many continental officials involved in the process have long
said a longer transition may be needed to conclude a free trade
deal anyway. However, May is also under pressure from Brexit
supporters to cut ties to the bloc as soon as possible.
    May is due to address her peers at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT). There
is unlikely to be much dialogue around the table, with EU
leaders insisting London negotiate exclusively through Barnier.
    The 27 will move to a dinner without May to hear reports
from Barnier and from European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker. He will brief them on how the EU executive is stepping
up planning and guidance for governments on what must be done to
cope with Britain leaving on March 29 with no treaty in place.
    Both sides are coming under pressure from business to reach
agreement soon to avoid firms running up needless costs.
    A joint pre-summit plea from the European auto and car parts
sector warned disruption to cross-Channel supply chains would be
""catastrophic"" and wipe out much of a quarter-century of
recovery in England's car industry. [nL8N1WX1VJ]
    May will rejoin her counterparts for a regular EU summit on
Thursday, to be followed in the evening and on Friday by a
summit with Asian leaders, including China's Premier Li Keqiang
and the prime ministers of Japan, South Korea and Russia.

 (Adds May, other comments)
    By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May said she believed a Brexit deal was still possible as she
arrived in Brussels on Wednesday to meet her European Union
counterparts, three days after talks stalled over how to manage
the Irish border.
    But fellow EU leaders sounded impatient, signalling that
they were ready to listen to May but also preparing to discuss 
plans for Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a
deal.
    In pointed remarks, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite
told reporters that the essence of the problem lay in May's
inability to rally her feuding party around a workable set of
negotiating demands. There was still time for a deal, she said,
but there would be no breakthrough yet.
    May did not answer a question about whether she had brought
the ""creative"" new proposal that summit chair Donald Tusk has
asked for, instead sticking to a rehearsed line that a deal
could be done and that it was in the EU's interest to reach one.
    ""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in
the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the
Northern Irish backstop,"" she told reporters on arrival.
    ""By working intensively and closely, we can achieve that
deal,"" May added. ""Now is the time to make it happen.""
    Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed the tougher
tone coming from the 27 other governments, whose leaders will
gather over dinner after a presentation by May at 7 p.m. (1700
GMT).
    All member states, she said before flying to the summit,
must prepare for all outcomes: ""That includes the possibility
that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.""
    With wrangling over how to keep Northern Ireland's land
border with the EU open after Britain leaves the EU's customs
and regulatory space, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said
it was unlikely the 27 leaders would set a date for a special
summit to seal a deal - as was the hope before talks stalled.
    Tusk had called on May to come to Brussels with new ideas to
unblock the process, but British officials have given little
indication that she has much new to say as she battles deep
opposition among her own allies to the kind of agreement which
Brussels says is pretty much its final offer.
    May earlier told parliament in London she wanted any treaty
that includes the Irish border issue linked to a separate
declaration the two sides intend to issue on their intentions
for a close EU-UK trade pact to be negotiated after Brexit.
    EU negotiators agree that a close customs and regulatory
relationship could avert the kind of border disruption that risk
reviving sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, but they still
want a ""backstop"" guarantee that if that is not in place, then
the EU would keep the province in a special economic zone.
    May and her Northern Irish allies reject that as posing a
risk of breaking up the United Kingdom. [nL8N1WV44K]

thinner"", companies scaled back their business expectations to
11 points from 17 points in spring. Business morale regarding
current conditions remained stable at 45 points.
    The DIHK's survey of around 27,000 managers, the biggest of
its kind in Germany, found that companies viewed shortages of
skilled labour and rising labour costs as the principal risks
for their business outlook.
    Exporters also pointed to growing risks from abroad.
    ""Given the rapid pace of change, for example in global trade
policies or digitalization - and the unclear outcome of Brexit,
it is becoming more difficult for companies to foresee a clear
trend in their business development,"" DIHK said.
    The increased uncertainty is limiting companies' willingness
to invest, with DIHK expecting gross capital investments growth
to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from 3.3 percent this year.
    Imports are expected to outpace exports both this year and
next, DIHK said, in a sign that Germany's vibrant domestic
demand is likely to provide a buffer against external shocks
such as an escalation in trade tensions or a no-deal Brexit.
    German state consumption is seen rising by 1.4 percent in
2018 and 2.5 percent in 2019 while private consumption is
forecast to increase by 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent
respectively, it said.
    Companies will continue to hire more staff this year and
next, but the pace of job creation will slow from 580,000 new
positions in 2018 to 500,000 new jobs in 2019, DIHK said.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte on Thursday denied any division between the two parties in
his governing coalition, the League and the 5-Star Movement,
amid reports of a spat over tax revenues in next year's budget.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the
5-Star, said on Wednesday a legislative text on a partial tax
amnesty had been manipulated before its final approval. He did
not clarify who could have amended the document. 
    The tax amnesty is one of the revenue measures included in
Italy's draft budget for next year.
    Asked by reporters about a possible rift between the
far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star on the issue,
Conte - who is not from any political party - replied: ""There is
no division"".
    In a bid to fulfil election spending pledges, Italy's
eurosceptic government plans to boost welfare spending, cut the
retirement age and hike the country's deficit, upsetting the
European Commission.
    ""I'm aware this is not the budget the Commission expected. I
expect critical observations. We will discuss and we will reply
to these considerations,"" Conte told reporters on arriving for a
summit of European Union leaders in Brussels.
    He also described the Italian draft budget as ""beautiful"".
    The EU Commission is currently reviewing Rome's budgetary
plans and can formally raise concerns about it until next
Monday. 
    If it does so, it can then decide to send the budget back to
Rome for changes by Oct. 29, in what would be an unprecedented
move.

    * Issues such as steel, cyber attacks, WTO on the agenda

    By Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union will seek
Asian support for free trade, the Iran nuclear deal and
combating global warming at a regional summit on Thursday that
includes China, Japan and Russia as a counterbalance to a more
protectionist United States.
    Leaders from the European Union, Switzerland and Norway will
welcome 21 Asian counterparts including China's Premier Li
Keqiang after an EU summit dominated by negotiations over
Britain's departure from the world's biggest trading bloc.
    The 51 gathered leaders are set to show ""strong support"" for
the World Trade Organisation that U.S. President Donald Trump
had threatened to quit, and express ""profound alarm"" about
climate change, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters.
    Leaders representing 55 percent of global trade will
underline ""their joint commitment to open, free and
non-discriminatory trade"" and ""to fight all forms of
protectionism"", according to the draft.
    Trump says the United States is treated badly in global
trade and has blamed the WTO for allowing that to happen.
Separately, the United States and China have imposed billions of
dollars of tariffs on each other's goods while Trump has also
complained about an unfair EU trade surplus with Washington.
    ""This is a message that the European Union is more than
Brexit and that Europe has friends beyond Washington,"" said a
senior EU official involved in preparing the summit, which has
taken place every two years since 1996.
    On Friday, the EU will sign a free-trade deal with
Singapore. The bloc is also pushing for approval for another
free-trade agreement with Vietnam. [nL8N1WX4H4]
    However, the European Union is trying not to side with China
against the United States. On Tuesday, EU trade chief Cecilia
Malmstrom held talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in
Brussels on improving trade ties, although Washington accused
the bloc of moving too slowly in negotiations. [nL8N1WX60M]
    
    FROM STEEL TO CYBER ATTACKS
    The EU-Asia summit meeting will also pressure Beijing to
combat what Europe says is China's harmful overproduction of
steel and the final statement is set to say that leaders agreed
to tackle ""excess capacity in industrial sectors"", according to
the draft, which could still be modified by diplomats.
    China, which produces and consumes half the world's steel
and, has cut some 220 million tonnes of capacity since January
2016. But the European Union remains intent on pressuring China
to cut more, as well as to remove subsidies - a policy that the
West says is aimed at dominating global markets.
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to
discuss subsidies with Li at a lunch on Friday, diplomats said.
    Bolstering the Iran nuclear deal signed by global powers in
2016, and that Trump has withdrawn from, is also another
priority of the summit. 
    Leaders will call on North Korea to ""completely, verifiably
and irreversibly dismantle all its nuclear and weapons of mass
destruction"", according to the draft final statement.
    Leaders will re-commit to the Paris climate pact that Trump
pulled out of, pledging to develop more clean energy.
    Another sensitive issue is wording in the final communique
on cyber attacks and stopping computer hackers. 
    Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev will attend the
summit but it is not clear if Moscow, accused by the West of a
global hacking campaign, will agree to proposed language calling
for an end to such attacks. [nL8N1WX3LS]
    Russia denies any responsibility for cyber attacks.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Spanish bank shares fell sharply
on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruled that banks and not
clients must pay stamp duty related to mortgage loans
potentially costing lenders billions of euros in compensation. 
    ""The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,"" the court
said in a document.
    Spanish banks were severely hit after the 2008 property
crash which sent the economy in to a five-year downward spiral
and mortgages remain an important part on lenders' balance
sheets, especially those focused on the domestic market.
    After the court ruling, Bankia <BKIA.MC> fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Caixabank <CABK.MC>
fell 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.
    The decision is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders
after a European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that
banks had to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with
interest rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Bank of Spain initially said then that the lenders would
have to repay customers more than 4 billion euros ($4.6
billion)after Europe's top court overturned a previous Spanish
ruling that capped liabilities related to a disputed mortgage
clause.
    On Thursday, neither the Bank of Spain nor the Spanish
banking association AEB gave any estimates for potential costs
for Spanish lenders.
($1 = 0.8680 euros)

    WARSAW, Oct. 18 (Reuters) - Last winter, Monika Pawlik spent
her days crawling through mud and digging trenches in frozen
ground, training for Poland's home guard. Her daughter, Helena,
hadn't yet turned 2 years old.
    The town hall clerk is under no illusions about the
potential risks of serving in the volunteer army, saying she is
ready to die for the homeland. ""I understand that if there is a
war, formations such as ours are sent to their death,"" she says.
""I think that I mainly did it for myself and probably from
feeling a patriotic duty.""
    Pawlik is a citizen of the European Union, but the
24-year-old's commitment to defend her nation reflects a
mounting unease throughout Poland and elsewhere in the EU.
Nearly 15,000 Poles have joined the country's volunteer forces
since their inception in 2017, a number that Poland's military
planners hope will reach 53,000 in the coming years. 
    Poland is a fully paid-up member of NATO. As the biggest
state to join the EU from the former Soviet bloc, it has
received more EU support than any other member - over 100
billion euros ($115 billion), according to the Polish finance
ministry. EU membership is popular. But many Poles - alongside
Hungarians and Czechs in eastern Europe - are voicing discontent
over foreign influence in their internal affairs. For instance,
Poland and Hungary have defied an EU request to accept a quota
of asylum-seekers. Parties like Poland's ruling Law and Justice
(PiS) are winning support by beating a patriotic drum, and the
EU is among the targets.
    This trend has deepened fractures across the Union, which
commentators widely believe are rooted in financial crisis and
the subsequent arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants from
Syria and Africa. In Poland and other European countries that
broke free from Soviet domination in 1989, however, the
misgivings have long run far deeper.
    Pawlik lives in a village of only several dozen people about
150 km (90 miles) from the eastern border with Russia's ally
Belarus. Her small house, inherited from her grandmother, is
adorned with pots of white and red flowers in the windows. She
planted them with her husband as a tribute to Poland's
white-and-red flag, to honour the centenary of Polish
independence this year.
    ""I remember my grandmother telling me how the Germans used
to pass through these forests and then the Russians,"" said
Pawlik. ""She would tell me how a Russian would sometimes just go
over and shoot your head off and a German would shrug, pretend
not to see you and walk away.""
    Many Poles recall bitter experiences in World War Two when
Western allies failed to save the country from a Nazi German
invasion and, later, allowed it to fester under Soviet
domination. The PiS party, which won 37.6 percent of the vote
and secured a parliamentary majority in 2015, is appealing
mainly to rural, less educated and poorer voters who feel that
while Europe's liberal ways may have made some people richer,
they have not made anyone safer.
    Poland's government has allied with Hungary, whose prime
minister, Viktor Orban, has courted confrontation with Brussels
as part of what he calls a ""national liberation struggle""
against globalisation and the liberal ideas of the EU. PiS
leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski has said Poland is following Orban's
example. Both states have railed against internationalist
left-wingers and courted nationalist leaders such as Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump.
    ""We renounce this sack of stones we have been carrying on
our backs as a nation since 1989,"" Kaczynski told crowds
celebrating Polish Independence Day last Nov. 11. ""A sack of
corruption, abuse, theft, dishonesty, immorality and destruction
of Polish patriotism, Poland's sense of community.""
    Many of Poland's EU allies are angry that its government is
playing a leading role in fuelling a rift between ex-Communist
and Western members of the bloc, at a time when the EU is
grappling with Britain's decision to leave. They have accused
Warsaw of a tilt towards authoritarianism, as the state
increases its control of the judiciary, public media and parts
of the economy.
    In Brussels, senior EU officials say parties like PiS create
a false distinction between patriotism and a sense of European
community. ""Patriotism is a virtue,"" European Commission
President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a speech in September.
""Unchecked nationalism is riddled with both poison and deceit.""
    Finding itself increasingly isolated within the bloc, the
PiS government has also been more combative with Berlin, once a
leading champion of Poland's EU membership aspirations. Warsaw
says Germany still owes it billions of euros in World War Two
reparations, and has told Poles that Berlin should pay the money
back.
    A German government spokeswoman said: ""The federal
government currently has no official request from Poland in
relation to reparations claims on which it could comment.""
    
    INSECURITY
    Pawlik says she has no political views, but she is part of
the core electorate for the PiS government. Its bedrock of
support is rural communities, especially in the country's east.
    Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, a large part of the cash
it received has been devoted to big projects like roads and
bridges. But under PiS, individual incomes in rural areas have
also been helped by government programmes to give new child
benefits and increase the minimum wage.
    For Pawlik and others, Brussels has disappointed at a more
basic level. Since Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine in
2014, many people in Poland say they have been nervous of
Russian aggression. Before Russia annexed Crimea four years ago,
just 15 percent of Poles worried that their country's
independence may be under threat. That jumped after Russia
intervened in Ukraine, and the number runs at 40 percent now.
    There has recently been a massive build-up of Russian
conventional forces on the borders of the Baltic states. But the
EU has very limited joint defence capabilities. 
    This is why people like Pawlik joined the Territorial
Defence Forces (WOT) - a formation that requires recruits to
spend four months over three years in training. The force,
modelled on America's National Guard, is an integral part of
Poland's defence and deterrence potential alongside land, air,
navy and special operations, the defence ministry says. Poland's
military budget for 2018 envisages spending $153 million on the
territorial defence forces, similar to the amount earmarked for
the navy.
    Poland's government has been spending around 2 percent of
GDP on defence, as recommended by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, and is planning to gradually raise this amount to
2.5 percent of GDP.
    ""Military treaties are important but they can give an often
illusory sense of power. We need to be ready to defend ourselves
... until our allies arrive with help,"" Tadeusz Cymanski, a
senior PiS lawmaker, said in an interview. ""If we want to
preserve our independence, the current generation ought to have
a sense of national pride, a sense of community and a
willingness to sacrifice.""
    A volunteer army is an important symbol. Poland has for
centuries been invaded or carved up by its neighbours - Austria,
Germany and Russia until 1918, and later, Nazi Germany and the
Soviet Union. In World War Two, hundreds of thousands of Poles
joined an underground Home Army to defend the country after its
government was forced into exile.
    A poll by the state-controlled polling agency CBOS showed in
August that 88 percent of the population today believes being
patriotic means being willing to fight and die for the country.
    
   ""TOWARDS MATURITY""
    Being in the EU has disappointed Poles in other ways. After
Poland joined, labour markets opened up abroad. Poles left in
droves to seek work, dividing families and draining local
labour.
    More than 2 million, out of a population of over 38 million
Poles, recently moved to live abroad, drawn out of important
services such as healthcare to countries including Britain and
Germany. The population of Pawlik's county, Ostrow Mazowiecka,
has fallen by almost three percent since 2004 and she worries
there may not be enough people to help defend those who stayed
behind.
    ""I hope Helena never moves abroad,"" said Pawlik, playing
with her daughter in her garden. ""I hope she has a better sense
of what her ancestors have done for her. And I think her
children will not have to leave for abroad. I am not a supporter
of finding work away from home.""
    While EU membership has allowed large numbers of Poles to
seek work abroad under free movement rules, the EU says the
long-term thrust of its policy is to help narrow the gaps
between living standards across the continent.
    Overall, Poland's population has nudged up 0.7 percent, but
the government is trying to encourage more growth, primarily by
paying out generous child subsidies, promising pensions for
women who have at least four children but have not worked enough
to earn a pension, and offering cheaper public housing.
    The health ministry has also sponsored a booklet called
""Towards maturity"" for school instructors on family and
reproductive health, with a stated aim of ""preventing a tendency
to postpone procreation."" Included in it is a statement that
promiscuity ""changes a woman's psyche,"" because ""a woman's
nature is to devote herself entirely to a beloved man.""
    
    NOT GERMANY
    For Pawlik, there has also been a hollowness in EU
membership. She says she once did an internship in her local
town hall that was funded by the European Union. It paid better
than a regular internship, but she had to display a poster
saying who paid for her work. She felt it was like a plaque
saying, ""'This hinge has been oiled with EU funds.'""
    A European Commission official said such a poster is not an
EU requirement.
    Przemyslaw Sadura, a sociologist of education from the
Warsaw University Institute of Sociology, says national
governments such as Poland's are filling a void left by Brussels
in telling people stories that can motivate them and make sense
of life.
    ""The EU was not able to forge its own story, its own myth;
it couldn't weave together national stories into a single tale,""
he said. PiS, he said, ""has a vision. It encompasses patriotism,
a vision for the modernisation of Poland, a national engagement,
a national economy. It's about ethnic community.""
    EU Commission officials say they have no simple answers to
what they view as a global trend, of politicians who exploit
people's unease with change by appealing to nostalgia for a
national past. But such attitudes generate frustration that
Brussels officials rarely voice in public. ""Central Europe loves
a sense of victimisation,"" one senior EU official told Reuters
privately, acknowledging the difficulty institutions have in
responding to complaints from Warsaw and Budapest.
    As it builds its nostalgic story, PiS has introduced a
sweeping reform of school programmes, focusing in particular on
history, literature, civics and geography. From now, school
children will be taught about the ""benefits and costs"" of EU
membership, according to education ministry documents. The
ministry mandated the added word, ""costs.""
    The new core curriculum says that ""the aim of schooling is
to strengthen the sense of national identity, connection to
history and national traditions.""
    That includes Poland's status as a victim of Nazi Germany.
Many Poles feel the West has failed to acknowledge the depth of
the nation's suffering under the occupation, focusing instead
only on the Jewish Holocaust. The government says some Poles
have been unjustly vilified as perpetrators of atrocities
against the Jews. In fact, some sheltered Jews. And Poles
themselves were deemed ""sub-human"" by the Nazis.
    Earlier this year, Poland's government passed a law that
would allow the courts to jail anyone suggesting the Polish
nation was complicit in the Holocaust. Under pressure from the
United States, it later watered that down to remove jail terms. 
    At the same time, the education ministry has cancelled an
obligation for schools to give anti-discrimination workshops. A
school superintendent, appointed by PiS, recently urged
teenagers to follow the example of a 17th-century king who
fought against the Ottoman empire. The superintendent was quoted
in the media as saying the great king ""managed to defend the
whole of Europe against Islam.""
    In the fourth grade, when history is introduced as a
subject, children aged 9 to 10 are presented with vignettes of
around two dozen historic figures designed to promote a sense of
national pride. These characters are described by the education
ministry as having ""a momentous impact on the formation of the
Polish cultural identity.""
    They include Christian kings, a Polish-born Pope (John Paul
II) who inspired the nation to stand up to communism, Marie
Sklodowska-Curie, who won the Nobel Prize for her research on
radioactivity, and the Solidarity movement which spearheaded the
end of Communist rule in Europe.
    ""History should arouse pride,"" said Wlodzimierz Suleja, the
historian who developed the new programmes. ""Our history is
grand ... We were exceptional in Europe."" He says he is
referring to the fact Poles were able to sustain a sense of
nationhood when the country was overrun by others.
    To many in Poland, which has for centuries embraced
Catholicism as a way to distinguish its culture from Protestant
Germany and Orthodox Russia, religious values are fundamental.
One town has engraved marble tablets with the Ten Commandments
to be hung at the entrances to local schools.
    Pawlik says when she was at school, the system failed to
teach her an appreciation of her own heritage. ""Our system tends
to focus on teaching the history of Germany, its kings, Russia.
We didn't learn much about Poland,"" she said. ""We need to focus
on what happened here.""
    
    SACRIFICE
    At the heart of the PiS story is a group of fighters who
kept an underground resistance going even after the end of World
War Two, turning against the Communist authorities.
    PiS holds up the fighters, known as the Doomed or Cursed
Soldiers, as a model for youth, praising them for being
uncompromising, unyielding and willing to be martyred despite
having the odds stacked against them.
    Controversy surrounds them. Several have been accused of
killing civilian villagers, often Jews, Slovaks and Belarusians,
as they sought to resist Soviet authorities setting up a
Communist state in Poland.
    But they are the example for Pawlik and other fighters in
the territorial defence forces. In a ceremony in 2016, President
Andrzej Duda called them ""the last of the great heroes"" who
sacrificed their lives for the country. 
    One of the Doomed Soldiers is a woman known by her nom de
guerre, Inka. A 17-year-old medic and member of the Home Army in
World War Two, she was sentenced to death by the Communist
authorities and refused to sign a plea for clemency. Before her
death, she wrote a note to relatives, saying, ""I am sad that I
have to die. Please tell my grandmother that I behaved as one
should.""
    When Pawlik was doing her training, she says, she learned
how to fire weapons and was surprised to find she was no weaker
than the men. She wants to be a professional soldier.
    ""If I go for something, I take it to the end,"" she said.
""But I'm not doing it all for myself. I'm also doing this for
the baby.""

    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Some members of the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria who are under
surveillance for alleged links to extremist groups won seats in
its parliamentary election at the weekend, the state's
intelligence agency said.
    An agency spokesman said on Thursday that the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency was checking whether it has a
constitutional mandate to continue monitoring those individuals,
who are now lawmakers in the state assembly.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition is divided over
whether the federal intelligence agency should monitor the AfD,
which entered the national parliament for the first time in an
election last year after campaigning on an anti-Islam platform.
    In Bavaria, the party - which says Islam is incompatible
with the German constitution - secured 22 seats in the regional
parliament based on a little over 10 percent of the vote. It
drew some traditional voters from Merkel's conservative allies
in the state, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
    ""Among the people under surveillance by the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency are individuals who won a mandate
for the AfD in the election on Oct. 14,"" the Bavarian
intelligence service spokesman wrote in an email.
    He declined to say how many of the 22 AfD lawmakers are
under surveillance. The AfD's leader in Bavaria did not respond
to an email seeking comment. The story was first reported by the
Muenchner Merkur newspaper. 
    The intelligence agency spokesman said a low double-digit
number of AfD members were being monitored for suspected links
to anti-Islamic and ""right-wing extremist"" groups as well as to
the anti-government Reichsbuerger movement, which claims that
the modern-day Federal Republic of Germany is illegitimate.
    
    CHEMNITZ CLASHES
    Pressure grew on Merkel's government to order federal agents
to start monitoring the AfD after its supporters held protests
in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month to denounce the fatal
stabbing of a German man, allegedly by two migrants.
    Skinheads clashed with police soon after a Syrian and an
Iraqi were identified as suspects, and a mob attacked a Jewish
restaurant, exposing bitter divisions over Merkel's 2015
decision to welcome some one million, mainly Muslim migrants.
    Soon after the protests in Chemnitz, the states of Lower
Saxony and Bremen said their security services had placed the
AfD's youth wings under surveillance for suspected
unconstitutional activities.
    But Merkel rejected calls to put the AfD, now Germany's
largest opposition party, under surveillance, saying it was the
job of intelligence officials, not politicians, to make such
decisions based on facts.
    However, leaders of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD),
junior coalition partners of Merkel's conservatives, said the
clashes in Chemnitz gave clear cause for a renewed look at
whether the AfD should be monitored.
    Memories of Nazi and Communist oppression between 1933 and
1989 have made Germans very cautious about state surveillance,
but a poll published last month found that 57 percent agreed
that the AfD should be monitored.

    VATICAN CITY, Oct 18 (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon
Jae-in met Pope Francis on Thursday and the president's office

    Moon, who is Catholic, relayed the invitation verbally,

    Moon's top press secretary, Yoon Young-chan, quoted the pope
as saying he would ""unconditionally give an answer if an

Yonhap.
    The president asked the pope if he may tell the North Korean
leader to send an official delegate to invite the pope. The pope
said the verbal invitation relayed by President Moon should be
sufficient but that an official invitation would also be good,
according to Yoon.
    According to a Vatican pool reporter, Moon told the pope
during a picture taking session: ""You are not only the leader of
the Roman Catholic Church but a maestro of humanity.""
    The Vatican was later issuing its own statement on the
meeting, which lasted 35 minutes.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - EU authorities will raise their
concerns with Italy on Thursday over fiscal rule breaches in its
2019 budget, an official said, sending a formal warning letter
that could lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end
of the month.
    Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici will hand the
consultation letter to Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria in
Rome. 
    The EU official told Reuters the Commission was expecting a
reply from Italy, and possible changes to the draft budget,
before taking any further action.
    Italy is pressing ahead with an expansionary budget that
will boost its deficit and risks further increasing its huge
public debt pile.
    Other euro zone countries will also receive consultation
letters on their draft budgets, the official said, but only in
the case of Italy will the Commission highlight that there is a
serious deviation from EU fiscal targets.
    ""Italy's is a case apart,"" the official said. Under EU
rules, the letter to Rome could precede a Commission rejection
of the Italian budget by Oct. 29.
    With other countries, which the official declined to name,
the Commission will raise doubts about possible fiscal risks.
But only Rome will receive a letter on Thursday, while other
countries will be informed from Friday.

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Some members of the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria who are under
surveillance for alleged links to extremist groups won seats in
its parliamentary election at the weekend, the state's
intelligence agency said.
    An agency spokesman said on Thursday that the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency was checking whether it has a
constitutional mandate to continue monitoring those individuals,
who are now lawmakers in the state assembly.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition is divided over
whether the federal intelligence agency should monitor the AfD,
which entered the national parliament for the first time in an
election last year after campaigning on an anti-Islam platform.
    In Bavaria the party secured 22 seats in the regional
parliament based on a little over 10 percent of the vote. It
drew voters from Merkel's conservative allies in the state, the
Christian Social Union (CSU).
    ""Among the people under surveillance by the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency are individuals who won a mandate
for the AfD in the election on Oct. 14,"" the Bavarian
intelligence service spokesman wrote in an email.
    Martin Sichert, the AfD's leader in Bavaria, told Reuters:
""This gives people the possibility to see, through the public
service of our lawmakers in the regional assembly, that there is
no justification for monitoring the AfD."" 
    The spy agency spokesman declined to say how many of the 22
AfD lawmakers were under surveillance. He said a low
double-digit number of AFD party members were being monitored
for possible ties to anti-Islamic and ""right-wing extremist""
groups.
    Pressure grew on Merkel's government to order federal agents
to start monitoring the AfD after its supporters held protests
in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month to denounce the fatal
stabbing of a German man, allegedly by two migrants.
    Skinheads clashed with police soon after a Syrian and an
Iraqi were identified as suspects, and a mob attacked a Jewish
restaurant, exposing bitter divisions over Merkel's 2015
decision to welcome some one million, mainly Muslim migrants.
    Soon after the protests in Chemnitz, the states of Lower
Saxony and Bremen said their security services had placed the
AfD's youth wings under surveillance for suspected
unconstitutional activities.
    Memories of Nazi and Communist oppression have made Germans
very cautious about state surveillance, but a poll published
last month found that 57 percent agreed that the AfD should be
monitored.

    * ""This is the deal - if ever there's to be one"" - diplomat
    * Only limited ways to salvage an agreement 

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain
have given themselves a few more weeks to break the deadlock in
their Brexit talks but for Brussels the delay seems mainly about
Prime Minister Theresa May dealing with critics back in London.
    An accord sketched by officials from both sides last weekend
stalled because May's fractious government rejected a ""backstop""
insurance clause the EU wants in case future talks fail to forge
a trade pact that avoids customs posts on the Irish border.
    An EU offer to extend a status-quo transition period by a
year to end-2021, keeping Britain in a customs union to diminish
the chances of the backstop being triggered, was not enough.
    EU negotiator Michel Barnier pledged at a summit to keep
working ""calmly and patiently"". But many EU leaders see the main
negotiations to be had now as being among May and her allies in
London, possibly only after she gets a budget through parliament
early next month. They see little scope now for the EU to move.
    ""We took our steps. We need to know what the other side
wants - finally,"" said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite.
    Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, less than
three years since Britons voted for an exit in a referendum. 
    ""This is pretty much it,"" an EU diplomat said of the weekend
offer, which included a longer transition to give time for a
customs deal. ""This is the deal - if ever there's to be one."" 
    French President Emmanuel Macron noted the tricky ""political
balance"" May faces at home -- her vital Northern Irish allies
say the EU's backstop, by keeping Northern Ireland alone in the
EU customs area, would break up the United Kingdom; and Brexit
hardliners insist the UK must leave the EU customs union soon.
    
    ACID TEST
    All governments insist, though, that they want a deal in the
coming weeks that can avoid chaos when Britain leaves in March.
    There are limited ways to salvage an agreement.
    The EU is firmly behind Ireland. It says any ""hard border""
infrastructure on its frontier with the British province of the
island would revive sectarian conflict. Many small EU states see
the willingness of big powers to risk trade with Britain to
protect Ireland as an acid test of the value of EU membership.
    That limits May's scope for rejecting any backstop at all. 
    Her solution so far has been to offer to keep the British
mainland also inside EU customs rules for a time. But the EU has
rejected that because it says it appears to offer Britain too
many trading advantages without deeper negotiations which it is
only willing to start after Britain has left the Union.
    Yet if a deal is to be struck, the focus will be finding a
formulation that makes a customs border between Northern Ireland
and the British mainland highly improbable and/or makes a UK-EU
future customs zone more certain than Brussels now wants. And
more permanent than May's hardline Brexit supports would accept.
    ""There are many ways to skin a cat,"" another EU diplomat
working on the Brexit conundrum said. ""But only so many -- and
we have looked at all of them. So it's either the backstop or
all of the United Kingdom staying inside our customs zone.""
    ""Now, Britain must simply pick.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte presented his country's 2019 draft budget to EU leaders in
Brussels on Thursday, but the summit did not discuss it in any
detail, the head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker
said.
     ""The Italian Prime Minister presented the Italian situation
to us, with big talent and in a very clear way, and we did not
ask him about it because (the Commission) is currently examining
the draft budget as sent to us by the Italian authorities,""
Juncker told a news conference.
    ""We have no negative prejudice against the Italian budget,""
Juncker said.
    Italy's populist government wants to finance higher spending
and lower taxes with more borrowing and presented a draft 2019
budget to the European Commission on Monday with a deficit three
times as high as the one the EU agreed with the previous
government in Rome.
    Italy has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe and
the highest debt servicing costs and because its economy grows
slowly, officials are concerned that more debt could trigger
another debt crisis like the one set off by Greece in 2010 that
nearly destroyed the euro zone.
    ""We did not discuss the Italian draft budget in detail, that
was not the meeting to doing so, but I know from the past that
the Commission has always been accused of being too generous
when it came to Italian budgets,"" Juncker said.
    He noted that Italy has been the only euro zone country to
have used every possibility to spend more money under EU rules,
called the Stability and Growth Pact, which allowed it to spend
30 billion euros more in the last three years without sanctions.
    ""I had some colleagues (EU leaders) on the phone, they don't
want us to add flexibility to already existing flexibility and
that is not our intention,"" Juncker said.
    ""We were very kind, gentle and positive when it came to
Italy. Because Italy is Italy,"" he said, in a reference to a
similar remark he made about France when justifying the
Commission's green light for extra spending by Paris in the
past.

the rules is essential as the openness for changes to deepen
integration,"" the official reported Draghi as saying.

stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff edge
if Britain leaves the bloc with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be published in the coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks have called for regulators to take preventive action
to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives contracts if
there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern that has emerged, but the
private sector could take action to mitigate risks, such as
shifting contracts from London to the EU before March.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Dombrovskis said he would be following up on the central
banks' initial findings to see if any regulatory action was
needed by the EU.
    ""There is no cliff edge,"" Olivier Guersent, Dombrovskis' top
civil servant added.

    ELECTIONS
    On Sunday Poland conducts local elections: Poles will vote
for city mayors, as well as city councils, among others. The
official results will be known no earlier than on Monday.
    
    PARTY POLLS
    Ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party is supported
by 34 percent of Poles, while its arch-rival centrist Civic
Platform (PO) acting in a coalition with liberal Nowoczesna
party by 24 percent, a poll quoted by Super Express tabloid
ahead of Sunday local elections showed.
    This means that PiS may not be able to take over local
governments and cement its power over the country, as it would
need to build coalitions with smaller parties not always willing
to cooperate with a party accused of breaching democracy norms.
    A poll published this week by state-funded pollster CBOS
showed that support for PiS in local elections fell within a
month by 5 percentage points to 29 percent, but the party still
led in the poll.
    Another poll presented by Gazeta Wyborcza daily regarding
support in a future parliamentary elections showed that support
for a coalition of parties led by PiS fell by 11 percentage
points within a month.

    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini said there was no government crisis after a row
broke out in the ruling coalition over a tax amnesty draft bill,
Il Messaggero said on Friday citing Salvini.
    But Salvini, who is also leader of the right-wing League
party, said the decree containing the proposal had to stay as it
was if they did not want to create a dangerous precedent.
    On Friday, the head of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement, Luigi Di Maio, said a dispute with coalition partner
the League over a tax amnesty needed to be sorted. [nL8N1WY6Z6]
    Di Maio, also deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday the
text of the amnesty had been ""manipulated"" after his party had
signed off on the measure in cabinet, raising doubts about the
stability of the coalition government.
    The populist 5-Star and League coalition took office at the
beginning of June.
    ""We will press ahead. And there is absolutely no government
crisis,"" Salvini was quoted by Il Messaggero as saying.
    Salvini said changing the text would send the message that
everything could be changed and that ""everything is a joke"".
    But he described the run-in with Di Maio as just ""a big
misunderstanding"".
    While 5 Star has always opposed amnesties, the right-wing
League, with its traditional voter-base of self-employed
businessmen, is more favourable.
    Giancarlo Giorgetti, a cabinet undersecretary and
high-ranking League official, told La Repubblica that 5 Star had
not told them or Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of their concerns

 (Adds ECB rate hike expectations, quotes, background, updates

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
hit four-year highs on Friday, extending their rise after the
European Union slammed Rome's draft budget, while money markets
were betting that the EU-Italy tug-of-war could force the ECB to
delay its first rate rise.
    German government bonds, seen as a safe asset in the euro
zone, rallied. But Portuguese and Spanish bonds, resilient so
far through the Italian budget debacle, also sold off, with some
analysts suggesting this was the first sign of contagion from
Italy. 
    Italy's Prime Minister defended the free-spending budget on
Thursday, brushing off criticism from Brussels as the European
Commission stepped up pressure over a draft it labelled an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules. [nL8N1WY213]    
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the
month. [nL8N1WY4UV]    
    While it is not unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of the budget, the sending of the
formal letter and the tone of the comments were particularly
strong, analysts said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid told clients. 
    ""The next week will likely see things escalate further given
these tensions, an ECB meeting where little sympathy is likely
to be given, and also the upcoming rating agency actions,"" he
added.  
    S&P Global is due to review Italy's rating next Friday,
October 26, while Moody's said it would likely complete a review
of Italy's rating at the end of October.
    A downgrade would put Italy a notch away from junk status
and the potential loss of hundreds of billions of fund flows
that go with an investment grade rating.     
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent,
the highest since February 2014. <IT10YT=RR>     
    The 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at 332 basis
points, just below a 5-1/2 year high hit on Thursday.
<DE10IT10=RR> [nL8N1WY5V7]  
    Italy's 30-year bond yield hit a 4-1/2 year high of 4.22 pct
before dropping to 4.09 percent, still up two bps on the day and
adding to a 20 bps increase over Wednesday and Thursday.
<IT30YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, euro zone money markets are starting to push back
the timing of a European Central Bank's first interest rate rise
to  October 2019.
    Having fully priced a September 2019 hike as recently as
Monday, money markets now suggest just a 75 percent chance of a
10 bps ECB rate hike in September 2019 and fully price a hike in
October <ECBWATCH>, a bet that a tussle between Italy and EU may
force the ECB to be more cautious in removing stimulus. 
    The budget wrangling has put a lid on the euro's recent
revival. The single currency on Friday fell towards a two-month
low of $1.14325 <EUR=EBS> and has weakened over one percent this
week.
    The Italian selloff drove investors into German government
bonds with yields briefly touching 0.407 percent, the lowest in
over a month. German yields are now around 16 bps below this
month's peak. <DE10YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year government bond
yields rose 3-4 basis points each to hit a fresh one-year high
of 1.77 percent and a five-month high of 2.08 percent
respectively. <ES10YT=RR>, <PT10YT=RR> 
    Commerzbank strategists flagged the rise in Spanish yields
as a sign of contagion from Italy, calling it ""textbook crisis
dynamics"" in a note.

for a ""backstop"" to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland.
    He also told reporters on the third day of EU summit
meetings in Brussels that it would be up to British Prime
Minister Theresa May to decide whether she had to defy
opposition from her unionist Northern Irish allies and agree to
the EU's proposed backstop, which would potentially create trade
barriers between Northern Ireland and the British mainland.
    He said it was a ""judgment call"" May would have to make but
said that without an Irish backstop, any withdrawal treaty might
not be ratified by the European Parliament.

world,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said.
    The biennial Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) brings together
leaders from the EU, Switzerland and Norway and 21 Asian
counterparts, including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
    After a dinner on Thursday, sessions on improving
connectivity and the multilateral system and a host of bilateral
meetings will conclude on Friday with EU leaders and Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong signing an agreement eight years
in the making.
    Singapore has been made to wait. Negotiations ended in 2014,
but as protests mounted against other trade accords, such as one
planned with the United States and one struck with Canada, the
deal was sent for approval to the European Court of Justice 
    The Commission hopes the agreement, which still requires
backing by the European Parliament, will take effect next year. 
    It would likely follow a larger free trade agreement the EU
plans with Japan and would be the EU's first trade agreement
with a member of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
    The EU remains interested in a deal with ASEAN, after talks 
were shelved in 2009. In the meantime, EU negotiators have
agreed a trade accord with Vietnam, are in  negotiations with
Indonesia and have held talks with three other ASEAN members. 
    
    TRADE SANCTIONS
    However, other less harmonious issues may also surface. 
    The EU told Cambodia earlier this month that it would lose
its special access to the world's largest trading bloc and said
it was considering similar sanctions for Myanmar in a toughening
of EU policy on human rights in Southeast Asia [nL8N1WL2JW].
    Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen was in Brussels, while
Myanmar sent its minister for international cooperation.
    ""Of course we will have to bring up questions of human
rights and values in bilateral talks,"" German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said.
    The summit could also see Beijing facing pressure to combat
what Europe says is Chinese overcapacity, notably in steel.
    China, which produces and consumes half the world's steel,
has cut some 220 million tonnes of capacity since January 2016.
But the EU wants China to cut more, as well as to remove
subsidies - a policy that has seen it form an alliance with
Tokyo and Washington.
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to
discuss subsidies with Li at a lunch on Friday, diplomats said.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo
Varadkar said on Friday that a possible extension of Britain's
post-Brexit transition period would not diminish Ireland's need
for a ""backstop"" to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland.
    He also told reporters on the third day of EU summit
meetings in Brussels that it would be up to British Prime
Minister Theresa May to decide whether she had to defy
opposition from her unionist Northern Irish allies and agree to
the EU's proposed backstop, which would potentially create trade
barriers between Northern Ireland and the British mainland.
    He said it was a ""judgment call"" May would have to make but
said that without an Irish backstop, any withdrawal treaty might
not be ratified by the European Parliament. He acknowledged that
May faces a difficult domestic political situation, running a
minority government with internal divisions on the Brexit issue.
    Varadkar also renewed a warning that a return of customs
posts on his country's border with Northern Ireland could see a
return to violence in the British province: 
    ""Certainly it's something that's in the back of my mind as a
potential consequence if we get this wrong.""
    On the issue of extending Britain's transition period, he
said: ""I'm open to the idea of an extension or a longer
transition period, but that's not an alternative to a legally
binding Irish backstop. So, certainly not an alternative, it's
just something that might be part of the mix.""

    By Steve Scherer
    TURIN, Italy, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime
Minister Matteo Salvini has doubled support for his far-right
party in just seven months by cultivating a savvy social media
presence that any politician would envy - including his
inspiration, Donald Trump.
    Salvini, who modelled his ""Italians first"" campaign after
Trump's successful U.S. presidential bid, has built an effective
communications machine aimed not just at bolstering his League
party's popularity at home but also helping anti-immigrant,
populist forces win control of European parliament next May.
    Salvini has been especially successful on Facebook, Italy's
most popular platform with 34 million active users per month out
of an eligible voting population of 46.6 million.
    Although Trump's page has more ""likes"" at 23.5 million
versus Salvini's 3.2 million, the Italian's followers are more
""engaged"", according to data compiled by Pietro Raffa, a digital
strategist for Milan communications consultancy MR & Associati. 
    In the first week of July, for example, 2.6 million people
liked, commented, shared or watched videos on Salvini's 82
Facebook posts, versus 1.5 million engagements on 32 posts for
Trump, Raffa's data showed.
    ""Salvini always has much more engagement than Trump,"" Luca
Morisi, Salvini's social media strategist and the man behind the
machine, said at a workshop hosted by pollster and political
analysis firm YouTrend in early October.
    Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Reuters that U.S.
politicians could learn a lot from Salvini's methods.
    ""The use of social media and Facebook Live... were state of
the art,"" said Bannon, who has met Salvini more than once. ""I
was blown away by how sophisticated he was and how he managed to
do it on a shoestring.""
    Much of the credit goes to Morisi, 45, who developed
software for financial institutions before joining Salvini. His
team of 10 works 24 hours a day if necessary, averaging 10
Facebook posts a day and spreading content across YouTube,
Twitter and Instagram, and through Whatsapp and Telegram chat
groups.
    Using a specially designed matrix of software, collectively
dubbed ""the Beast"", the team creates graphics, pumps out adverts
for upcoming events, publishes on multiple social media
platforms, and monitors news.
    A loyal and growing cohort of ""real people"" churn out social
media support for Salvini voluntarily, Morisi said in his
presentation, titled ""The Legend of the Captain"", a ubiquitous
nickname for Salvini that Morisi coined.
    ""There's a community that was built up over time, piece by
piece, brick by brick, that today is very strong,"" he told the
workshop for aspiring political communications professionals. 
    Morisi avoids the limelight and rarely speaks to the media.
A Reuters reporter was allowed to attend his closed-door talk
and take part in a question-and-answer session afterwards - the
only reporter there - but Morisi declined to be interviewed
separately. 
   
    THE BRAND
    The machine started up in earnest in January 2014, less than
a month after Salvini took the reins of a party polling around 3
percent and plagued by corruption scandals, Morisi said.
    Morisi set aside party references and made Salvini - a
folksy, 45-year-old politician with a reputation for plain
speaking - the brand.
    Now the League polls as high as 34 percent, better than its
5-Star Movement coalition partner. In September, Salvini's
Facebook page had 28 million unique views, and Morisi said it
has recently reached as high as 30 million.
    Like Trump, Salvini doesn't shy away from controversy that
sparks debate and more traffic. ""The more they call us racists,
the closer we get to 51 percent,"" he said in a Facebook video on
Sept. 25.
    ""The secret of Salvini's communication is Salvini himself,
together with a team of people who have worked with him for a
long time, which plans and amplifies the message,"" Morisi said.
    Chubby and bearded, Salvini invites people into his world,
posting pictures of the reality TV show he's watching -
""Temptation Island VIP"", for example - or, at 11:30 p.m., the
chestnuts he's roasted as a snack.  
    ""How much I like chestnuts!!!"", he wrote on Oct. 3. ""Have a
nice evening friends. You can count on me."" 
    ""These posts are very important because they create a direct
relationship with people, and they help distinguish Salvini from
the unpopular caste of politicians,"" Morisi said.
    The personal posts are mixed in with automated plugs for his
radio or TV appearances, or with news. Then there are the
Facebook Live videos, including one from the roof of parliament
- ""the only place in the building where we could find a 4G
connection,"" Morisi said - where Salvini attacked the
""eurocrats"" in Brussels.
    Together with France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen,
Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban and others,
Salvini aims to overthrow the European Union's liberal
establishment and restore power to nation states, an agenda many
see as a threat to European unity.
    When he was placed under investigation for kidnapping after
refusing to allow migrants to disembark from an Italian coast
guard ship, Salvini went live on Facebook from his interior
ministry office to open the court order.
    Where other Italian politicians might squirm with
embarrassment, Salvini acted like the investigation was a medal
of honour, with his audience as happy accomplices. 
    ""It is you who asked this minister to control the borders,
to control the ports, to limit arrivals, to limit the departure
of illegal migrants,"" he told his viewers.    
    
    SOUFFLE
    To keep people's attention on the Internet, you need graphic
variety - different type cases, emoticons and bullets in text -
consistency of narrative voice, accuracy in spelling and
grammar, brevity and speed, Morisi said.
    ""One day on social media is like a week in the pre-social
media era,"" he said. He aims to publish a post every two hours
to announce that ""the bar is open"". 
    ""If you leave a page even only a few hours without new
content, it sags like a souffle,"" he said.
    To amplify Salvini's message before the March general
election, Morisi created a contest: the fastest person to ""like""
Salvini's posts each day would get their picture on his page.
The top four clickers during the three-week game won a coffee
and a selfie with their ""captain"". Some 50,000 people signed up.
    Any spike in numbers is amplified by Facebook's algorithm,
he said.
    Morisi denied reports by La Stampa newspaper and others that
the ""Beast"" software picks up on the mood of the online audience
at any given moment to hone Salvini's message.
    ""There's no algorithm that suggests to us or to Salvini what
should be talked about,"" he said. ""An expert communicator with
years and years of experience doesn't need an algorithm that
tells him to take a picture of chestnuts.""

 (Updates with latest draft statement)
    By Philip Blenkinsop and Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union was set to
sign a trade deal with Singapore on Friday after talks with
Asian leaders keen to push back against U.S. protectionism, but
efforts to encourage China to drop state subsidies ran into
resistance from Beijing.
    The biennial Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) brings together
leaders representing 65 percent of global economic output --
from the EU, Switzerland, Norway and 21 Asian countries,
including Russia and China.
    The EU hoped to use the gathering to show the world it can
move beyond Britain's departure from the bloc.
    However, a final summit communique was set to omit a call
for an end to government trade distortions, according to the
latest draft and EU diplomats.
    China requested the changes at a negotiation of senior EU
and Asian officials overnight, two diplomats said. The statement
will instead commit to ""free and open trade on a level playing
field"" and to fighting ""all forms of protectionism"", in an
indirect reference to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports.
    The earlier draft, seen by Reuters, had called for ""the
elimination of unjustifiable market distorting measures by
governments"".
    
    SUBSIDIES
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was due to
discuss subsidies with Li at lunch, diplomats said.
    The European Union and the United States accuse China of
directly funding state companies through Chinese banks to help
them to dominate global markets, breaking rules set down by the
World Trade Organization, of which China is a member.
    The EU also wants China, which produces and consumes half
the world's steel and has cut some 220 million tonnes of
manufacturing overcapacity since January 2016, to reduce its
capacity further.
    After sessions on improving connectivity and the
multilateral system and a host of bilateral meetings, the summit
was due to finish on Friday with the EU signing an agreement
with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
    That pact has been eight years in the making. Negotiations
ended in 2014, but as protests mounted against other trade
accords, such as one planned with the United States and one
struck with Canada, the deal was sent for approval to the
European Court of Justice 
    The Commission hopes the agreement, which still needs the
backing of the European Parliament, will take effect next year. 
    
    VIETNAM, INDONESIA
    It would likely follow a larger free trade agreement that
the EU plans with Japan, and would be the EU's first trade
agreement with a member of the 10-country Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
    The EU remains interested in a deal with ASEAN, after talks
were shelved in 2009. In the meantime, EU negotiators have
agreed a trade accord with Vietnam, are in negotiations with
Indonesia and have held talks with three other ASEAN members. 
    However, other less harmonious issues may also surface. 
    The EU told Cambodia this month that it would lose its
special access to the world's largest trading bloc and said it
was considering similar sanctions for Myanmar in a toughening of
policy on human rights in Southeast Asia. [nL8N1WL2JW]
    Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen was in Brussels, while
Myanmar sent its minister for international cooperation. 
    The summit statement will call for an end to the Rohingya
crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.
    ""Of course we will have to bring up questions of human
rights and values in bilateral talks,"" German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said.

    BERLIN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf
Scholz is working with international counterparts on a global
minimum corporate tax, a ministry spokesman said on Friday, as
governments look to prevent companies from shopping around for
tax havens.
    A crackdown by the European Commission on deals between
individual EU governments and multinationals has resulted in
Apple <AAPL.O>, Starbucks <SBUX.O> and Fiat <FCHA.MI> paying
billions of euros in back taxes. 
    ""The goal is to prevent unfair tax competition,"" the
spokesman said. ""The German government is convinced that big,
digital and border-crossing companies must do their part to
finance the common good.""
    Conceptual work on the proposal is still under way and
consultations are still at an early stage, the spokesman said.
    Germany is working closely with France on the plan, German
newspaper Handelsblatt reported, adding that Scholz has asked
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD)
to consider the proposal.
    The proposal would be an extension of BEPS, a set of OECD
policies to tackle tax avoidance strategies that allow
multinational companies to shift profits artificially to low or
no-tax locations.
    Handelsblatt quoted an OECD official as saying the proposal
had been well received but that talks remained at an early
stage. ""In the context of the BEPS discussion, France and
Germany have proposed discussing a minimum tax and making it the
standard,"" OECD tax lead Pascal Saint-Amans was quoted as
saying.
    The goal is not to force countries to potentially raise
their tax levels, but to give them a way to ensure that
companies did not skip paying taxes at all.

    By Inti Landauro
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The global watchdog for
money-laundering regulation said on Friday it will set up its
first rules by June on how countries should oversee
cryptocurrencies.
    The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said
jurisdictions across the world will be required to license or
regulate exchanges and some firms providing cryptocurrency
wallets, in a bid to stamp out the use of digital money for
money laundering, terrorism financing or other crime.
    Firms providing financial services for issuances of new
cryptocurrencies - initial coin offerings - must also be subject
to the rules, it said.
    The FATF move represents a landmark moment for
cryptocurrency regulation - something that, until now, has
defied global coordination and led to a patchwork of differing
approaches by national governments. 
    Countries that fail to set up the required rules would be
added to the FATF blacklist, which restricts access to the
global financial system by jurisdictions found not do enough to
prevent financial crime, said President Marshall Billingslea.
    ""By June, we will issue additional instructions on the
standards and how we expect them to be enforced,"" he said.
    Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens whose creators say they
can be used as money without the backing of any country's
central bank. The first and most popular is bitcoin, which has
been followed by hundreds of others issued around the world.

percent in the third quarter of this year from the previous
three months as industrial output stagnated, the Bank of Italy
estimated on Friday.
    Recent data has pointed to slowing activity in the euro
zone's third largest economy, and this month the government
revised down the official estimate for 2018 growth to 1.2
percent from a 1.5 percent projection made in April.
    The faltering economy was one reason given by the ruling
coalition for presenting an expansionary 2019 budget that has
riled the European Commission, which says it will push up
Italy's mammoth public debt.
    ""The available cyclical indicators suggest that in the third
quarter, gross domestic product growth slowed to about 0.1
percent compared with the previous quarter,"" the Bank of Italy
said in its quarterly economic bulletin.
    Italy posted growth of 0.2 percent in the second quarter,
and a 0.1 percent rate in the third would be the slowest since
the second quarter of 2016.
    Italy has been under financial market pressure since the new
government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League took office in June, and a sell-off of
government bonds has accelerated in the last few days.
    The Bank of Italy said foreign investors reduced their
holdings of Italian securities by 42.8 billion euros in the
first eight months of this year, disposing of 24.9 billion euros
of government bonds and 12.4 billion euros of bank bonds.
    Despite the financial market tensions, bank lending to firms
and households is ""rising moderately, supported by a small
expansion in demand,"" the bulletin said.
    In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of new
non-performing loans to outstanding loans fell to 1.5 percent on
a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, the central bank said.
    The ratio was 1.7 percent in the first quarter.

    By Leigh Thomas
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - While France has experienced
political turbulence and disappointing economic data in recent
months, beneath the surface are signs of deeper change that
suggest President Emmanuel Macron's reform drive is starting to
bear fruit.
    For much of this year, the 40-year-old president and former
investment banker has had to endure less-than-thrilling news on
the economic front, with consumer and business confidence
wilting and the growth outlook souring.
    But looking past those lacklustre short-term indicators,
employment and new business creations are at record levels and a
purchasing power boost is around the bend.
    Together, they are evidence of more meaningful, structural
economic changes afoot that might one day, albeit not yet, help
to stem a long-term decline in France's export competitiveness.
    ""There are some shifts that are starting to crop up,"" said
economist Denis Ferrand, managing director of the Rexecode think
tank, pointing in particular to a surge in the employment rate.
    At nearly 66 percent, the proportion of people in work has
reached the highest level in records going back to late 2003,
which Ferrand said was an indication the economy's growth
potential was shifting up a gear.
    While Rexecode's growth forecast of 1.3 percent next year is
lower than the government's estimate of 1.7 percent, Ferrand's
colleagues believe that, over time, Macron's reforms will add
0.2-0.3 percentage points to annual growth.
    
    VOTERS FRUSTRATED
    Macron has promised pro-business reforms that boost
investment and jobs. But voters have grown restless in the face
of such slow growth.
    His sometimes brash leadership style, and the desertion of
several key ministers that triggered a messy reshuffle this
week, have only added to their sense of frustration.
    Yet despite such headline-grabbing setbacks, the labour
market appears to be growing stronger, even though the
unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 8.7 percent.
    People are not only getting jobs but also increasingly
signing long-term contracts, once shunned by employers who
feared they would not be able to lay workers off if business
declined.
    An overhaul of the labour code last year sought to address
such worries by making it easier to both hire and fire.
    ""You can say what you want, but when you look at what he's
done in the last 18 months, he's been very active ... He went
after big issues, like the labour market,"" said economist
Jean-Herve Lorenzi, who runs the Cercle des Economistes forum.
    Strikingly, the youth unemployment rate is dropping, despite
the fact Macron's government is slashing the number of
subsidised jobs that tended to benefit young people in the past.
    Though still high, at over 20 percent, the rate is now the
lowest since late 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.
    
    NEW BUSINESSES BOOMING
    Macron has also cut taxes on companies and capital in a move
to boost investment, innovation and risk-taking.
    Right on cue, new business creations promptly soared, and
they show no signs of slowing despite the weaker economic
outlook. A record 59,700 new businesses were set up in
September, according to the INSEE official statistics agency.
    Lorenzi cautioned, however, that ""start-ups and industrial
innovation can't make up the economy as a whole"".
    While companies and the wealthy got a tax cut, many voters
feel left out, especially as they suffered social security and
petrol tax hikes at the start of the year. An inflation surge
further squeezed their finances.
    To counter accusations of ruling for the rich, Macron's
government is now focused on boosting household purchasing
power, always an issue in France's consumer-driven economy.
[nL8N1W33GI]    
    INSEE says a cut in payroll tax this month and a cut in
municipal tax next month should boost disposable income 1.7
percent in the last three months of the year, the strongest
quarterly increase in 16 years.
    But it remains clear that France still has a long way to go.
Its share of exports from the euro zone to the world has
stagnated at 12 percent, suggesting that Macron has made little
progress in reversing its long-term competitive decline. 
    ""The day we stabilise or even win back market share will be
a sign of real structural change,"" said Ferrand. ""But that's a
structural indicator that has yet to show up.""

    MADRID, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Shares in Spanish banks rebounded
on Friday after the Supreme Court said it would review the
impact of a ruling on mortgage stamp duty after initially saying
on Thursday that banks would have to pay the tax.
    The court said that, as the ruling was a ""radical change"" in
its criteria and had an ""enormous economic and social impact"", a
senior judge agreed to suspend all pending appeals on the
matter.
    The Supreme Court ruling had unexpectedly overturned a
previous ruling from earlier this year and though it was final
it didn't state from when clients were entitled to be
compensated.
    Now the Court has to say if this new ruling would set a
judicial precedent on future rulings.
    The Spanish legal system allows customers to potentially
reclaim any compensation from tax authorities for cases going
back four years.
    Shares in all Spanish banks had suffered big declines on the
ruling on Thursday as that could leave banks potentially exposed
to additional billions of euros in legal provisions.
    On Friday, Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Bankia <BKIA.MC>,
which fell 6 percent and 4 percent, reversed losses.

    ANKARA/PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The leaders of Turkey,
Russia, Germany and France will hold a summit on the Syrian
conflict in Istanbul next week, officials said on Friday, a
month after Ankara and Moscow brokered a deal to create a
demilitarised zone in the northwest Idlib region.
    Idlib and adjacent areas are the last stronghold of rebels
who rose up against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The area
is also home to an estimated three million people, more than
half of whom have already been displaced once during the war.
    Turkey and Russia reached a deal last month to set up a
buffer zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) into rebel territory
that had to be evacuated of all heavy weapons and all jihadists
by Monday. The agreement averted a planned offensive on Idlib by
Russia, Assad's biggest outside backer.
    The four countries will hold the talks on Oct. 27 and will
discuss Idlib, and the political process for the resolution of
the Syrian conflict, the spokesman for Turkish President Tayyip
Erdogan was quoted by state-owned media as saying. [nL8N1WZ26U]
    France wants to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib,
and thereby prevent a new exodus of refugees, President Emmanuel
Macron's office said.
    ""We want to keep this stability and work from this agreement
to move into a new phase of discussions on a political process,""
one senior French diplomatic source said. ""And that it helps
launch this constitutional committee that the U.N. is working on
so that it meets as quickly as possible.""
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel will focus on the situation
in Idlib and supporting the implementation of the Sochi
agreement between Russia and Turkey, a German government
spokeswoman said.
    ""The Federal Government sees Russia, as an ally of the Assad
regime, as a partner with a very particular responsibility,"" the
spokeswoman said.
    U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said on Thursday that
Russia and Turkey plan to give more time for the implementation
of the de-escalation deal in Idlib. 
    But he cautiouned there were still ""a million unanswered
questions"" about how the deal would work, and what would happen
if groups designated as terrorists refused to lay down their
weapons. [nL8N1WY44I]
    U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said this week he would
step down at the end of November for family reasons, quitting as
the Syrian government - backed by Iran and Russia - has retaken
most of the country and a political deal remains elusive.

    KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced on Friday it
would raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter as Prime
Minister Volodymyr Groysman warned that the country risked
default if it crashed out of its International Monetary Fund aid
programme.
    Raising household gas tariffs is a key condition of IMF aid,
but Kiev had until now refused to increase them.  
    ""We have no other option to prevent extremely difficult
events,"" Groysman said during a televised cabinet meeting.
    ""If we are not able to continue cooperation with our
international partners,"" Groysman warned, then the country will
not be able to service its debt. 
    ""This may lead to the situation when Ukraine will be put
into default,"" he said.
    Ukraine's eurobonds rose across the curve following the
announcement. [nL8N1WZ4WD]  
    Ukraine was obliged to raise household gas tariffs to
qualify for more aid under a $17.5 billion IMF programme that
expires next year, when the country heads into two elections and
must service a rising debt burden.
    IMF aid has been effectively frozen since April 2017 as
Ukraine's performance on reforms slowed down and due to the
government's refusal to raise gas prices, which have been kept
artificially low since Soviet times, to market levels.
    If Ukraine receives another tranche of IMF money, that would
also allow the government to go to the market to issue new debt
and would also pave the way for the European Union and other
foreign donors to disburse more aid.
    Groysman said household gas prices would be raised by 23.5
percent from Nov 1.

    By Robin Emmott and Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Cambodia failed on Friday to
allay criticisms of authoritarianism and rights abuses that
threaten the country's duty-free trading access to the European
Union, the EU's top diplomat said after talks with its premier.
    Brussels began a formal procedure this month to strip
Cambodia of its special trade status, worth billions of euros a
year, following July elections that returned strongman Hun Sen
to power after 30 years in office and gave his party all
parliamentary seats.
    EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini held talks with
the prime minister in Brussels during a summit of 51 European
and Asian leaders. She said later she had not heard anything
that would avert trade sanctions.
    ""We discussed this, I cannot say that we found solutions to
any of these issues,"" Mogherini told a news conference. 
    ""There is a lot of concern in Europe ... about the
dissolution of the opposition and the narrowed democratic space
for political opposition and civil society.""
    The bloc's review of Cambodia's duty-free access to the EU
means Cambodian sugar, garments and other exports could face
tariffs within 12 months under EU rules and make the country
less attractive for retailers exporting to Europe. 
    EU countries accounted for around 40 percent of Cambodia's
foreign sales in 2016. Clothing factories employ around 700,000
workers. 
    Its exports to the European Union were worth 5 billion euros
($5.8 billion) last year, according to EU data, up from
negligible levels less than a decade ago, before the trade
status.

    MYANMAR ALSO ACCUSED
    Dozens of Cambodians gathered outside the summit venue in
Brussels to protest against Hun Sen's policies. 
    He declined to answer questions from reporters, waving his
hand and walking away when asked if he was concerned about the
impending sanctions.
    Mogherini also met Myanmar's Minister for International
Cooperation Kyaw Tin in Brussels and raised the prospect of
similar trade sanctions to punish the country for what the West
says is its ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims.
    A recent U.N. report accused Myanmar's military of gang
rapes and mass killings with ""genocidal intent"" in Rakhine state
and called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be
prosecuted under international law.
    Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report,
blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"" for most accounts of atrocities.
    ""We won't close our eyes to violations that the
international community sees as worrying,"" Mogherini said. ""Our
trade preferences have the respect for human rights at their
core.""

planning to toughen anti-money laundering rules by forcing
people suspected of benefiting from suspicious financial

    Up to now, prosecutors have been forced to show that wealth
was illegally obtained, but the proposal will put the burden of

Britain, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Slovakia.

2007 and 2015. [nL8N1WJ3YI]
    Earlier this month, U.S. authorities launched an

    Estonia's Anti-Money Laundering Commission has been tasked
with drawing up a set of proposals on strengthening anti-money
laundering (AML) legislative measures, which is due to be
presented to the government in October.
    The October proposals to the government will also report on
the actions of the financial regulator, the Financial
Intelligence Unit and the prosecution authority in relation to
their actions in the Danske Bank case.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May struck an upbeat tone on the Brexit talks and told business
leaders during a teleconference on Friday that EU politicians
are committed to reaching an agreement this autumn, a source
told Reuters.
    London and Brussels are racing to strike a deal by the end
of the year and firms are worried that without one, there could
be widespread disruption of everything from supply chains to
flights and the movement of food and livestock. 
    May briefed around 120 business leaders to update them on
the progress of the talks after discussions in Brussels earlier
this week. 
    ""The Prime Minister spoke for about 10 minutes and the tone

content of the call told Reuters. 
    ""She said she believed that the European leaders were very
much committed to an agreement this autumn. She said that her
aim was to wrap this up in November."" 
    May was told by some that time is pressing and heard
concerns over contingency measures which may be irreversible,
the source said. 
    She was also asked what business could do to help on Brexit,
to which she suggested firms write to lawmakers, and in Europe,
make sure leaders are aware that they need a resolution.
    Stephen Martin, director general of Institute of Directors,
who was on the call, told the BBC:
    ""She made it clear that she is very keen to get a deal as
quickly as we possibly can with the withdrawal agreement."" 
    May's office declined to offer an immediate comment when
contacted by Reuters but said it would issue a statement
shortly.

May is ready to agree to a fallback arrangement for the border
between the United Kingdom and Ireland which does not have a
time limit, to speed Brexit talks, Bloomberg reported https://bloom.bg/2R27fq6

    Arrangements for the United Kingdom's only land border with
a European Union state have proven the biggest sticking point as
London and Brussels seek to hammer out a transitional deal
before Britain leaves the European Union in March next year.
    Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, said just a week
ago that the so-called backstop designed to prevent a hard
border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland, must be finite, short and time-limited.
    However, Bloomberg reported that May and her team of Brexit
advisers now accepted the EU's point that it must be open-ended,
for an ""enduring"" solution, citing an unnamed person familiar
with the talks.
    Brexit supporters in May's government are concerned any
temporary arrangements with the EU that lack a clear time limit
may become permanent solutions over time.

    ATHENS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive
has approved Greece's first post-bailout draft budget without
requiring the implementation of legislated pension cuts, the
Greek prime minister said on Saturday.
    Athens emerged from its final international bailout in
August and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pushed to rescind
unpopular pension cuts slated for January as part of austerity
measures, claiming there is ample fiscal space to do so.
    Trailing the conservative opposition in polls, Tsipras is
counting on a less austere budget to win over voters next year,
when his term expires.
   ""The European Commission approved the Greek budget without
pension cuts after eight years of austerity,"" Tsipras said,
calling the development a ""success"".
    There was no immediate comment from the EU's executive.
    The government has argued it does not need to implement the
pension cuts agreed with creditors, as it aims to outperform on
primary surplus targets for a fifth straight year.
    Greece has promised its euro zone lenders and the
International Monetary Fund it will achieve a 3.5 percent of GDP
primary budget surplus this year, excluding debt servicing
outlays. 
    In its draft 2019 budget it targets a surplus of 4.14
percent of GDP next year. If it does not apply the pension cuts
it puts the figure at 3.56 percent. [nL8N1WH601]
    The draft budget projects economic growth will pick up to
2.5 percent in 2019 from an expected 2.1 percent this year.
    The government is now expected to submit its final draft
next month and put it on a parliamentary vote in December.

    By Valentina Za
    MILAN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Italy's ruling coalition patched
up a row over a tax amnesty on Saturday and struck a more
conciliatory tone towards EU institutions, saying it wanted to
discuss its budget plans with Brussels.
    The coalition included the tax amnesty in measures to fund
costly electoral promises that are set to sharply lift the
budget deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output next year,
flouting European Union rules that require steady progress
towards a balanced budget.
    Earlier this week, Italy brushed off criticism from Brussels
after the Commission stepped up pressure over a draft budget it
labelled an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU rules. [nL8N1WZ16J]
    But speaking after a cabinet meeting that settled the
amnesty dispute, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said
Italy had ""a comfortable place"" in Europe.
    ""We acknowledge European institutions as our counterparties
(over budget matters) ... we'll sit down around a table for a
constructive and peaceful dialogue,"" Conte told a news
conference.
    He said he would visit EU Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker in the near future to discuss the issue.
    Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini,
head of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right
League respectively, both reiterated Italy's commitment to the
single currency.
    ""We're well in Europe. There isn't and there won't be any
plan to leave the euro or the European Union,"" Salvini said.
    Salvini had rebuffed criticism over the budget earlier this
week, saying the Commission was ""a bunker under siege whose days
are counted,"" in reference to next spring's European elections.
    The government's free-spending plans prompted a credit
downgrade by Moody's on Friday, which cut Italy's sovereign debt
rating to one notch above junk status. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    Data released the same day showed foreign investors have
reduced their holdings of Italian government bonds by 67 billion
euros since May when markets first got wind of the coalition's
programme. [nL8N1WZ2E3]

    ""ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL""
    The League and the 5-Star Movement, the two parties in the
coalition, had been at odds over widening the proposed tax
amnesty to shield financial criminals, including money
launderers.
    Di Maio had accused the League of tricking its coalition
partner by surreptitiously broadening the scope of the amnesty
in the final draft of the 2019 budget. He said on television he
was ready to go to the magistrates over the incident.
    But Salvini offered to drop the measure and a compromise was
hammered out at a coalition meeting on Saturday, followed by a
cabinet meeting that approved the law decree.
    ""Three surreal days are coming to an end ... it's been a bit
tiring but all's well that ends well,"" Salvini said.
    The 5-Star has opposed tax amnesties in the past but they
are popular with the League's voter base, which traditionally
comprises self-employed businessmen. 
    Italy, which suffers from high rates of tax evasion, has
often resorted to tax amnesties to raise money.

    Talks between Britain and the European Union have stalled
over a disagreement over the backstop - an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions, if a
future trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Raab writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said
Britain's proposal to extend its Brexit transition period should
be an ""alternative"" to the insurance plan.
    ""The Prime Minister has rightly refused to rule out
considering different approaches – including extending the
implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as

Scholz has proposed a global minimum rate of corporation tax
coupled with tougher measures to prevent tax evaders from
stashing their profits in tax havens, newspaper Welt am Sonntag
reported.
    In a guest article for the Sunday paper, extracts from which
were made available on Saturday, Scholz fleshed out proposals
that he was considering jointly with France to make it harder
for international firms to evade tax.
    Both countries are seeking ways to ensure that firms like
Amazon <AMZN.O>, Apple <AAPL.O> and Google <GOOGL.O> pay
domestic taxes in proportion to the profits they earn in
Europe's largest markets, though attempts to harmonise tax rates
across the European Union have met stiff resistance from
lower-tax members like Ireland.
    ""We need a worldwide minimum tax level that no state may go
below,"" Scholz said in the article, adding that any such rules
would need to be accompanied by measures to make it harder to
move money into tax havens.
    Scholz said the internet economy ""was exacerbating a problem
that we recognise from globalisation and that we are trying to
address: the placing of profits in low-tax locations.""
    Germany, Europe's largest consumer market, is particularly
fertile ground for U.S.-based internet giants, many of which
have used offshore structures to minimise their tax exposure to
what remains a relatively high-tax economy.

    By Pawel Florkiewicz and Pawel Sobczak
    WARSAW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Poles vote in a regional election
on Sunday with gains expected for the ruling Law and Justice
(PiS) party, whose nationalist rhetoric and institutional
reforms have put the country at loggerheads with the European
Union.
    PiS swept into power in 2015 on a promise of voter-pleasing
welfare reforms, social conservatism and a bigger state role in
the economy. The party remains broadly popular, despite
accusations at home and abroad of a shift towards authoritarian
rule.
    The election is part of a larger struggle over Europe's
future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban - who like the PiS
believes the EU's powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc
and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
    While it dominates national politics, PiS controls only a
small minority of city halls, and has a majority in only one
provincial assembly out of 16.
    If successful in gaining seats, PiS will have better access
to local funding, a factor that could affect parliamentary
elections in 2019. It will also have more influence over schools
and theatres, important tools in the party's nationalist agenda.
    PiS opposes abortion, contraception and IVF fertility
treatment and wants culture and education to be more
conservative.
    At two polling stations in Warsaw, early turnout appeared
modest, but voters were expected in greater numbers after church
services ended.
    PiS supporter Urszula, 68, who cast her ballot early, said:
""It is important that those who rule locally help those who are
in the government, so that their effect is bigger.""      
    A spike in PiS support in cities, traditionally centrist
strongholds, would show its brand of populism gaining broader
appeal and would be a major upset for the Civic Platform, the
home party of European Council President Donald Tusk. 
    Opinion polls show PiS could win 33-37 percent of votes for
provincial assembly members. A coalition of centrist opposition
parties, the Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, is forecast to get
about 24 percent. Post-election coalitions could affect how many
assemblies PiS will control.
    In mayoral elections, the centrist candidate in Warsaw,
Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, is seen winning 41-42 percent of vote on
Sunday, and securing the office in a second round of voting on
Nov. 4, beating PiS' Patryk Jaki, 33.
        
    'HEADING OUT OF THE EU'?
    Voting ends at 9:00 p.m. and exit poll results are expected
shortly afterwards.
    A good result for PiS would add to concerns in Brussels
ahead of European Parliament elections in May by boosting 
eurosceptic groups that oppose moves within the bloc towards
closer integration.
    Underlining divisions, the EU's top court ordered the Warsaw
government on Friday to suspend an overhaul of the country's
Supreme Court and reinstate judges forced into early retirement.
[nL8N1WZ4G7]
    The moves were part of broader reforms of the judiciary,
which PiS says are crucial to making the system more fair and
efficient, but opponents criticise as an attack on democratic
checks and balances.
    Throughout his campaign, Warsaw's mayoral candidate Jaki has
said he sides with ordinary people against what he describes as
an arrogant Civic Platform municipal elite.
    Trzaskowski, a long-time EU emissary for his party, says he
wants his native Warsaw to remain ""open, tolerant and European"".
    On Wednesday he accused the PiS-run justice ministry, where
Jaki is a deputy minister, of following ""a straight road towards
taking Poland out of the EU.""
    Joanna, 69, who voted for Trzaskowski, said he had a better
understanding of local problems than Jaki. 
    ""I have granddaughters who I take care of, but I am worried
about their future, as I do not know what will be with Poland in
Europe with this government,"" she said.

making progress,"" Le Maire said on France 3 television on
Sunday. ""But full light needs to be shed.""
    How bilateral relations develop from here will ""depend on
the way the truth is aired, the investigation conducted and the
results established,"" Le Maire said.
    ""If they continue in this direction by establishing the
truth with a full investigation, I believe we can maintain our
strong strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia,"" he added.
    ""If that doesn't happen, nobody will understand - neither
France nor the European Union nor the United States. Saudi
Arabia is a strategic partner, but we can't have a trusting
relationship that isn't grounded in truth.""

Michel Barnier stood firm on the need for checks on goods
shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit,
while insisting this would not amount to a new border, in an
interview published on Sunday.
    Negotiations on Britain's departure from the European Union
are stalled on several issues, but primarily an Irish 'backstop'
both sides agree is needed to avoid a hard border between the UK
province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, an EU
state.
    Brussels insists that this in turn requires controls on
goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland, and is
trying to overcome objections from among UK Prime Minister
Theresa May's Conservatives and the Northern Ireland Unionists
crucial to her government's parliamentary majority. [nB5N1O400Y]
    ""Contrary to what some are saying, this is not a border we
are creating in the Irish Sea to undermine the integrity of the
United Kingdom,"" Barnier told Le Journal du Dimanche.
    Veterinary checks are already conducted on 10 percent of
livestock transported to Northern Ireland from the rest of the
UK, Barnier said. This would increase to 100 percent under the
backstop, he added, but a later animal-health agreement could
reduce the proportion inspected to 40 percent.
    Barnier said other backstop measures were needed to prevent
unauthorised Irish imports of goods such as chlorinated chicken,
produced in the U.S. but outlawed by EU food standards.
    He said other issues still preventing a deal include the
demand by Brussels that the European Court of Justice should
have jurisdiction over its implementation - as well as Britain's
reluctance to address registered designations of origin for
foodstuffs, such as champagne or Roquefort cheese.

    LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Britain could accept extending
the post-Brexit transition period by a few months if the
European Union drops its proposals for a so-called Northern
Irish backstop, Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on
Sunday.
    Talks between Britain and the EU have stalled largely over a
disagreement on the backstop - an insurance policy to ensure
there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
    The Brexit transition, or implementation period, in which
Britain would retain EU rules and so avoid border problems with
Ireland, is due to end in December 2020.
    ""If we need a bridge from the end of the implementation
period to the future relationship ... I am open minded about
using a short extension of the implementation period,"" Raab told
BBC TV.
    ""It is an obvious possible route as long as it is short,
perhaps a few months, and secondly that we know how we get out
of it and obviously it has to solve the backstop issue so that
that falls away then as a possibility.""
    In an interview published on Sunday, EU chief Brexit
negotiator Michel Barnier stood firm on the need for checks on
goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland after
Brexit, but insisted this would not amount to a new border.
[nL8N1X10IC] 
    Britain says the EU's backstop proposal of keeping Northern
Ireland in its customs union is unacceptable as it would create
a border in the Irish Sea. It favours a backstop in which the
whole of Britain would stay inside the customs union but says it
must be time-limited period or have a clear exit mechanism.
    France's Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said the EU was
still waiting for ""a workable solution"" from London.
    ""We have to have a definite answer, or at least no temporary
measures which disappear and we don’t know what to do after
that,"" she told BBC TV.    
    
    ""LAST CHANCE SALOON""  
    The possibility of extending the transition, keeping Britain
under EU governance with no say in it, is highly unpopular with
hardline supporters of Brexit and after Prime Minister Theresa
May signalled it as a possibility this week, her critics used
the Sunday newspapers to step up their attacks.
    The Sunday Times reported an ally of former Brexit minister
David Davis, who some see as an interim leader if May goes, as
saying the British leader was entering ""the killing zone"", while
it quoted an unnamed possible successor as saying ""assassination
is in the air"".
    The Mail on Sunday reported lawmakers from May's
Conservatives said she was in the ""last chance saloon"" and
should ""bring her own noose"" when she addresses Conservative
lawmakers at a meeting in parliament on Wednesday.
    A vote of no confidence in May would be triggered if 48
Conservative's lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the
party's so-called ""1922 committee"" of backbenchers demanding
such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent.
    ""We are at the end stage of the negotiation. I think it is
understandable there are jitters on all sides of this debate, we
need to hold our nerve, the end is in sight in terms of a good
deal ... I think colleagues should wait and see what that looks
like,"" said Raab. ""Now is the time to play for the team.""
    Raab said he did not know when he would next be going to
Brussels to negotiate, but a deal needed to be done by the end
of November in order to get the legislation through parliament.
    Opposition Labour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said
that even if a deal was agreed before Christmas it may not last.
    ""This idea that there will be a settlement, the issue will
be over,"" he said. ""What we are going to see is even if there is
a deal the Tory (Conservative) Party will try to rip it up next
year ... they will not stop fighting about this.""

tell parliament on Monday that 95 percent of Britain's divorce
deal has now been settled but will repeat her opposition to the
European Union's proposal for the land border with Northern
Ireland.
    Facing some of the fiercest criticism to date over her
Brexit plans after the two sides failed again to reach agreement
at a summit last week, May will try to calm passions in
parliament where her strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU
supporters alike.
    With just over five months until Britain leaves the EU,
talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern
Irish backstop, an insurance policy to ensure there will be no
return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future
trading relationship is not agreed in time. 
    But May's attempt to unlock the talks by considering an
extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current
proposed end date of December 2021 has further stirred passions
at home.
    In an attempt to highlight how much progress has been made
in more than a year of talks with the EU, she will tell
parliament the government has reached agreement on everything
from Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks.
    ""Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal
Agreement and its protocols are now settled,"" she will say,
according to excerpts from her statement to parliament.
    ""The shape of the deal across the vast majority of the
Withdrawal Agreement is now clear.""
    But the withdrawal agreement, or the terms of Britain's
divorce, cannot be signed off until the two sides agree on the
Northern Irish backstop. 
    At an EU summit last week, any such agreement seemed just as
far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and
diplomats saying May had offered nothing new to unlock the
talks. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    Since then, May's proposal to extend the transition period
has done little to calm anger among eurosceptics in the
governing Conservative Party, who fear she is leading Britain
into a deal that will make Britain a ""vassal state"" -- unable
ever to leave the EU. 
    On Sunday, Brexit minister Dominic Raab pushed the
suggestion forward, saying London could accept such a move if
the EU dropped its proposal for the backstop, which May says
would tear Northern Ireland from mainland Britain. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    May will repeat her opposition to the EU proposal - for
Northern Ireland to remain in the bloc's customs union,
potentially creating barriers to trade with the rest of Britain
- as she tries to ease growing frustration among her
parliamentary partners, a Northern Irish party.
    ""As I set out last week, the original backstop proposal from
the EU was one we could not accept, as it would mean creating a
customs border down the Irish Sea and breaking up the integrity
of the UK,"" she will say.
    ""I do not believe that any UK Prime Minister could ever
accept this. And I certainly will not.""

    * Macronometer graphic package: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JH3um9
    * Employment and business creations at record levels
    * Household income boost expected from tax cuts
    * French competitiveness yet to show improvement

    By Leigh Thomas
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - While France has experienced
political turbulence and disappointing economic data in recent
months, beneath the surface are signs of deeper change that
suggest President Emmanuel Macron's reform drive is starting to
bear fruit.
    For much of this year, the 40-year-old president and former
investment banker has had to endure less-than-thrilling news on
the economic front, with consumer and business confidence
wilting and the growth outlook souring.
    But looking past those lacklustre short-term indicators,
employment and new business creations are at record levels and a
purchasing power boost is around the bend.
    Together, they are evidence of more meaningful, structural
economic changes afoot that might one day, albeit not yet, help
to stem a long-term decline in France's export competitiveness.
    ""There are some shifts that are starting to crop up,"" said
economist Denis Ferrand, managing director of the Rexecode think
tank, pointing in particular to a surge in the employment rate.
    At nearly 66 percent, the proportion of people in work has
reached the highest level in records going back to late 2003,
which Ferrand said was an indication the economy's growth
potential was shifting up a gear.
    While Rexecode's growth forecast of 1.3 percent next year is
lower than the government's estimate of 1.7 percent, Ferrand's
colleagues believe that, over time, Macron's reforms will add
0.2-0.3 percentage points to annual growth.
    
    VOTERS FRUSTRATED
    Macron has promised pro-business reforms that boost
investment and jobs. But voters have grown restless in the face
of such slow growth.
    His sometimes brash leadership style, and the desertion of
several key ministers that triggered a messy reshuffle this
week, have only added to their sense of frustration.
    Yet despite such headline-grabbing setbacks, the labour
market appears to be growing stronger, even though the
unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 8.7 percent.
    People are not only getting jobs but also increasingly
signing long-term contracts, once shunned by employers who
feared they would not be able to lay workers off if business
declined.
    An overhaul of the labour code last year sought to address
such worries by making it easier to both hire and fire.
    ""You can say what you want, but when you look at what he's
done in the last 18 months, he's been very active ... He went
after big issues, like the labour market,"" said economist
Jean-Herve Lorenzi, who runs the Cercle des Economistes forum.
    Strikingly, the youth unemployment rate is dropping, despite
the fact Macron's government is slashing the number of
subsidised jobs that tended to benefit young people in the past.
    Though still high, at over 20 percent, the rate is now the
lowest since late 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.
    
    NEW BUSINESSES BOOMING
    Macron has also cut taxes on companies and capital in a move
to boost investment, innovation and risk-taking.
    Right on cue, new business creations promptly soared, and
they show no signs of slowing despite the weaker economic
outlook. A record 59,700 new businesses were set up in
September, according to the INSEE official statistics agency.
    Lorenzi cautioned, however, that ""start-ups and industrial
innovation can't make up the economy as a whole"".
    While companies and the wealthy got a tax cut, many voters
feel left out, especially as they suffered social security and
petrol tax hikes at the start of the year. An inflation surge
further squeezed their finances.
    To counter accusations of ruling for the rich, Macron's
government is now focused on boosting household purchasing
power, always an issue in France's consumer-driven economy.
[nL8N1W33GI]    
    INSEE says a cut in payroll tax this month and a cut in
municipal tax next month should boost disposable income 1.7
percent in the last three months of the year, the strongest
quarterly increase in 16 years.
    But it remains clear that France still has a long way to go.
Its share of exports from the euro zone to the world has
stagnated at 12 percent, suggesting that Macron has made little
progress in reversing its long-term competitive decline. 
    ""The day we stabilise or even win back market share will be
a sign of real structural change,"" said Ferrand. ""But that's a
structural indicator that has yet to show up.""

    By Karin Strohecker
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares gained on Monday
amid relief over Italy's budget, following rallies in Asia after
China promised to provide stimulus to stabilise its economy and
offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.
    Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of
support for stock markets in the world's second-largest economy
saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three
years [nL3N1X206H][L3N1X21FI]. Shanghai blue chips <.CSI300>
jumped around 4.5 percent, adding to Friday's bounce on
Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. 
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere
in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains. <.HSI> <.MIAPJ0000PUS>
<.TWII>.     
    European stocks <.STOXX> opened higher after Moody's kept
Italy's sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of cutting it
to negative. The decision fuelled a rally in Italian government
bonds and boosted shares in the country's banks.
    ""Moody's opens the door for a euro bounce, while Chinese
verbal support for the economy and markets has given us a
risk-friendly mood to start the week,"" Societe Generale said in
a note to clients. 
    The mood looked to spill over into U.S. markets, where
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 <ESc1> were 0.4 percent higher
while Nasdaq's <NQc1> added 0.7 percent. 
    This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season,
with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the
companies reporting [nL2N1WY22W].
    Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P
500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the
third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
    ""The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being
'strong' and the vast majority of companies will exceed
consensus expectations,"" said analysts at JPMorgan in a note.
    ""However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form
of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all
the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a
turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.""
   The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the
first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who
cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial
conditions would trigger the next downturn [nL3N1WY2Q9].

    ITALIAN RELIEF
    On currency markets, the euro sailed higher <EUR=> against
the dollar after the Moody's report. It also benefited from
comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who
reiterated the country does not intend to leave the single
currency. 
    Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields
enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June. [nL8N1X216H]
    But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European
Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its
budget, possibly leading to sanctions. [nL8N1X10UW]
    The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday
to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first
time ever, a government source said on Sunday.
    Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European
Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain
to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about
its reinvestment policy until December [nL3N1WZ47X].
    The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies at 95.578 <.DXY> [USD/] while sterling idled at
$1.3081 <GBP=> as the market waited for more developments on
Brexit.
    Prime Minister Theresa May will tell parliament that 95
percent of Britain's divorce deal has now been settled. But she
will repeat her opposition to the EU's proposal for the land
border with Northern Ireland and many see the risk of a
leadership challenge being mounted [nL8N1X10YY].
    Saudi Arabia also remained in the spotlight after Riyadh
called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a ""huge and
grave mistake"" but sought to shield its powerful crown prince
from the crisis [nL8N1X10M8] [nL2N1X107K] [nL2N1X1068].
    U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders are pushing
Saudi Arabia for more answers. 
    In commodity markets, Brent crude futures <LCOc1> climbed
past op $80 per barrel, with U.S. sanctions against Iran's crude
exports due to be implemented next month. [O/N]
    Gold prices edged higher towards the 2 1/2-month peak hit
last week <XAU=> [nL3N1X21L0].

finances last year, achieving a general government surplus of
0.8 percent of gross domestic product compared to a revised 0.5
percent of GDP surplus in 2016, the country's statistics agency
ELSTAT said on Monday.
    Under ESA 2010 guidelines, the general government's primary
balance, which excludes debt servicing outlays, reached a
surplus of 3.9 percent of economic output last year, slightly
lower than a 4.0 percent reading issued in April.
    Still the primary busget surplus improved from 3.7 percent
of economic output in 2016.
    ELSTAT did not calculate a figure for the primary budget
balance under the country's bailout programme, where there is a
different statistical treatment on some expenditure and revenue
items.
    Under the bailout programme, Greece's primary surplus target
last year was 1.75 percent of GDP. The target for this year is
3.5 percent of GDP.
    ELSTAT also said Greece's general government debt eased to
176.1 percent of GDP last year from 178.5 percent in 2016.

    Oct 22 (Reuters) - Emerging market equities rose on Monday
led by blue-chip Chinese stocks which rallied to their biggest
one-day gain in almost three years, while a weaker dollar
bolstered most developing market currencies, with South Africa's
rand firming 1 percent.
    Chinese stocks <.SSEC> <.CSI300> rose more than 4 percent,
extending Friday's gains, on the promise of more stimulus as
China revealed tax change measures to support the economy and
companies. [nL3N1WZ1AA]
    That helped MSCI's emerging market stock index <.MSCIEF>
gain more than 1 percent, with most stock markets from Taiwan
<.TWII> to South Africa <.JTOPI> moving higher.
    In a week that will see numerous central bank meetings, most
emerging market currencies also firmed against a largely weaker
dollar as the euro strengthened due to easing concern over
Italy.[FRX/]    
    ""We might have a bit more positive sentiment this week given
that we have had some of the big issues out of our way,"" said
Jakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske
Bank.    
    Emerging markets have been under pressure this year with
Chinese stocks down 19 percent, hit by the U.S.-China trade
stand-off, tensions with Saudi Arabia and the West and
uncertainly about the global growth outlook. 
    Among currencies, Turkey's lira <TRY=> weakened slightly,
and the Russian rouble <RUB=> firmed ahead of respective central
bank meetings later this week at which analysts expect interest
rates to be left unchanged. [nL8N1WZ5Q7] 
    South Africa's rand <ZAR=> climbed with attention focused on
its medium-term budget policy statement, which is due on
Wednesday. New Finance Minister Tito Mboweni will stick closely
to previous budget forecasts for the coming two fiscal years,
with only slight slippages due to poor revenues, economists
predicted in a Reuters poll. [nL8N1WW2TV]
    ""The focus will be on the balance between growth supporting
measures and debt sustainability. Therefore, we believe all the
attention would be on the structure of expenditures and
Treasury's economic growth forecasts,"" Credit Suisse analysts
said about the budget in a briefing note.
    Most Eastern European peers including the Polish zloty
<EURPLN=> and Czech crown <EURCZK=> steadied on news that
Moody's had kept Italian government's credit rating outlook at

    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio also reiterated
that the government has no intention of leaving the Euro.

sources for self-consumption in France until 2020. 
    The European Commission said the French government's support
programme would contribute to add 490 megawatts of new capacity
and was available for small installations. The selected
installations would receive a premium on top of the market price
over 10 years, it said.

the third quarter on a dip in car manufacturing but the drivers
of its recent expansion remain in place, so growth should
rebound in the final three months of the year, the Bundesbank
said on Monday.
    With the European Union implementing a new motor vehicle
emissions certification system, German auto makers struggled to
gain regulatory clearance while production was also dampened by
big dealership discounts to clear stock before the new rules
came into effect.
    Germany has been the engine of the euro zone's five-year
growth run and its recent wobbles have increased worries that
growth cycle may be coming to a premature end, before some
countries have had time to fully recover from the bloc's debt
crisis less than a decade ago.
    ""The economic upswing in Germany is still fundamentally
intact,"" the Bundesbank said in a regular monthly economic
report. 
    ""Business climate improved noticeably in the third quarter,
according to the Ifo Institute, so a significant expansion of
economic output is expected for the current quarter,"" the bank
added.
    Still, third quarter growth figures, due to be published in
mid-November, are likely to be sluggish as retail sales were
modest and construction output pulled back from earlier highs,
exacerbating the hit to growth from a big drop in industrial
production. 
    The car industry's struggles continued until the end of the
quarter but other segments of industry fared better and the
backlog of industrial orders also remained high, the Bundesbank
added.
    The German government recently cut its 2018 growth forecast
to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent and also lowered the 2019
projection to 1.8 percent from 2.1 percent, citing the impact of
global trade disputes, labour shortages and the auto sector’s
difficulties. [nL8N1WR30F]

    By Karin Strohecker and Tom Wilson
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares crept higher on
Monday on relief over Italy's budget, tracking rallies in Asia
markets after China promised to provide stimulus to stabilise
its economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.
    Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of
support for stock markets in the world's second-largest economy
saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three
years [nL3N1X206H][L3N1X21FI]. Shanghai blue chips <.CSI300>
jumped around 4.3 percent, adding to Friday's bounce on
Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. 
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere
in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains. <.HSI> <.MIAPJ0000PUS>
<.TWII>.     
    European stocks <.STOXX> climbed 0.2 percent after Moody's
kept Italy's sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of
cutting it to negative. The decision fuelled a rally in Italian
government bonds and boosted shares in the country's banks.
[nL8N1X21L1]
    The Moody's report and China's verbal support for its
economy helped markets look beyond worries over the impact on
global growth from policy tightening by the Federal reserve and
the U.S.-China trade war, market participants said. 
    ""It looks like the Chinese authorities will do what they can
to stem the negative effects of those factors,"" said Investec
economist Victoria Clarke. 
    The mood was set to travel to U.S. markets, where E-Mini
futures for the S&P 500 <ESc1> were 0.1 percent higher. Nasdaq's
<NQc1> added 0.4 percent. 
    This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season,
with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the
companies reporting [nL2N1WY22W].
    Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P
500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the
third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
    ""The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being
'strong' and the vast majority of companies will exceed
consensus expectations,"" said analysts at JPMorgan in a note.
    ""However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form
of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all
the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a
turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.""
    The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the
first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who
cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial
conditions would trigger the next downturn. [nL3N1WY2Q9]

    ITALIAN RELIEF
    On currency markets, the euro <EUR=> rallied after the
Moody's report before pairing gains. By late morning it was down
0.1 percent at $1.15. 
    The single currency has benefited from comments by Italian
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who reiterated the country
does not intend to leave the euro. 
    Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields
enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June. [nL8N1X216H]
    But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European
Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its
budget, a move that could lead to sanctions. [nL8N1X10UW]
    The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday
to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first
time ever, a government source said on Sunday.
    Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European
Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain
to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about
its reinvestment policy until December [nL3N1WZ47X].
    The dollar was up 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies
at 95.796 <.DXY> [USD/] 
    Sterling, meanwhile, slipped 0.4 percent to $1.3022 <GBP=>
as Brexit worries rose ahead of a speech to Britain's parliament
by Prime Minister Theresa May. [nL8N1X2283]
    Though May will tell parliament that 95 percent of Britain's
divorce deal has been agreed, she will repeat her opposition to
the European Union's proposal for the land border with Northern
Ireland. [nL8N1X10YY].
    The border issue scuppered efforts to reach a Brexit deal at
last week's EU summit, and many see the risk of a challenge to
her leadership being mounted. 
    Saudi Arabia also remained in the spotlight after Riyadh
called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a ""huge and
grave mistake"" but sought to shield its powerful crown prince
from the crisis. [nL8N1X10M8] [nL2N1X107K] [nL2N1X1068]
    U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders are pushing
Saudi Arabia for more answers. 
    In commodity markets, Brent crude futures <LCOc1> edged
above $80 per barrel, with U.S. sanctions against Iran's crude
exports due to be implemented next month. [O/N]
    Gold prices edged higher towards the 2 1/2-month peak hit
last week <XAU=> [nL3N1X21L0].

    ROME, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury told the European
Commission on Monday it would stick to its contested budget
plans in defiance of EU fiscal rules, but promised to intervene
if it failed to meet its debt and deficit goals.
    In a letter to the Commission, Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria said he recognised that the 2019 budget, which is set to
hike next year's fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), was not in line with the EU Stability and Growth
Pact. 
    However, he said the government had to respond to years of
economic underperformance, adding it did not intend to further
expand the budget deficit in 2020 and 2021.
    ""(The budget) was a hard, but necessary decision in light of
Italy's delay in catching up to pre-crisis levels of GDP and the
desperate economic conditions in which the most disadvantaged
citizens find themselves in,"" Tria wrote. 
    ""The government trusts that what it has explained is
sufficient to clear up the setup of its budget and that the
(fiscal) law will not put at risk the financial stability of
Italy or other EU state members,"" he added.
    The European Commission sent Rome a warning letter about the
budget last week -- the first formal step of a procedure that
could lead to Brussels rejecting the fiscal package and imposing
fines on Italy.
    An EU spokesman said on Monday that the European Commission
would discuss and decide on Tuesday the next steps in the
procedure for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget. [nB5N1VQ00I]

defended on Monday Italy's 2019 budget, which has fallen foul of

    In a wide-ranging news conference, Conte said he wanted
constructive dialogue with the Commission over the contested
fiscal package, and predicted that growth would ""take off"" once
government reforms were implemented.
    He pledged that next year's deficit would not exceed 2.4
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and dismissed any
suggestion that Italy might have to abandon the euro currency or
leave the European Union.

watchdog, BaFin, said on Monday it would negotiate its own
regulatory ties with its British counterpart to avoid market
disruption if Britain and the European Union fail to reach
broader agreements before Brexit.
    EU financial regulators are hoping to agree multilateral
memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with Britain's Financial
Conduct Authority to avoid a disorderly Brexit wreaking havoc.
    But progress on that broader effort partly hinges on whether
and when Britain and the EU agree final terms of a divorce
settlement and the outline of future trading terms before Brexit
in March. An EU summit this month failed to secure agreement on
these.
    In the first sign that a national regulator in the EU was
leaving nothing to chance and is willing to go it alone, BaFin's
deputy president, Elisabeth Roegele, said the watchdog was
examining fall-back scenarios.
    Those could include a bilateral agreement between BaFin and
UK regulators to “ensure the smoothest possible transition,” she
said.    
    Britain and EU regulators are trying to agree deals on a
wide range of areas to allow funds in one country to be managed
by staff in another country, and to clear the way for other
forms of outsourcing and the transfer of risks between
operations in different countries.
    Roegele said EU and UK regulators should agree at an “early
stage” on a procedure for consultation, cooperation and exchange
of information in the field of securities trading.
    “Such a commitment to transparency, market integrity and
investor protection serves to ensure the smooth functioning of
financial markets and financial stability and to maintain the
necessary confidence of market participants, especially
investors,” she said in a statement.
    Banks have said that Brussels is dragging its feet on
agreeing regulatory cooperation agreements in order to pile
pressure on lenders to staff new hubs in the EU before March and
shift the contracts to them. [nL8N1WY722]
    The chairman of France's markets watchdog AMF, Robert
Ophele, had said that cooperation agreements for supervising
cross-border asset managers will be in place before Britain
leaves the European Union next March. 
    ""This type of MOU is very easy to write. We have them with
many many countries and they all look the same,"" he had
said.[nL8N1WH336]

    * Amendment would in effect make EU's backstop plan illegal
    * DUP has no immediate comment on Telegraph report

 (Adds government comment, detail)
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Northern Irish party which
props up British Prime Minister Theresa May will back an
amendment proposed by rebel Brexiteer lawmakers that will
effectively make the European Union's backstop proposal illegal,
a Telegraph newspaper reporter said.
    Brexit talks have stalled over a disagreement on the
so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
    May has rejected the EU's proposal - for Northern Ireland to
remain in the bloc's customs union - as it would potentially
create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain.
    Prominent Brexiteer Steve Baker, a former junior Brexit
minister, will try to block the EU's backstop plan on Wednesday
by attaching amendments to legislation passing through
parliament.
    Northern Ireland has been without a fully functioning
executive since January 2017, and Baker's amendment would
prevent officials acting in the absence of a devolved government
to implement any trade or regulatory barriers between Northern
Ireland and mainland Britain.    
    ""DUP will back amendment being tabled by Tory Eurosceptics
on Wednesday that will effectively make the EU’s NI backstop
illegal,"" Steven Swinford, the Telegraph's deputy political
editor, said on Twitter. 
    ""Yet another headache for No. 10, with 40 Tory MP already
poised to support it.""
    The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 lawmakers provide
May with a slim working majority in parliament, say the EU's
backstop proposal would tear Northern Ireland from the rest of
Britain. The DUP had no immediate comment on the report.
    Only seven Conservative lawmakers have to rebel for May to
lose a vote in parliament, if all opposition party lawmakers
vote against the government, so if 40 Conservatives backed the
amendment the DUP's decision would not sway the outcome.
    But the scale of votes against the government could provide
an indication of how many may ultimately refuse to back any
final Brexit deal with the EU when it is voted on in parliament.
    The Times reported that the opposition Labour Party was
likely to abstain on the amendment, however, meaning the
government would still win the vote. A spokesman for the Labour
Party said it would make a decision later on Monday.
    May's spokesman said the government would look at the
amendments ""in the usual way"". 
    ""It's worth pointing out the legislation's purpose: it is
necessary to provide the Northern Ireland civil service with the
certainty and clarity they need to continue to deliver public
services,"" he told reporters.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Spain's Supreme Court sought on
Monday to clarify who was responsible for paying stamp duty on
mortgages, upholding a ruling last week that banks were
responsible while saying it would make a final decision on who
should pay it in future early next month.
    Spanish bank shares fell on Thursday after the Supreme Court
unexpectedly overturned an earlier ruling in a case which
analysts estimate could cost them between 1.7 billion and 10
billion euros ($2-$11.5 billion) in compensation.
    Although banking shares recovered some of their losses on
Friday after Spain's highest court said it would review the
criteria and the impact of the stamp duty, which applies to the
value of the mortgage taken out on a property, they fell again
on Monday as it said the ruling was final. [nL8N1WY30D]
    However, it did not state from when clients were entitled to
be compensated or who would foot the bill in the future, with
shares in Bankia <BKIA.MC> falling 4.5 percent and Banco
Sabadell <SABE.MC> dropping by 4.9 percent.
    The back and forth over the decision by the Supreme Court
could have an impact on banks' mortgage lending business and has
prompted the Spanish banking association AEB to demand greater
legal security and predictable rules.
    A source at a Spanish bank said that some clients were now
visiting branches asking for clauses to be added to their
mortgage contracts, while others were even considering delaying
their decisions over signing new home loans.
    Although last week's ruling does not state from when clients
are entitled to be compensated, the Spanish legal systems allows
customers to potentially claim compensation from tax authorities
for cases going back four years.
    Gestha, a union of tax inspectors, on Monday estimated that
around 1.5 million clients could be entitled to claim 3.6
billion euros for the last four years from Spain's tax agency or
regional authorities.
    The ruling comes at a sensitive moment for Spanish banks as
they struggle to glean earnings from loans with interest rates
at historic lows and as increasing competition erodes margins.  
    It is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders after a
European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that banks had
to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with interest
rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Supreme Court said the final ruling would be made on
Nov. 30.

422,1529,1965,4715,94e5add55d00efc91ddbd1c830f7220b,INSIGHT-How the man behind Khashoggi murder ran the killing via Skype,2018-10-23 1:51:24,EUR,0.94771,2018-10-23 1:51:37,"{'USD': 'Positive', 'EUR': 'Positive'}","    Oct 22 (Reuters) - He ran social media for Saudi Arabia's
crown prince. He masterminded the arrest of hundreds of his
country's elite. He detained a Lebanese prime minister. And,
according to two intelligence sources, he ran journalist Jamal
Khashoggi's brutal killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by
giving orders over Skype.
    Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman, is one of the fall guys as Riyadh tries to stem
international outrage at Khashoggi’s death. On Saturday, Saudi
state media said King Salman had sacked Qahtani and four other
officials over the killing carried out by a 15-man hit team.
    But Qahtani's influence in the crown prince's entourage has
been so vast over the past three years - his own rise tracking
that of his boss - that it will be hard for Saudi officials to
paint Qahtani as the mastermind of the murder without also
raising questions about the involvement of Prince Mohammed,
according to several sources with links to the royal court.
    ""This episode won't topple MbS, but it has hit his image
which will take a long time to be repaired if it ever does. The
king is protecting him,"" one of the sources with ties to the
royal court said.
    Qahtani himself once said he would never do anything without
his boss' approval.
    ""Do you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an
employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the
king and my lord the faithful crown prince,"" Qahtani tweeted
last summer.
    Qahtani did not respond to questions from Reuters. His
biography on Twitter changed in recent days from royal adviser
to chairman of the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity,
Programming and Drones, a role he had held before.
    Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the operation that led
to Khashoggi's death and ""certainly did not order a kidnapping
or murder of anybody"", a Saudi official said on Saturday.
Officials in Riyadh could not be reached for further comment.
    As the crisis has grown over the past three weeks, Saudi
Arabia has changed its tune on Khashoggi's fate, first denying
his death, then saying he died during a brawl at the consulate,
and now attributing the death to a chokehold.
    A senior Saudi official told Reuters that the killers had
tried to cover up what happened, contending that the truth was
only now emerging. The Turks reject that version of the story,
saying they have audio recordings of what happened.
    The kingdom has survived other crises in the past year,
including the fallout of the crown prince's short-lived
kidnapping of Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri in 2017.
Hariri, too, was verbally humiliated and beaten, according to
eight Saudi, Arab and Western diplomatic sources. The man
leading that interrogation: Saud al-Qahtani.
    France intervened to free Hariri, but Western capitals did
not take Riyadh to task for detaining a head of government - and
Prince Mohammed emerged emboldened, according to these Saudi
sources.
    This time is different, with some Western capitals
increasingly critical of the murder and the Saudi explanation.
    Germany has announced it will stop arms sales, while
Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement asking for
an ""urgent … clarification of exactly what happened Oct 2.""
    President Donald Trump has swung between saying he is
unhappy with the Saudi investigation but also that he does not
want to jeopardise U.S. arms sales to the country.
    
    SKYPE CALL
    To stem the fallout of the Khashoggi killing, the crown
prince, commonly known by his initials MbS, allowed Qahtani to
take the fall, according to one source close to the Saudi royal
court. 
    A second senior Saudi official said Qahtani had been
detained following his sacking by royal decree, but he continued
to tweet afterwards. The sources with links to the royal court
said he was not believed to be under arrest.
    In the Khashoggi killing, Qahtani was present as he has been
in other key moments of MbS's administration. This time, though,
his presence was virtual.
    Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Saudi journalist often critical of
Saudi Arabia and its leadership, walked into the Istanbul
consulate at around 1 pm on Oct 2, to pick up some documents
that would allow him to marry. 
    Turkish security sources say he was immediately seized
inside the consulate by 15 Saudi intelligence operatives who had
flown in on two jets just hours before.
    According to one high-ranking Arab source with access to
intelligence and links to members of Saudi Arabia’s royal court,
Qahtani was beamed into a room of the Saudi consulate via Skype.
    He began to hurl insults at Khashoggi over the phone.
According to the Arab and Turkish sources, Khashoggi answered
Qahtani’s insults with his own. But he was no match for the
squad, which included top security and intelligence operatives,
some with direct links to the royal court.
    A Turkish intelligence source relayed that at one point
Qahtani told his men to dispose of Khashoggi. ""Bring me the head
of the dog"", the Turkish intelligence source says Qahtani
instructed.               
    It is not clear if Qahtani watched the entire proceedings,
which the high-ranking Arab source described as a ""bungled and
botched operation"".
    The Arab source and the Turkish intelligence source said the
audio of the Skype call is now in the possession of Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan. The sources say he is refusing to
release it to the Americans.
    Erdogan said on Sunday he would release information about
the Turkish investigation during a weekly speech on Tuesday.
Three Turkish officials reached by Reuters declined to comment
ahead of that speech.
    The senior Saudi official who laid out the official version
of events – that Khashoggi had got into a fight – said he had
not heard about Qahtani appearing via Skype, but that the Saudi
investigation was ongoing.
    
    QAHTANI’S RISE
    Qahtani, 40, has earned a reputation at home as both a
violent enforcer of princely whims and as a strident
nationalist. In blogs and on social media, some liberal Saudi
journalists and activists dubbed him the Saudi Steve Bannon for
his aggressive manipulation of the news media and
behind-the-scenes strategizing.
    Qahtani wrote odes on Twitter to the royal family under the
pen name Dari, which means predator in Arabic. Some of his
opponents on social media call him Dalim, a figure in Arabic
folklore who rose from being a lowly servant to much greater
heights.
    According to his biography on his Twitter account, Qahtani
studied law and made the rank of captain in the Saudi air force.
After launching a blog, he caught the eye of Khaled al-Tuwaijri,
the former head of the royal court, who hired him in the early
2000s to run an electronic media army tasked with protecting
Saudi Arabia’s image , according to a source with ties to the
royal court.
    Tuwaijri is under house arrest and could not be reached for
comment.
    Qahtani rose to further prominence after latching onto
Prince Mohammed, who was part of his father Salman's court as
Riyadh governor, then crown prince and finally king in 2015
    Tasked with countering alleged Qatari influence on social
media, Qahtani used Twitter to attack criticism of the kingdom
in general and Prince Mohammed in particular. He also ran a
WhatsApp group with local newspaper editors and prominent
journalists, dictating the royal court’s line.
    When Riyadh led an economic boycott against Qatar in June
2017, Qahtani ramped up his attacks on the small Gulf state.
Online, he urged Saudis to tweet the names of anyone showing
sympathy with Qatar under the Arabic hashtag ""The Black List"".
    The high-ranking Arab official and Saudi sources with ties
to the royal court said Qahtani was MbS's ""bad cop"" late last
year when 200 people, including Saudi princes, ministers and
business tycoons, were detained and put under house arrest at
the Ritz Carlton in an anti-corruption sweep. Qahtani oversaw
some of the interrogations, the Arab official said.
    
    A KIDNAPPING
    The extent of Qahtani’s power is perhaps best illustrated by
the kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri last
year, several of the Saudi and Arab diplomatic sources said.
    The Saudis were incensed at the inability of Hariri, a Sunni
Muslim and a Saudi client, to stand up to their regional rival
Iran and Hezbollah, the Shi'ite paramilitary movement that acts
as Tehran’s spearhead in the region. Hariri belonged to the same
multi-party coalition government as Hezbollah.
    The Saudis were particularly dismayed that Hariri had failed
to deliver a message to a top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to stop interfering in Lebanon and
Yemen. Hariri claimed he had delivered the Saudi message, but an
informer, planted by Qahtani in Hariri's circle, gave the Saudis
the minutes of the meeting which showed that he had not done so.
    The Saudis lured Hariri to Riyadh for a meeting with MbS.
Upon his arrival on Nov. 3, 2017, there was no line-up of Saudi
princes or officials, as would typically greet a prime minister
on an official visit. Hariri later received a call that the
meeting with the crown prince would take place the next day at a
royal compound.
    When Hariri arrived, he was ushered into a room where
Qahtani was waiting for him with a security team, according to
three Arab sources familiar with the incident. The security team
beat Hariri; Qahtani cursed at him and then forced him to resign
as prime minister in a statement that was broadcast by a
Saudi-owned TV channel.
    ""He (Qahtani) told him you have no choice but to resign and
read this statement,"" said one of the sources. ""Qahtani oversaw
the interrogation and ill-treatment of Hariri.""
    Another source said it was the intervention of French
President Emmanuel Macron that secured his release following an
international outcry.
    Macron claimed credit in May for ending the crisis, saying
an unscheduled stopover in Riyadh to convince MbS, followed by
an invitation to Hariri to come to France, had been the catalyst
to resolving it. Lebanese officials confirmed to Reuters that
Macron's quick intervention secured Hariri's return.
    Saudi officials could not be reached for comment about the
sequence of events or Qahtani's involvement. French officials
declined to comment when asked about Qahtani's role.
             
    AN OFFER TO RETURN HOME
    At least three friends of Khashoggi told Reuters that in the
months after the journalist moved to Washington a year ago he
received multiple phone calls from MbS’s right-hand man urging
him to return to Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi had balked, they said,
fearing reprisals for his Washington Post columns and outspoken
views.
    Qahtani had tried to reassure the former newspaper editor
that he was still well respected and had offered the journalist
a job as a consultant at the royal court, the friends said.
    Khashoggi said that while he found Qahtani gentle and polite
during those conversations, he did not trust him, one close
friend told Reuters. ""Jamal told me afterwards, 'he thinks that
I will go back so that he can throw me in jail?"" 
    The second senior Saudi official confirmed that Qahtani had
spoken to Khashoggi about returning home. The ambush in Istanbul
seems to have been another way to get him home.
    How much did the crown prince know about his trusted aide’s
plan to abduct Khashoggi? 
    Most of the 15 hit-man team identified by Turkish and Saudi
authorities worked for the kingdom's security and intelligence
services, military, government ministries, royal court security
and air force. One of them, General Maher Mutreb, a senior
intelligence officer, who is part of the security team of Prince
Mohammed, appeared in photographs with him on official visits
earlier this year to the United States and Europe.
    The high-ranking Arab official and the Turkish intelligence
source said it was Mutreb's phone that was used to dial in
Qahtani while Khashoggi was being interrogated. 
    Reuters tried to contact members of 15-man team but their
phones were either switched off, on voicemail or no longer in
service.
    The Saudi official said Deputy Intelligence Chief General
Ahmed al-Asiri put together the 15-man squad from the
intelligence and security forces. Asiri was one of the five
officials dismissed on Saturday.
    Another key figure was Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy, a forensic
expert specialised in autopsies attached to the Saudi Ministry
of Interior. His presence – equipped with a bone-saw Turkish
sources say was used to dismember the journalist – is hard to
explain in an operation Saudi officials now say was aimed at
persuading Khashoggi to return home.
    It is hard to imagine that the crown prince could have not
known about such a delicate operation, the Saudi sources with
ties to the royal court say.
    The Saudi official who spoke on Saturday said an existing
standing order provided authorisation to ""negotiate"" with
dissidents to return home without requiring approval, but that
the team involved with Khashoggi exceeded that authorisation.
    Another Saudi official close to the investigation said that
Qahtani decided on his own to organise Khashoggi’s kidnapping
and that he asked Asiri to get a team together, but that their
plans had gone wrong.
    Qahtani's final act may be to serve his boss by assuming the
responsibility for the crisis that has hit Saudi Arabia since
Khashoggi's murder. The Saudi king has sacked Qahtani and
ordered a restructuring of the general intelligence agency. 
    To head it, he named MbS.

control of the northern Italian province of Trento, ousting the
centre-left coalitions that have ruled for decades, in the
latest breakthrough by the anti-immigrant party.
    The League's junior health minister Maurizio Fugatti was
elected provincial governor on Monday with almost 47 percent of
the vote, backed by a coalition including Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and local civic lists. 
    The League, led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini,
garnered more than 27 percent, almost twice as much as the
centre-left Democratic Party and quadrupling its vote at the
previous regional election in 2013.
    The League, which won 17 percent of the vote at a national
election in March, has seen its popularity surge on the back of
a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration, and is now
Italy's leading party with more than 30 percent, according to
opinion polls.
    Trento is one of the two provinces in the region of Trentino
Alto Adige, which enjoys autonomous legislative and
administrative powers that give it a significant degree of
independence from the central government.
    In German-speaking Alto Adige, the region's other province,
the Südtiroler Volkspartei (SVP) - a local party which normally
governs with the centre left - led the way with almost 42
percent of the vote. The League got 11 percent.
    The SVP is now widely expected to govern Trentino Alto Adige
with the League.
    ""For the first time in the history of Trento and Alto Adige
the PD and the left will pack their bags and go home,"" Salvini
said on Twitter.

    ORTENBERG, Germany, Oct 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor
Angela Merkel on Monday called the killing of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a ""monstrosity"" and
vowed to halt all German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the
case is cleared up.
    Merkel decried what she called ""the monstrosity there in the
Saudi consulate in Turkey"".
    ""It must be cleared up. As long as it's not cleared up,
there will be no arms exports to Saudi Arabia. I assure you of
that very decidedly,"" Merkel said at a campaign rally in the
town of Ortenberg ahead of elections in the state of Hesse.
    Riyadh has given multiple and conflicting accounts on what
led to Khashoggi's death. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Adel
al-Jubeir called the killing a ""huge and grave mistake"" but
sought to shield Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince.
[nL8N1X10M8]
    Merkel first called for a stop to arms exports on Sunday,
raising questions about whether that would also affect weapons
deliveries that had previously been approved. Her spokesman told
reporters earlier on Monday that was being reviewed.
    Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's conservatives and
head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said it was
clear that all deliveries of weapons to Saudi Arabia should be
halted.
    ""Even those deals that were already approved cannot happen
now, as long as the case has not been resolved, and as long as
there have been no substantial consequences in Riyadh,"" Roettgen
told broadcaster ZDF. ""We would completely lose our
credibility.""
    Economy Minister Peter Altmaier earlier had called on other
European Union member states to follow its example.
    ""The government is in agreement that we will not approve
further arms exports for the moment because we want to know what
happened,"" Atmaier told broadcaster ZDF.
    So far this year the German government approved weapons
exports worth more than 400 million euros ($462 million) to
Saudi Arabia, making it the second-biggest recipient of German
arms after Algeria.

replacement of its flagship aircraft carrier the Charles de
Gaulle at the start of 2020, its armed forces minister said on
Tuesday.  
   The carrier has been in service since 2001 but Paris is
looking to build a vessel that would take into consideration
expected technological advances post-2030 and be capable of
carrying a planned new Franco-German fighter jet.
    ""The Charles de Gaulle will need a successor,"" Florence
Parly said in a speech at a defence exhibition in Paris.
    ""The first step, which starts today, is the study phase to
determine what and how we want our future aircraft carrier to
be. We have given ourselves 18 months,"" she said.
    Three other Western aircraft carriers have been built since
the Charles de Gaulle was first deployed. The U.S. Navy's Gerald
R. Ford and America, and the British Royal Navy's Queen
Elizabeth, which cost about 3.1 billion pounds ($4.03 billion). 
    
    Parly said the study will assess the size requirements, 
propulsion options - both conventional and nuclear - and
aircraft-launching capabilities.
    A number of French defence firms, ranging from Rafale
warplane maker Dassault <AVMD.PA> to systems' contractor Thales
<TCFP.PA>, are among companies involved in the study phase. 
    The French navy recently completed an 18-month mid-life
upgrade of the Charles de Gaulle. Its most recent activity was
as part of support operations against Islamic State militants in
the Levant region and its battle group is due to return to sea
in the first quarter of 2019.

rescue fund said on Tuesday Greece had no urgent need to issue
new debt for the coming two years but urged a gradual approach
with a possible new issuance when sovereign yields drop from
current levels.
    Greece exited its third bailout in a decade in August. As
part of the financial programme, euro zone lenders gave Greece a
last tranche of loans worth 15 billion euros ($17.19 billion) to
bolster a cash buffer against market pressure for a couple of
years.   
   As a consequence of that deal, ""now there is no urgent need 
for them to go to the markets,"" Klaus Regling, who chairs the
European Stability Mechanism rescue fund, told a news
conference. 
   He said the Greek cash buffer now stood at 22 billion euros,
which meant that ""they don't need to go to the markets for two
years.""
    However, he added that Greece's full return to market
financing should happen gradually with a possible new issuance
before 2020 following two ""quite successful"" auctions last year.
 
    ""The secondary market's yields are higher than they were six
months ago. I would expect when secondary market yields come
down again they (the Greek authorities) will do it,"" Regling
said.
     The head of the rescue fund underlined that it was a
decision that Greece would make on its own while taking into
account national and international developments.
    ""I am confident they will do the right thing,"" he told
reporters.

 (Writes through after RTE report, adds quotes, updates prices)
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Sterling gained half a percent
versus the dollar and euro on Tuesday after a media report that
the European Union could offer British Prime Minister Theresa
May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal.
    The report by Ireland's RTE News followed a Reuters story on
Monday that EU negotiators were looking at ways to promise
Britain a customs deal. [nL8N1X250D]
    EU diplomats have told Reuters that the bloc is examining 
ways to solve the Irish border problem by keeping the whole of
the United Kingdom, and not just Northern Ireland, inside the
EU’s customs territory. 
    This would be fully settled only in post-Brexit negotiations
– and the EU would set stricter terms than May offered. The EU
also still wants some element of special protection for Northern
Ireland in the treaty, although it may be only hypothetical. 
    ""It’s more of the positive news that things are progressing
in terms of the Irish border issue,"" said ING analyst Viraj
Patel, adding that getting May's colleagues to buy into such an
agreement would prove very difficult. ""Until the market sees a
politically viable Brexit deal, sterling is not really going to
hold to short term spikes or gains.""
    The pound rose from below $1.30 <GBP=D3> to as high as
$1.3044 after the RTE report, up 0.6 percent on the day, before
giving up some of the gain. It also jumped versus the euro to as
much as 87.995 pence before easing back to 88.1 pence
<EURGBP=D3>. 
    May's spokesman said on Tuesday that the British leader was
confident she could get a Brexit deal that will win the support
of parliament. [nS8N1TG02E]
    The prime minister had told parliament on Monday that the
Brexit deal with Brussels was 95 percent complete, and she urged
restive lawmakers to back her in the final stages of Britain's
exit from the EU, saying talks were in their most difficult
phase. [nL8N1X21VU]
    But opponents within her own party and in the opposition
have stepped up criticism of the deal she is trying to get, even
if an imminent challenge to May's leadership appears less
likely.
    Analysts said it would remain difficult to find a compromise
between May, her allies and those in her party that wanted a
sharper break from the EU. 
    ""It will be really, really hard to work out a viable
compromise and until that happens, GBP has further to fall,""
said Marshall Glitter, chief strategist at ACLS Global.

    ROME, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission has
rejected Italy's 2019 budget and will ask Rome to present a new
document within three weeks, Italian news agency AGI reported on
Tuesday, citing EU sources.
    The Commission will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m.
(13:30 GMT) to formally announce the decision, AGI said.
    Italy's government of the right-wing League and
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has been locked in a dispute
with Brussels over fiscal issues and presented a budget plan
this month that hikes the deficit to 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product.
    That was sharply up from a targeted 1.8 percent this year,
flouting EU requirements that the deficit should fall steadily
towards a balanced budget.
    Since receiving beefed-up powers in 2013 over member states'
budgetary plans, the Commission has never asked a country to
submit a revised budget.
    The AGI report sent Italian bond yields higher across the
board. (nL8N1X35B6)
    The EU executive warned last week in a letter to Rome that
the budget represented an ""unprecedented"" deviation from Italy's
previous fiscal commitments, while Italian ministers have traded
insults with commissioners.
    In recent days Italy has adopted more moderate tones but 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said there is no reason to
change the deficit target.

    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will face her Conservative Party lawmakers in a private
meeting in parliament on Wednesday, her spokesman said, as she
seeks to calm growing tensions over her Brexit strategy.
    May will make a rare appearance at a meeting of the party's
so-called ""1922 Committee"" of backbenchers in parliament, where
she can expect a rowdy crowd and difficult questions. How she
goes down with restive Conservative lawmakers, some of whom
would like to topple her, will be closely watched.
    With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to
leave the EU, Brexit talks have stalled over a disagreement on
the so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
    May again failed to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week
and her decision to signal the possibility of extending a
post-Brexit transition period, keeping Britain under EU
governance with no say in it, to help end the deadlock has
angered both hardline supporters of Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers.
    Britain's Sunday newspapers were full of anonymous attacks
on her, the violent nature of which have since been condemned by
even her harshest critics. One said May was entering ""the
killing zone"", while another said May should ""bring her own
noose"" to the 1922 committee meeting.
    A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48
Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the
1922 committee to demand such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46
had now been sent, but Reuters could not verify that number.

    Oct 24 (Reuters) - UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit

    By Simon Jessop
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world's largest
asset manager, will keep its biggest European operation and
regional headquarters in Britain after Brexit, moving ""only very
few"" roles to expanded offices in the Netherlands and France, a
memo to staff seen by Reuters showed.
    The commitment by the U.S. firm, which employs around 3,000
staff in Britain and manages around $6.3 trillion worldwide,
means it will still have three times as many staff in Britain as
in all of the remaining 27 European Union countries combined.
    After Brexit, Budapest will become the company's biggest
European Union office, with around 450 staff mainly focusing on
technology and back-office functions.
    The news will be a welcome boost for the City of London and
Prime Minister Theresa May's government as the clock counts down
to the country's March 2019 departure from the EU and talks over
an exit deal between London and Brussels near a conclusion.
    BlackRock had been among the most high-profile financial
services firms yet to confirm its Brexit plans, although more
are expected to announce them in the coming weeks as most
prepare for the worst-case scenario of a breakdown in talks.
    BlackRock said it was making two key changes to the way it
is structured. The first will see its Netherlands office take on
an expanded role to become the main legal entity for much of the
business carried out for EU clients. 
    The second, confirmed in September, will see its Paris
office expand to become a hub for so-called 'alternative'
investments such as real estate and infrastructure. [nFWN1VZ0EW]
    ""We have been preparing for the operational, legal and
strategic impacts of Brexit for several years, and at this
stage, we can tell you that only very few roles will be affected
by our decision to extend the regulatory permissions for
existing entities in Continental Europe,"" the memo said.
    BlackRock confirmed the contents of the memo.
    Total moves out of Britain over the next couple of years
would be minimal, a source familiar with the matter said, with
the Netherlands office adding 10 to 20 people through moves and
local hires, mostly in risk and legal.
    The Paris office, which currently houses 40 staff, mostly in
sales, would double to around 80 people over that time, but most
of those staff would be hired locally, he added.
    However, BlackRock appeared to leave the door open to
further staff moves depending on how the talks and post-Brexit
regulatory regimes change.
    ""As there is still much political and regulatory uncertainty
on the horizon, we remain flexible and continue to monitor all
developments very closely. We will keep you posted of further
developments,"" the memo said.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - In the end it was Theresa May who
asked to address her restive Conservative Party lawmakers at a
private meeting today rather than being ""summoned"" to hear their
complaints about her Brexit handling. That would suggest the
meeting is likely to be less awkward for her than first imagined
- even possibly allowing her to argue afterwards there was an
expression of loyalty towards her. The encounter comes amid
local media leaks of government planning for some of the most
extreme Brexit outcomes. On the one hand, The Times cites
documents drawn up by her chief Europe adviser which speak of a
""long-running implementation period"" (i.e transition phase) that
could be rolled over on an annual basis if needed - effectively
leaving the UK in an open-ended Norway-style relationship with
the EU. At the other extreme, the FT reports that plans were
discussed at a stormy cabinet meeting for Britain to charter
ships to ferry in critical food and medicines in the event of a
""no-deal"" Brexit.
    NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will be pushed at a
briefing this morning to respond to Donald Trump's plans to
withdraw from a 1987 treaty limiting arms in Europe. The move,
which came largely out of the blue but was confirmed by his
adviser John Bolton in Moscow last night, has created much
anxiety within NATO. Some in the alliance see it as the latest
example of the split between the Trump White House and the rest
of the US administration. More widely it is evidence of Trump
abandoning a core piece of NATO policy in a unilateral fashion.
Germany has said it will fight the proposal using all diplomatic
channels possible: the battle starts when Washington's NATO
ambassador presents the plan to fellow alliance envoys in
Brussels on Thursday.
    European capitals will be closely watching Italian PM
Giuseppe Conte's talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. Rome
is a firm critic of existing EU sanctions on Russia put in place

    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    A late rally for Wall St stock indices on Tuesday has helped
take the edge off an increasingly anxious mood on world markets
but the S&P still ended down for the 5th straight day, losing
more than half a percent. Although the rally from five-month
lows eased some nerves, the index failed to recapture its
200-day moving average and remains on course for its worst month
since at least August 2015. Peak-to-trough losses in October
were as much as 8.5 percent at one point yesterday. Earnings
season angst and worries about deteriorating corporate guidance
despite decent third quarter bottom lines has been one of main
drivers of the selloff this week, with markets wary of outlooks
from big industrial stocks such as Halliburton and Caterpillar
and fearful that rising trade tensions between the United States
and China will start to hit the big tech firms too. Caterpillar
stock dropped almost 8 percent on Tuesday after just failing to
lift its full-year 2018 steer for the first time in three
quarters. Microsoft will be the mostly closely watched update
later on Wednesday after the market closes. Global markets were
steadier overnight, with Chinese and Japanese equity benchmarks
eking out small gains and the MSCI all-country index flat for
the day so far, but at risk of recording its 6th straight daily
loss after hitting its lowest in more than year on Tuesday.
    European stocks futures opened up about half a percent amid
a deluge of earnings on this side of the pond and with the banks
in focus. But S&P futures were still in the red overnight and
10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped to 3.14 percent, with the
2-10-year yield curve flattening to its lowest in about three
weeks. Apart from earnings jitters, more general fears of ebbing
world growth amid escalating trade wars and
economically-sensitive political tensions from Saudi Arabia to
Italy and Brexit are enough to keep investors worried. Global
flash manufacturing business surveys for October out through the
day will be another key sounding on confidence. French
industrial confidence fell to its lowest reading in almost two
years this month, early PMI readings showed. A combination of
global demand concerns and Saudi commitments to keep supplies
buoyed enough to offset the loss of embargoed Iranian crude has
dragged Brent crude oil prices to its lowest in a month this
week but it hovered just above $76 per barrel first thing. 
    In currency markets, the safe-haven yen gave up much of
Tuesday’s gains against the dollar and the greenback was a touch
firmer more broadly. Sterling was off a fraction as markets eye
UK PM May’s meeting with backbenchers from her own ruling
Conservative party later today amid concerns about a leadership
challenge. Italian 10-year government bond yields were steady
below the week’s highs, with markets eyeing the next steps after
the European Commission on Tuesday asked Italy to resubmit its
draft budget with lower deficit targets.  Deputy PM Salvini
insisted again early on Wednesday that there would be no
changes, but also stressed Italy did not want to leave the euro
or European Union.
    In European corporate news, it’s a big days for banking
shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe.
Deutsche Bank stock lost almost 3 percent after announced a
steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track
to swing to a profit this year. Nordea also had a weak quarter
and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity.
Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned to cut at least 1,600
jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter
operating profit slightly above market expectations. In the UK,
Barclays  reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as
its under-pressure investment banking division booked increased
trading revenues despite difficult market conditions. Still in
financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose.

    By Stefano Bernabei
    ROME, Oct 24 (Reuters) - European lawmakers have
short-listed Italy's Andrea Enria and Ireland's Sharon Donnery
to be the next head of the EU's banking supervisory body, two
sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.
    Enria is chairman of the European Banking Authority while
Donnery is the Irish deputy central bank chief.
    The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs
Committee held a closed-door hearing in Strasbourg on Tuesday to
assess three candidates who had put themselves forward to take
charge of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). 
    They subsequently passed on the names of Enria and Donnery
to the European Central Bank, which takes the decision, the
sources said. French financial markets regulator Robert Ophele
was the third candidate, sources told Reuters last month.
    The 25-member governing council of the ECB is expected to
hold a secret ballot on the nomination at a Nov. 7 meeting.
    Enria was not backed by the Italian ruling League party's
representative within the European Parliament, the sources said.
    ""The League was very critical about Enria's position against
banking rules for easing credit criteria to small and
medium-sized businesses,"" one of the sources said, asking not to
be identified since the procedure is not public.
    According to the second source, EU lawmakers underlined
Enria's international experience in its letter to ECB President
Mario Draghi. They said Donnery would offer a better gender
balance among top EU jobs.
    Donnery has been seen for weeks as the favourite as she is
expected to enjoy German support after taking a no-nonsense
stance toward banks for hoarding massive piles of non-performing
loans, other sources said earlier.
    But Enria is also seen as a strong candidate for being tough
on bad loans, a major problem for banks in his native Italy, as
well as for banks in Greece, Portugal and Cyprus, two other
sources said this week.
    The current head of the SSM, France's Daniele Nouy, is due
to step down when her term expires at the end of the year.
    An ECB spokesman declined to comment.
    The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs
Committee and the European Council must also approve the ECB's
choice of new SSM chief.

    * Fresh setbacks could further weaken her national coalition
    * Greens aim for role as Germany's dominant centrist party
    * Three-way coalitions likely to become new norm in Germany

    By Paul Carrel and Douglas Busvine
    BERLIN/OFFENBACH, Germany, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Branding
themselves as the party of reason, Germany's Greens are budding
kingmakers in an election in the state of Hesse on Sunday that
promises the second thumping in as many weeks for conservative
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her ruling allies.
    The environmentalist Greens are building on momentum that
saw them come second in a state election in Bavaria on Oct. 14.
They are carving out a role as Germany's dominant centrist
party, which promises to shake up national coalition politics.
    Born in 1980 out of the ecologist movement of the late 1960s
and 1970s, the Greens are now very much part of Germany's
establishment, drawing voters fed up with infighting in Merkel's
awkward left-right coalition, mainly over curbing immigration.
    ""We are the only party that hasn't been driven crazy by
right-wing populism,"" Tarek Al-Wazir, the Greens' half-Yemeni
leader in Hesse, told 200 voters during a question-and-answer
session on Monday in Offenbach, just outside Frankfurt.
    Like Al-Wazir, Hesse evokes diversity: almost a third of its
6.2 million population is of a migrant background. It was also
the first state where the Greens entered government, teaming up
under Joschka Fischer with the Social Democrats in 1985.
    Sunday's election in Hesse, which includes the financial and
banking hub Frankfurt, may produce another first for the Greens.
    So popular is 47-year-old Al-Wazir - voters prefer him to
all other party leaders in Hesse - that there is a slim chance
of him becoming state premier after running a campaign focused
on pragmatism and his record as the state's economy minister.
    ""We believe it's important to talk about common sense in the
time of Trump,"" he said at Monday evening's two-hour session, at
which he switched easily between touting his policy achievements
and fielding questions on national and international issues.
    His pragmatic pitch is resonating. In Hesse, opinion polls
show the Greens are competing for second place with the
centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Merkel's conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) still lead, but with reduced support.
    Nationally, the Greens are polling in second place.
    ""The realignment of the German party system is in full
swing, and the Greens are in pole position to take over the role
as the new, truly centrist force,"" said Carsten Nickel, managing
director at Teneo Intelligence, a consultancy.
    
    NEW NORM
    Polls suggest the incumbent CDU/Greens government in Hesse -
a political match-up that itself was unheard of until recently -
may lack sufficient support to remain in power, opening up 
other potential coalition options involving the Greens.
    The CDU and Greens could team up with the business-friendly
Free Democrats (FDP); the Greens, SPD and FDP could, in theory,
join forces - though the FDP is not keen; or the Greens and SPD
could work with the far-left Linke.
    Under the latter two options, Al-Wazir could be premier. He
is not committing to any coalition until after the vote.
    ""Three-way coalitions will become the norm in Germany,"" said
Jan Techau at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a
think-tank.
    In Hesse, the Greens and SPD are tied on 21 percent support,
behind the CDU on 26 percent, a survey by pollster INSA for Bild
newspaper showed on Tuesday. The far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) was on 13 percent.
    Another poll last week put the Greens just ahead of the SPD.
    The polling reflects growing disenchantment with Merkel's
conservatives and the SPD - allies in her national government.
At the last Hesse election, in 2013, the CDU won 38.3 percent of
the vote, the SPD 30.7 percent and the Greens just 11.1 percent.
    A poor outcome for Merkel's CDU in Hesse, after her Bavarian
CSU allies suffered their worst result since 1950 two weeks ago,
would turbo-charge a debate about who succeeds her and when. She
has been chancellor for 13 years.
    ""So far, no obvious challenger has emerged, which is the
main reason why she is still in power,"" said Techau.
    But a poor CDU performance in Hesse would embolden Merkel's
enemies before her party's annual congress in December, when she
will seek re-election as chairwoman. Trying to shore up CDU
support, she is making four campaign stops in Hesse this week.
    Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already
come close to collapsing twice, and a weak SPD performance in
Hesse could reignite a debate in the party about whether it
should pull out of the coalition.
    ""The one thing that ties the SPD to Merkel is its fear of
virtual extinction in new (national) elections,"" said Nickel.
    The conservative CDU/CSU allies only formed their loveless
national alliance with the SPD in March after talks on a
three-way coalition of the conservatives, Greens and FDP
collapsed. Merkel has ruled three times with the SPD and once
with the FDP.
    Now the Greens are looking to the Hesse vote to make
themselves indispensable to any government. ""We want to make
sure that nobody can manage without us,"" said Al-Wazir.

    Hundreds of people died in the overnight putsch attempt,
which was followed by a vast security crackdown involving
thousands of arrests of alleged followers of exiled cleric
Fethullah Gulen, some of whom are German-Turkish dual citizens.
    Erdogan's government has accused the U.S.-based Gulen of
orchestrating the coup, something he has repeatedly denied.
    ""Arrests and prosecutions frequently related to social media
posts that were critical of the government,"" read the new travel
advice. ""In some cases merely 'liking' another's post of that
nature is enough,"" it adds.
    With Germany home to 3 million people of Turkish background,
relations been the two countries have always been complicated,
but they hit rock bottom in the wake of the post-coup round-up.
    A flurry of diplomatic activity, including a state visit by
Erdogan to Germany, has so far yielded little in the way of
reduced tensions, with Berlin deeply concerned at Ankara's
influence over Germany's Turkish community.
    The ministry added that even private comments could be
risky. ""Non-public comments on social media can be forwarded to
Turkish authorities via denunciations,"" it said. ""A conviction
for 'insulting the president' or 'spreading terrorist
propaganda' can lead to many years' imprisonment.""
    Social media have become the primary platform for political
opposition in Turkey, where traditional media are saturated with
positive coverage of Erdogan and his ministers.
    Turkish authorities have detained people who criticised a
military operation in Syria on social media and those who posted
comments about the economy ""in a provocative way"", as the lira
tumbled against the dollar this year. [nL8N1PJ1N5] [nI7N1V401M]
    Germany is has a large and growing community of exiled 
critics of Erdogan, many of whom Ankara wants to see extradited
on terrorism charges. Some complain they are subject to
surveillance by Turkey's intelligence services.

previous forecast.
    The Foundation of Economic and Industrial Research
(IOBE)said increased export activity was the main driver,
expecting  consumer spending to pick up in the second half on
improved expectations.
    IOBE sees the 180 billion-euro economy expanding by about
2.4 percent in 2019, helped by a projected 12 to 14 percent rise
in investments and a projected 1.4 percent increase in private
consumption.
    Stronger domestic demand will be manifested in imports which
are seen rising by 6 to 6.5 percent.
    Greece, which emerged from its last bailout programme in
August, has been growing for six straight quarters after
expanding 1.5 percent in 2017. [nL8N1VP1VF] 
    ""An eight-year cycle during which the economy went through
three successive support programmes was completed in August. The
significant balancing of the economy that was achieved should
not be underestimated,"" said IOBE Chief Nikos Vettas.
    Without the security of bailout programmes and access to
capital markets not yet attained, it was of central importance
when access will be achieved and on what terms, given that the
economy's financing is currently anaemic, he said.
    ""The existence of a safety cushion should not lead to
complacency. The more the period of non-normal financing is
prolonged, the chances that normal funding will take place with
discomfort increase.""

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Private equity firm HarbourVest
said on Wednesday it will open a Dublin office to help minimise
any disruption to its clients and funds from Britain leaving the
European Union (EU) next year.
    HarbourVest, which has $50 billion in assets under
management and more than 400 employees, is not planning to
reduce the size of its London office but will have fund managers
in Dublin, its managing director John Toomey said.
    Many firms without regulated EU operations outside Britain
are working on the assumption of a ""hard Brexit"", where they
will no longer be able to sell their services across the EU
without an operation regulated by an EU member country.
    Disagreement over what to do about the Irish border after
Britain leaves the EU has stalled a Brexit deal in recent weeks.
 
    Some investment management firms with a base in Britain are
opening offices on the continent as part of plans to ensure they
can sell to EU clients after Britain exits the bloc.
    HarbourVest said it will open the Dublin office once it has
Irish AIFM (Alternative Investment Fund Managers) authorisation.
    Blackstone <BX.N> is among a number of financial services
companies to have chosen Luxembourg as the site for a European
Union subsidiary while several hedge funds, including Winton,
have opted for Dublin.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

    By Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - An uncompromising challenge to
EU budget rules by Italy is providing the first big test for
reforms introduced to save the euro zone nine years ago as
financial crisis threatened to tear it apart.
    The reforms remain a work in progress, and in urgent need of
fuller implementation before the bloc's next crisis strikes.
    But the defiance from Rome that has locked it into an
unprecedented standoff with Brussels - and given fresh legs to a
discredited image of financially responsible northern euro zone
nations pitted against a profligate south - seems certain to
delay that process and probably dilute it for good.
    In May 2010, the then 16 countries sharing the euro clubbed
together to create a rescue fund whose first task was to save
Greece from going bust.
    The ensuing bailout programme, only concluded in August when
the country exited its third rescue package, produced a
consensus that closer economic cooperation was needed to better
protect the system against future shocks.
    With that in mind, euro zone states are now moving towards
giving their bailout fund new powers of economic monitoring.
    They also aim to strengthen a second fund designed to
protect the banking system, extend national guarantee schemes
for bank deposits across the whole currency bloc and introduce a
euro zone budget.
    Germany and its neighbours insist that, before they take on
more bloc-wide financial commitments, financial risks within it
must be substantially reduced.
    But as a populist government in debt-laden Italy lays out
plans to spend more borrowed money in clear contravention of EU
rules, the deposit scheme and euro zone budget are becoming a
more distant prospects.
    ""It is going to be more difficult now. When you talk about
deposit insurance, the appetite is smaller. Italy is an
additional argument not to even think about it,"" one senior euro
zone official said.
    The EU is due to present the next phase of the integration
package in December - and officials expect it to underwhelm.
    ""We are still heading for some minimalist package of
reforms. We are going to get some ESM (bailout fund)
strengthening, we are going to get the backstop to the Bank
Resolution Fund and not a lot more,"" a second senior official
said.
    ""The idea of a euro zone fiscal capacity does not seem to
have a lot of viability, I am sceptical whether it will
translate into something in reality,"" the second official said.
    
    DISCIPLINE BY MARKETS
    Italy's refusal to keep in check its bloated public finances
also ruins the positive impression that southern countries -
notably the bloc's third sovereign bailout recipient Portugal -
made with reforms that helped counter the German focus on more
fiscal discipline.
    And it might bring back discussions, championed by Berlin,
about setting up a debt restructuring mechanism for countries
that lose market access - a fate that could theoretically befall
Italy if investors begin to doubt its ability to repay a debt
pile equivalent to 133 percent of GDP.
    ""My fear is that because of the situation in Italy, Germany
can say that market discipline is a good thing because the (EU)
Commission cannot enforce the rules,"" a third official said.
    ""Maybe this can also start to convince France, if we have
countries that deliberately break the rules and don't really
care about the Stability and Growth Pact (on fiscal discipline)
any more,"" he said.
    But while officials agree that ultimately only the markets
hold the power to force Italy to change its fiscal policy - a
view shared by the government in Rome - leaving it only to
investors to exert pressure could be dangerous.
    ""The markets will discipline irresponsible behaviour, but
they do it very late and they do it in a very extreme way,"" the
second official said.
    The Pact requires governments to cut their structural
deficits, which exclude one-offs and business cycle swings,
every year until the books are balanced. Public debt must be cut
every year too.
    If they don't, the Commission can start disciplinary steps
that can end in fines -- a prospect Rome now faces if it ignores
the Commission's demand to change the 2019 budget so that the
structural gap falls rather than rises. 
    Italy has no supporters among other euro zone governments.
    But with the challenge to Brussels having enhanced the
popularity of ruling coalition heads Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di
Maio among domestic voters, it is still unlikely to yield.
    Unless markets force them to, they certainly have no
incentive to back down before European Parliament elections in
May, officials believe.
    This makes the current clash far more dangerous for Brussels
and supporters of closer economic integration than previous
spats over fiscal policy with France, Spain or Portugal, or
indeed previous Italian administrations, a fourth official said.
    ""In the past, we had to deal with governments breaking EU
rules but at least willing to cooperate. In the case of Italy,
we have an uncooperative government,"" the official said.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    The European Commission had no comment.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

    By Kate Holton
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Transport company
boss Chris Blackburn is contemplating spending almost a million
pounds for a chance to keep his trucks on European roads if
Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March.
    Upgrading the emissions standards of his fleet would allow
him to compete for the 984 annual European travel permits
allocated for British trucks next year.
    Competition will be fierce. Some 38,000 British trucks
routinely drive in the EU and, if there is no Brexit deal, they
will only be able to carry on with a permit. Britain's EU
membership meant they have never needed one before. 
     Even if Blackburn funds the upgrade, there is no guarantee
the government will consider his business, moving industrial and
construction equipment, important enough to give him permits.
    Losing access would put a major strain on his 93-year-old
family firm, Chambers & Cook, which has annual revenue of around
20 million pounds.
    With barely five months to go, Britain has yet to agree exit
terms and companies do not know how they will trade with the
world's largest trading bloc.
     Blackburn's predicament highlights the uncertainty of an
industry which moves around 420 billion pounds ($547 billion) of
goods between Britain and Europe each year to support
manufacturers, retailers and even musicians.    
    ""No or too few permits would be catastrophic,"" the
53-year-old said at his Birmingham base, overlooking the M6
motorway.
    ""It is a gamble. It's a massive cost."" 
    Many businesses are preparing for the worst, a no-deal where
newly installed customs checks delay the movement of goods,
leading to tailbacks and shattering cross-border supply chains. 
    For the haulage and freight industry that means applying for
permits and international driving licences, increasing warehouse
space in Britain and Europe, ramping up customs capabilities and
looking into European vehicle registration. 
    They are also trialling different ports in case Dover,
Britain's main gateway to Europe, becomes gridlocked, delaying
the daily movement of up to 16,000 trucks. 
    Under government plans, two motorways and an airport in the
south of England will be used as car parks if needed. 
    ""Every hour that a vehicle is standing costs 50 pounds
because they're not earning,"" Richard Burnett, chief executive
of the Road Haulage Association told Reuters. ""Within weeks we
would see haulage companies go out of business.""
    The government says it is confident of securing a deal but
that the industry should prepare to use permits. It will also
seek new bilateral agreements as quickly as possible if needed. 
  
    
    JUGGLING RESOURCES
    For Blackburn, the priority is to get his company into shape
to win as many permits as possible, so he can then juggle his
resources by, for instance, allowing a driver set for Europe to
pick up a permit from one returning to the UK. 
   The annual ECMT permits are issued by the International
Transport Forum each year for travel in 43 countries including
Russia, Turkey, Albania and Armenia and EU member states. 
    The annual permits, only for trucks meeting Euro 6 emissions
standards, have rarely been used by British trucks as they
typically only travel in the EU. Britain will allocate them to
hauliers based on goods and travel frequency.
    Chambers & Cook sends up to 20 trucks into Europe a day,
mostly through Dover but it also has operations in the north
east port of Immingham.
    While the vast majority of goods go via Dover's fast
roll-on, roll-off ships, Immingham and other ports offer
unaccompanied trade, where loaded trailers are picked up around
the country, dropped at the port and left to be loaded onto
European-bound vessels. 
    The service is slower and limited in its capacity however,
but the fact that hauliers used to fast trade are considering
such options show the level of concern. 
    James Colson, overseeing Brexit planning for Yusen Logistics
and its 2,000 UK staff, could use Portsmouth and Poole on the
south coast for France and the Iberian peninsula, or Harwich,
Hull, and Newcastle for northern Europe and Scandinavia.
    ""They're already pretty full, hence why we're starting now,""
he said, of their early trials. 
    Colson hopes to get permits as Yusen moves goods for
mainstream sectors including automotive, aerospace,
pharmaceuticals, and retail.
    
    ALARM
    Businesses operating in more niche areas are worried that
they will not be considered important enough for the permits. 
    Transam Trucking's fleet of black trucks are built for
moving the stages, screens and sound equipment used by the likes
of U2, Elton John and Iron Maiden.
    ""People are looking for tours next summer and customers are
asking questions,"" Transam's Natasha Highcroft told Reuters.  
     Only 60 of Transam's 150 trucks are Euro 6 emissions
standard so this would also limit permit use. The value of the
goods they move, and the tight timeframes required, mean they
could not do unaccompanied shipping.    
    David Rogers and his family-owned EM Rogers moves cars all
over Europe for testing. He hopes they would be a priority due
to Britain's leading role in the global automotive chain, but
nothing is clear. ""It's frightening,"" he said. ""There aren't
many people who can do what we're doing"".
    Rogers has a business in the Netherlands and could increase
the number of lorries registered there, but that is not an
option available to many. 
    The alarm comes at a difficult time for the industry, with
many British firms saying they have struggled to compete against
European companies with cheaper labour and diesel. 
    Supporters of leaving the EU have always acknowledged it
could cause short term disruption but say ultimately Britain
will be freed of red tape and able to trade more widely. A
survey of truck drivers taken before the 2016 referendum showed
a majority backed Brexit.
    Blackburn, talking next to photographs showing Chambers &
Cook trucks from the 1960s and 1970s, said he could not
understand why politicians were taking so long to agree a deal.
    ""They've had a lot of time and haven't achieved anything,""
he said. ""As it's looking like there's a significant chance of
no deal, our current plan is to assume that happens.""

    By Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - An uncompromising challenge to
EU budget rules by Italy is providing the first big test for
reforms introduced to save the euro zone nine years ago as
financial crisis threatened to tear it apart.
    The reforms remain a work in progress, and in urgent need of
fuller implementation before the bloc's next crisis strikes.
    But the defiance from Rome that has locked it into an
unprecedented standoff with Brussels - and given fresh legs to a
discredited image of financially responsible northern euro zone
nations pitted against a profligate south - seems certain to
delay that process and probably dilute it for good.
    In May 2010, the then 16 countries sharing the euro clubbed
together to create a rescue fund whose first task was to save
Greece from going bust.
    The ensuing bailout programme, only concluded in August when
the country exited its third rescue package, produced a
consensus that closer economic cooperation was needed to better
protect the system against future shocks.
    With that in mind, euro zone states are now moving towards
giving their bailout fund new powers of economic monitoring.
    They also aim to strengthen a second fund designed to
protect the banking system, extend national guarantee schemes
for bank deposits across the whole currency bloc and introduce a
euro zone budget.
    Germany and its neighbours insist that, before they take on
more bloc-wide financial commitments, financial risks within it
must be substantially reduced.
    But as a populist government in debt-laden Italy lays out
plans to spend more borrowed money in clear contravention of EU
rules, the deposit scheme and euro zone budget are becoming a
more distant prospects.
    ""It is going to be more difficult now. When you talk about
deposit insurance, the appetite is smaller. Italy is an
additional argument not to even think about it,"" one senior euro
zone official said.
    The EU is due to present the next phase of the integration
package in December - and officials expect it to underwhelm.
    ""We are still heading for some minimalist package of
reforms. We are going to get some ESM (bailout fund)
strengthening, we are going to get the backstop to the Bank
Resolution Fund and not a lot more,"" a second senior official
said.
    ""The idea of a euro zone fiscal capacity does not seem to
have a lot of viability, I am sceptical whether it will
translate into something in reality,"" the second official said.
    
    DISCIPLINE BY MARKETS
    Italy's refusal to keep in check its bloated public finances
also ruins the positive impression that southern countries -
notably the bloc's third sovereign bailout recipient Portugal -
made with reforms that helped counter the German focus on more
fiscal discipline.
    And it might bring back discussions, championed by Berlin,
about setting up a debt restructuring mechanism for countries
that lose market access - a fate that could theoretically befall
Italy if investors begin to doubt its ability to repay a debt
pile equivalent to 133 percent of GDP.
    ""My fear is that because of the situation in Italy, Germany
can say that market discipline is a good thing because the (EU)
Commission cannot enforce the rules,"" a third official said.
    ""Maybe this can also start to convince France, if we have
countries that deliberately break the rules and don't really
care about the Stability and Growth Pact (on fiscal discipline)
any more,"" he said.
    But while officials agree that ultimately only the markets
hold the power to force Italy to change its fiscal policy - a
view shared by the government in Rome - leaving it only to
investors to exert pressure could be dangerous.
    ""The markets will discipline irresponsible behaviour, but
they do it very late and they do it in a very extreme way,"" the
second official said.
    The Pact requires governments to cut their structural
deficits, which exclude one-offs and business cycle swings,
every year until the books are balanced. Public debt must be cut
every year too.
    If they don't, the Commission can start disciplinary steps
that can end in fines -- a prospect Rome now faces if it ignores
the Commission's demand to change the 2019 budget so that the
structural gap falls rather than rises. 
    Italy has no supporters among other euro zone governments.
    But with the challenge to Brussels having enhanced the
popularity of ruling coalition heads Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di
Maio among domestic voters, it is still unlikely to yield.
    Unless markets force them to, they certainly have no
incentive to back down before European Parliament elections in
May, officials believe.
    This makes the current clash far more dangerous for Brussels
and supporters of closer economic integration than previous
spats over fiscal policy with France, Spain or Portugal, or
indeed previous Italian administrations, a fourth official said.
    ""In the past, we had to deal with governments breaking EU
rules but at least willing to cooperate. In the case of Italy,
we have an uncooperative government,"" the official said.

closely tracked by the ECB — has slipped to 1.6689 percent

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> has
announced plans to intensify competition with rival London Stock
Exchange <LSE.L> ahead of Brexit, saying it would expand a
profit-sharing scheme.
    The Frankfurt-based exchange's Eurex Clearing said it will
expand its ""partnership"" programme to include repurchase or repo
agreements and foreign exchange traded among banks from the
first quarter of 2019.
    The more volume that users pass through Eurex, the bigger
share of profit they will get. It is similar to a long-standing
programme at the LSE's LCH unit, which dominates
euro-denominated clearing in Europe. [nL8N1MK137]
    Financial centres such as Frankfurt and Paris are vying to
win a share of London's financial market, Europe's biggest, as
UK-based financial firms shift some business to new EU hubs
ahead of Brexit.
    The aim of the repo programme is to increase choice and
efficiency for market participants in special repo and general
collateral instruments, and to grow in the dealer-to-client repo
business, Eurex said.
    LCH's Paris subsidiary clears repo-related business.
    Some EU policymakers want euro-denominated clearing moved
from London to the euro zone after Brexit.
    In the event of a no-deal Brexit, London would likely remain
a clearing centre for EU customers to give rivals like Eurex
time to build up capacity, an EU document indicated on
Wednesday. [nL8N1X5247]
    Eurex launched its programme a year ago to capture a chunk
of LCH's euro interest rate swaps business, though it is still
dwarfed by its London counterpart.
    The OTC FX market is still largely uncleared, Eurex said.
    ""Eurex Clearing is currently working with market
participants to be the first major clearinghouse to offer a
comprehensive cross-currency swap clearing service,"" it said in
a statement.
    Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley
have expressed an early interest to join both new segments,
Eurex said, adding that Citigroup, DekaBank and LBBW may
participate in the repo programme.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen and Swiss franc
gained only briefly on Thursday as currency traders showed
little reaction to a wave of selling across stock markets,
although China's offshore yuan hit a 22-month low on worries
about an economic slowdown.
    The euro recovered from Wednesday's two-month lows, before
the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting.
    Despite the downturn by stocks, worries about corporate
earnings growth and doubts about the global economy, forex
investors only tiptoed into the yen and Swiss franc, two
currencies historically bought during downturns [nL2N1X41ON].
    ""To a large extent, until today there had been a lack of
reaction in the FX markets. We are starting to see this come
through,"" said Christin Tuxen, FX strategist at Danske Bank.
    Relatively small currency swings reflected how recent data
had showed a ""loss of momentum in global growth"", Tuxen said,
rather than a risk of recession or something serious enough to
spook investors.
    The yen rose as high as 111.82 <JPY=> versus the dollar,
then retreated in European trading to settle at 112.275, flat on
the day.
    The Swiss franc gave up all its gains versus the dollar to
trade at 0.9982 <CHF=> and was down 0.2 percent against the euro
<EURCHF=>.
    The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1417 <EUR=>, up from its
two-month lows of $1.1378. The dollar index <.DXY> was off 0.1
percent at 96.333.
    The Australian dollar, often viewed as a bellwether for
global risk, rose 0.2 percent to $0.7074 <AUD=>. 
    However, in a sign that the worries about global growth and
particularly in China are beginning to bite, the offshore yuan
<CNH=> hit its weakest since the start of January 2017, down 0.3
percent on the day at 6.9668.
    
    ECB IN FOCUS
    Investors will be looking for any new guidance from the ECB
at its meeting later on Thursday on a possible slowdown in
growth, as well as the row between Brussels and Rome over
Italy's budget plans. [nL9N1T2012]
    The ECB is not expected to offer any surprises. Instead, it
will confirm that quantitative easing is on track to end next
year.
    Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note that after recent
falls in the single currency, euro/dollar may face a short
squeeze if the ECB was surprisingly bullish.
    ""The global economy is continuing to face higher inflation
and tightening capacity, suggesting that central banks may need
to continue tightening even in the face of rising market
volatility,"" they said.

 (Writes through after ECB rate decision)
    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro was steady on Thursday
after the European Central Bank stuck to its plans for ending
bond purchases by the end of the year and as traders prepared
for President Mario Draghi's press conference.
    Investors will be looking for any new guidance from Draghi
on recent signs of a possible slowdown in euro zone growth, as
well as the row between Brussels and Rome over Italy's budget
plans. [nL8N1X522B] [nL9N1T2012]
    The ECB kept rates on hold and remains on course to claw
back unprecedented monetary stimulus even as the growth outlook
darkens.
    Morgan Stanley analysts said that after recent falls in the
single currency, euro/dollar may face a short squeeze if the ECB
and Draghi strike a surprisingly bullish tone.
    ""The global economy is continuing to face higher inflation
and tightening capacity, suggesting that central banks may need
to continue tightening even in the face of rising market
volatility,"" they said in a note. 
    The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1409 <EUR=>, recovering
from two-month lows of $1.1378 hit on Wednesday. The dollar
index <.DXY> was off 0.1 percent at 96.333.
    Elsewhere, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained only
briefly as currency traders showed little reaction to a wave of
selling across stock markets, although China's offshore yuan hit
a 22-month low on worries about an economic slowdown.
    Despite the downturn in stocks, amid worries about corporate
earnings growth and doubts about the global economy, forex
investors only tiptoed into the yen and Swiss franc, two
currencies typically seen as safe havens during downturns.

itself back and erased most losses.

ECB's statement issued after its policy meeting on Thursday: 
    
    Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we
decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We
continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at
least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as
necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
    Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will
continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of 15 billion euros
until the end of December 2018. We anticipate that, subject to
incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we
will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an
extended period of time after the end of our net asset
purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain
favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary
accommodation.
    Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected,
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion
of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation
pressures. The underlying strength of the economy continues to
support our confidence that the sustained convergence of
inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even
after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the
same time, uncertainties relating to protectionism,
vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market
volatility remain prominent. Significant monetary policy
stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of
domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments
over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided
by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the
sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated
reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key
ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands
ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure
that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s
inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail,
starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP
increased by 0.4 percent, quarter on quarter, in both the first
and the second quarter of 2018. Incoming information, while
somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with
our baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic
expansion, supported by domestic demand and continued
improvements in the labour market. Some recent sector-specific
developments are having an impact on the near-term growth
profile. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpin
domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing
employment growth and rising wages. At the same time, business
investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable
financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing
investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global
activity is expected to continue supporting euro area exports,
though at a slower pace.
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets
and financial market volatility remain prominent.
    Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1 percent in
September 2018, from 2.0 percent in August, reflecting mainly
higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current
futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are
likely to hover around the current level over the coming months.
While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted,
they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost
pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking
ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the
end of the year and to increase further over the medium term,
supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic
expansion and rising wage growth.
    Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth
stood at 3.5 percent in September 2018, after 3.4 percent in
August. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth
is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow
monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad
money growth.
    The growth of loans to the private sector strengthened
further, continuing the upward trend observed since the
beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to
non-financial corporations rose to 4.3 percent in September
2018, from 4.1 percent in August, while the annual growth rate
of loans to households stood at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the
previous month. The euro area bank lending survey for the third
quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be
supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and
favorable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and
loans for house purchase.
    The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in
place since June 2014 continues to significantly support
borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to
financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises
– and credit flows across the euro area.
    To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic
analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis
confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is
still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
    In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy
measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to
raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing
vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in
euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to
increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost
euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal
policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal
buffers. This is particularly important in countries where
government debt is high and for which full adherence to the
Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound
fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent
implementation of the EU’s fiscal and economic governance
framework over time and across countries remains essential to
bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the
functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.
The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to
complete the banking union and the capital markets union.

Italy and the European Commission would resolve their standoff
over Rome's budget plans for 2019.

this week, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending,

    Draghi said the ECB had not examined the issue at length at
its policy-setting meeting that ended on Thursday as it is not a
monetary policy matter. 
    But he quoted European Commission Vice President Valdis
Dombrovskis, who was also at the ECB meeting, as saying: ""We
have to observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking
a dialogue.""
    Draghi said he personally believed the two sides would
resolve the matter.
    ""I'm confident that an agreement will be found,"" he said.
    Borrowing costs for the Italian government have been
hovering near 4-1/2 year highs as investors fear a showdown

    Draghi said that while there may be some spillover to other
bond markets from Italy's problems, any impact was limited.
    Sources have told Reuters Italy would need to secure a
bailout from European institutions, which comes with strict
policy conditions, if it was to receive any help from the ECB.

Fund (IMF) chief Rodrigo Rato arrived at a Madrid prison on
Thursday to start a four-and-a-half year jail term for using
company credit cards to make costly personal purchases while
running state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>.
    Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent
figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the
IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state
bailout in 2012.
    Spain's High Court ruled in 2017 that Rato was responsible
for overseeing the misuse of credit cards at the bank, which
involved 64 former Bankia executives, including Rato.
    Corporate credit cards were used to buy jewels, holidays and
expensive clothes, as well as more mundane everyday personal
purchases. In total, prosecutors investigated some 12 million
euros in spending between 2003 and 2012.
    Carrying two suitcases and dressed in jeans, a grey shirt
and a blue sleeveless jacket, Rato thanked family and friends
for their support during the legal process against him before
entering the Soto del Real prison on the outskirts of Madrid.
     ""First of all I would like to say that I fully accept my
obligations before society, I recognise all the mistakes that I 
may have made and I ask for forgiveness from those who may have
felt deceived,"" Rato told reporters gathered outside the jail.
    He appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing, arguing
the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were legal.
    But Spain's Supreme Court confirmed earlier this month the
four-and-half year jail sentence from the High Court and said it
considered the sentence to be proportionate due to Rato's
preeminent position at Bankia.
    The so-called ""black cards"" case sparked widespread anger
when the scandal first broke in 2014, at a time when Spain was
recovering from years of recession, mass layoffs and a banking
crisis partly triggered by Bankia's massive bailout.
    Rato still faces two other legal cases, one over Bankia's
ill-fated public listing in 2011 -- with the trial expected to
begin at the end of November -- and another for tax fraud.

482,1752,2296,5612,57c4fb615f536dfd8b44cd3893296dff,UPDATE 1-Germany's tax revenues seen growing at slower pace,2018-10-25 23:12:24,EUR,0.0,2018-10-25 23:12:33,{'EUR': 'Positive'}," (Adds Scholz)
    BERLIN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - German tax revenues should
continue to rise over the next five years, Finance Minister Olaf
Scholz said on Thursday, but he warned that growth in the
revenues would slow, restricting room for manoeuvre in the
budget.
    Tax estimates showed federal government tax revenues would
total 321.3 billion euros ($365.48 billion) this year and rise
to 377 billion euros by 2023, Scholz said as he presented
bi-yearly tax estimates.
    Germany's public sector, which includes the federal
government, regional states, municipalities and social funds,
had a record surplus of more than 38 billion euros last year
after the economy grew 2.2 percent.
    In the first six months of this year alone the public sector
surplus was estimated at just above 48 billion euros, raising
the chance of a record surplus this year too.
    But the government has revised down its economic growth
estimates for this year and each of the next two years to 1.8
percent and Scholz warned that this should be mirrored in a less
rosy tax revenues outlook.
    ""We see a stabilisation of the tax revenues and this means
we must prepare ourselves for a normalisation of tax revenues,""
Scholz told a news conference. ""It remains the case that we
don't want new debt and we want to spend the money of our
citizens responsibly.""
    The figures presented by Scholz showed that tax revenues for
the federal government this year would be 2 billion euros higher
than an estimate in May.
    Scholz said the government was exploring slight increases in
spending on foreign aid, defence and research. He declined to
give details about the scale of the spending increases.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Euro zone prices are expected
to continue growing at 1.7 percent per year until 2020 despite
weaker underlying inflation and economic growth, a European
Central Bank survey showed on Friday.
    The ECB confirmed a day earlier plans to wind down its 2.6
trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) stimulus programme at the end of
this year and raise interest rates sometime after next summer
because it still sees inflation holding up despite uncertainties
around growth.
    Its latest Survey of Professional Forecasters on Friday
backed up that line of thought, with unchanged expectations for
headline inflation for this year and the next two, at 1.7
percent, and in the longer term at 1.9 percent.
    But the forecasters polled by the ECB cut their estimates
for core inflation, which strips out the more volatile energy
and food prices, and economic growth for this year and the next.
    ""Respondents typically attributed their revisions to
external factors such as higher energy prices weighing on
disposable income, with many also noting ... some dampening
impact on exports and investment due to increased uncertainty
surrounding the outlook for world trade,"" the ECB said.
    The euro zone's central bank targets a headline inflation
rate ""below, but close to 2 percent"" over the medium term.
    In its survey, the ECB also noted that growth in core prices
was still accelerating, albeit now 10 basis points more slowly
at 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent the next.
    ""The expected pick-up in underlying inflation remained
underpinned by a pick-up in annual growth in compensation per
employee, which was expected to increase to 2.3 percent by
2020,"" the central bank said.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Concern over China’s slowing
economy dented U.S. stock futures and kept world stocks under
pressure on Monday although European shares climbed thanks to
encouraging earnings reports and relief that Italy dodged a
ratings downgrade.
    The euro, however, fell to a session low after a senior
party source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek
re-election as party chairwoman after bruising losses for her
Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse.
[nS8N1WD01U]
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> was up 0.7 percent by 0929 GMT while
the leading index of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> rose 0.5
percent, boosted by a weaker euro. 
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> led the market with a 1.5 percent
gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low
following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign
rating unchanged, sparking relief there was no ratings
downgrade. [nL8N1X9150]
    This also boosted Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> up 2.7
percent.
    Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting
the farm on a turnaround in risk. 
    ""The only way I can summarize the core sentiment among the
European investors I met is something like 'pretty grim',"" wrote
Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, in a note to
clients.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tracking shares
in 47 countries, managed a 0.1 percent gain. The index is down
9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7 trillion in
market capitalisation since its January peak.
    Overnight losses in Asia were largely led by China’s
blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent.
    Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as
profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth
consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw
materials and manufactured goods. [nL3N1X700R]
    S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial futures declined 0.2 to 0.3
percent after the figures, reversing gains of as much as 0.4
percent earlier. <1YMc1> <ESc1> 
    Global financial markets have been hit by a range of
negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict
to tensions in Europe over Italy's budget and tightening
monetary policy.
    Many indices are already in official correction territory
amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global
growth.
    Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European
earnings at the fastest pace since Feb 2016, and weak results
from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S. stocks at the
end of last week.
    
    BOLSONARO WIN BOOST EMERGING STOCKS
    Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were a bright spot,
gaining 0.1 percent in their first rise in five sessions after
far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the second-round runoff
in Brazil's presidential election.
    Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed as investors cheered
the win. Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust <BRLA.L>
London-listed shares gained 7.4 percent while a Germany-listed
iShares MSCI Brazil ETF <.MBRABRL.DE> climbed 6.6 percent.
    ""Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is
that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing
the country's competitiveness,"" said UBS analysts. 
    In FX, the dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.2 percent to 96.553
after gaining 0.7 percent last week.
    The euro <EUR=> fell 0.2 percent to near a two-month low at
$1.1381. Sterling <GBP=> fell 0.2 percent, holding near a
two-month trough of $1.2775 ahead of Britain’s annual budget due
later on Monday. 
    Finance minister Philip Hammond will likely urge his divided
Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push for a
Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity.
    In commodities, oil also reversed early gains to dip on
growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude <CLc1> fell 58
cents to $67.01 per barrel and Brent crude <LCOc1> slid 71 cents
to $76.89.
    Spot gold prices <XAU=> edged lower as the dollar firmed.

    * Prices and climate are part of the appeal 
    * ""Golden visa"" scheme also attracts investors

    By Angeliki Koutantou
    ATHENS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Three times a week, hundreds of
Chinese investors arrive at Athens airport to be greeted by
Greek real estate agents who drive them straight into the city
to view apartments for sale.
    The visitors are drawn to Greece by rock-bottom property
prices and one of Europe's most generous ""golden visa"" schemes,
offering a renewable five-year resident's permit in return for a
250,000 euro ($285,000)investment in real estate.
    That's enough to buy a three-bedroom apartment in the
capital with a view to the Acropolis hill.
    It is also enough to bring the first glimmers of recovery to
the market since the Greek economy started to collapse after the
debt crisis in 2009, although prices are still down by about 40
percent from their peak.
    One Athens resident, who gave his name only as Vassilis, had
almost given up finding a buyer for his home last year when a
minivan pulled up outside his maisonette and a Chinese family of
four got out. A day later, he got an offer.  
    ""They didn’t see the house again. We went and got a
down-payment, and everything was set in motion,"" he said.
    Vassilis had bought the home in the up-and-coming suburb of
Gerakas for 320,000 euros ($367,000) in 2007 and decided to sell
in order to buy his two adult children their own apartments. He
sold it to the Chinese family for 220,000 euros.
    Real estate prices rose 0.8 percent in the second quarter
year-on-year after a 0.1 percent rise in the first – the first
pick-up since 2008, according to Bank of Greece data.
    Foreign direct investment in property jumped 91 percent to
287 million euros last year from 2016, the bank's data showed.
Meanwhile, taxes from property sales rose by an annual 41
percent in the seven months to July to 204.7 million euros,
according to data from state revenue authority AADE. 
    ""We are getting much more phone calls,"" said Lefteris
Potamianos, head of the Real Estate Association of Athens, which
 represents about 3,000 brokers.
    ""The overwhelming majority is foreigners and there are yet
some Greeks. Certainly, Chinese are by far ahead of the game.""
    Potamianos predicted house prices would rise an average 5-7
percent annually in the greater Athens area this year and the
next.

    THE FLIP SIDE
    It helps that the yuan has fallen more than 6 percent
against the dollar this year. Beijing restricts overseas
investment but Chinese investors are still finding ways to get
money out of the country.    
    People like Lian Wenmin, 29, a former accountant from
Beijing and potential golden-visa investor, say buying in Greece
is not just about taking advantage of low prices and getting a
visa that allows them to travel freely within the European
Union.
    Greece's warm climate is also part of the appeal, Lian says.
    ""Greece has very nice weather and I like the people, the
food,"" she told Reuters on the balcony of an apartment she is
thinking of buying in an upmarket area overlooking central
Athens.
    Lian plans to spend 250,000 euros on one or two apartments
in central Athens to rent out on a home-sharing site such as
Airbnb, and possibly on another property for herself in a
southern suburb.
    ""I can buy like two or three apartments with 250,000 but if
I spend the same amount of money in Beijing I can only buy one
apartment in a generally nice location of 30 square meters. It's
big difference,"" she said.
    Tighter restrictions on migration starting last year in the
United States, Canada and Australia - popular destinations for
Chinese in the past - have also worked in Greece's favour, said
Alice Ma, sales manager at Beijing-based Bloom Consulting.
    Portugal's five-year golden-visa programme has also
attracted Chinese interest along with investors from France and
Britain, but there buyers need to put in at least 500,000 euros.
 [nL8N1WC2NZ] [nL8N1WZ4GT]
    Ioannis Anastassiadis's Anastassiadis Group offers a wide
range of services to facilitate Chinese investment, including
providing lawyers and notaries to help secure the visa.
    ""Greece is slowly becoming a place which attracts people to
live here and to plan even the rest of their lives in Greece,""
he said. 
    For renters, the Chinese-led interest is not good news,
however.
    The buy-to-rent mentality of many of the buyers is pushing
up rents and sometimes leading to threats of eviction unless
renters agree to pay the higher prices, said Angelos Skiadas,
head of Greece's tenants association PASYPE.
    Rents across Greece rose by 8.4 percent in the 12 months to
September from a year earlier, according to a survey by the
Greek franchise of RE/MAX International.
    ""Since last year, the problem is becoming a nightmare,""
Skiadas said. ""Τenants are forced to leave because they are
being blackmailed by their landlords, while those who look for a
new house are faced with extravagant rents.""
    He said PASYPE plans to lobby the government to raise the
minimum rental period from three to six years.    
    Of the 3,404 residency permits issued since the golden visa
programme started in 2013, almost 1,700 have gone to Chinese
nationals, data from investment agency Enterprise Greece showed.
    Carrie Law, chief executive of Juwai.com, a Chinese website
for global real estate, said inquiries about Greece doubled in
the first quarter of 2018 and jumped three-fold in the second.
    ""It is a dramatic growth,"" she said.

    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Germany’s
chancellor has called time on her own tenure by deciding to not
seek re-election as chairwoman of her party, the Christian
Democrats. They could shift rightwards after her departure and
adopt a tougher line on those, like Italy, who flout Europe’s
budget rules.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her
Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as
party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior
party source said on Oct. 29.
    - Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up
the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as
chancellor.
    - The Christian Democrats were first in an election held on
Oct. 28 in the western state of Hesse but support for the party
fell by more than 11 points. The centre-left Social Democrats
(SPD), who are Merkel’s junior coalition partner, won about a
fifth of the vote, their worst result in the western state since
1946.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European shares climbed and U.S.
stock futures erased losses on Monday thanks to encouraging
earnings reports, while the euro fell briefly after sources said
German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election as
head of her CDU party.
    Her decision, which followed bruising losses for her
Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse, heralded
the eventual end of an era in which she has dominated European
politics. [nL8N1X926U]
    Senior party sources said Merkel wants to serve her full
term as chancellor until 2021, comment which eased investors'
nerves and subsequently drove the euro back into positive
territory. [nL8N1X92EG]
    Europe's autos sector <.SXAP> surged 4.7 percent, set for
its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China
was considering halving the tax on car purchases in an attempt
to boost demand for autos which has been hurt by a trade war and
slowing economic growth. [nL8N1X92LH] [nL3N1X940G]
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> jumped 2.1 percent by 1128 GMT,
boosted by BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, while the leading index
of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> rose 1.5 percent. 
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> led the market with a 2.8 percent
gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low
following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign
rating unchanged, prompting relief there was no ratings
downgrade. [nL8N1X92J0]
    This also pushed Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> up 4.5
percent, set for their strongest day since Sept. 10.
    Strong gains across Europe helped boost U.S. stock futures
back into the positive, with the Nasdaq futures <NQc1> up 1.4
percent, S&P 500 futures <ESc1> up 1.1 percent and Dow Jones
futures <1YMc1> up 0.7 percent.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tracking shares
in 47 countries, extended early gains to rise 0.4 percent. The
index is down 9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7
trillion in market capitalisation since its January peak.
    Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting
on a turnaround in risk. ""The only way I can summarize the core
sentiment among the European investors I met is something like
'pretty grim',"" wrote Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at
UniCredit, in a note to clients.
    Overnight Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s
blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent.
    Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as
profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth
consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw
materials and manufactured goods. [nL3N1X700R]
    Global financial markets have been hit by a range of
negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict
to tensions in Europe over Italy's budget and tightening
monetary policy.
    Many indices are already in official correction territory
amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global
growth.
    ""With the volatility of the last week or so, today’s
stronger open to markets should not be seen as a sea change but
more a pause for breath,"" said Edward Park, investment director
at Brooks Macdonald. 
    Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European
earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak
results from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S.
stocks at the end of last week.
    
    BOLSONARO WIN BOOSTS EMERGING STOCKS
    Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> climbed 0.4 percent in
their first rise in five sessions after far-right candidate Jair
Bolsonaro won the runoff in Brazil's presidential election.
    Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed as investors cheered
the win. Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust <BRLA.L>
London-listed shares gained 8.4 percent while a Germany-listed
iShares MSCI Brazil ETF <MBRABRL.DE> climbed 5.8 percent.
    ""Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is
that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing
the country's competitiveness,"" said UBS analysts. 
    Foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued with the
dollar index holding flat. 
    The euro <EUR=> recovered after its fall on the Merkel news,
and was last up 0.1 percent at $1.1407. Sterling <GBP=> held
flat and near a two-month trough of $1.2775 before Britain’s
annual budget due later on Monday. 
    Finance minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his
divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push
for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of
austerity.
    In commodities, oil prices dipped as investors priced in
growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude <CLc1> pared
early losses to fall 28 cents to $67.30 per barrel and Brent
crude <LCOc1> slid 29 cents to $77.33.

    NO 'MERKEXIT' RALLY ON THE DAX (1230 GMT)
    News that Merkel will not be seeking re-election as CDU party chairwoman has coincided with
Germany's DAX set for its biggest jump since April. Is that the effect of 'Merkexit' on
investors?
    Likely not. 
    Berenberg's economist Holger Schmieding just told us that the German chancellor's
announcement she will step down after her term ends in 2021 ""adds an extra layer of uncertainty""
to the political future of the euro zone's powerhouse and certainly can't be seen as a positive
right now.
    On the contrary, chances are that decision-making will be put on hold in the short-term and
one can't really see what pro-business policies the departure of ""Mutti"" (Merkel's 'mom'
nickname) could accelerate, if any, he said. 
    Schmieding's analysis is therefore more in line with the euro falling briefly and German
government bond yields edging up.
    As for the DAX, there is little doubt that the surge in European car stocks following
Bloomberg's report on China planning to cut car purchase tax, is the main reason for its rise.
    Volkswagen is up 5.8 percent, Daimler 5 percent and BMW 3.9 percent.

    LATE MORNING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SEES BROAD BOUNCE (1123 GMT)
    The bounce we're seeing in Europe today is pretty broad with all country benchmarks and most
sectoral indexes trading firmly in the black. Relief over S&P's rating decision on Italy
[nL8N1X67LT], some good news from China for the auto sector [nL8N1X92LH] and strong results from
HSBC are lifting the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> up 1.3 percent, helping the market off earlier weakness
in Asia. 
    As you can see, Italy <.FTMIB> was the standout gainer, up 2.7 percent, while the German DAX
<.GDAXI> is also up a solid 2 percent as the rally in autos overshadows possible political risk
the euro zone's largest economy. [nS8N1WD01U]

    Futures are indicating an open in positive territory even if there isn’t that much to cheer
up markets this morning between slower growth in China, another electoral blow for Merkel in
Hesse or the UK budget with an elusive promise to end austerity in Brexit-Britain.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES OPEN HIGHER (0713 GMT) 
    European futures have opened unequivocally in positive territory despite weakness in Asia,
particularly in China, and U.S futures trading in the red. 
    Indications from spreadbetters seeing a positive open in Europe are proving to be accurate:

    NOT MUCH OF A REBOUND IN SIGHT (0649 GMT) 
    The fact that S&P and Dow futures are in negative territory isn't doing much to beef up
morale and the same can be said about the end of the trading session in Asia.
    MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up just 0.13 percent and Chinese shares
took a hit as more evidence got about the economy slowing down. 
    There's really nothing much out there to substantiate hopes in a rebound just right now. 
    ""Stocks in Europe are expected to open around half a percentage point higher at the start of
the week providing some early relief, although as we’ve seen in the past in such environments,
this can very quickly change"", wrote Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. 
    It also looks unlikely that the UK budget, even with a promise to end austerity, or Merkel's
latest electoral defeat, will boost risk taking across European markets.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European shares climbed and Wall
Street was set for a stronger open on Monday thanks to a surge
in autos stocks and relief that Italy dodged a ratings
downgrade.
    Europe's autos sector <.SXAP> jumped 4.9 percent, set for
its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China
was considering halving the tax on car purchases in an attempt
to boost demand for autos, which has been hurt by a trade war
and slowing economic growth. [nL8N1X92LH] [nL3N1X940G]
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> jumped 2.1 percent by 1310 GMT,
boosted by carmakers BMW <BMWG.DE>, Daimler <DAIGn.DE> and
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, while the leading index of euro zone
stocks <.STOXX50E> rose 1.5 percent. 
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> led the market with a 2.4 percent
gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low
following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign
rating unchanged, prompting relief there was no ratings
downgrade. [nL8N1X92J0]
    This also pushed Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> up as much
as 4.5 percent, set for their strongest day since Sept. 10.
    Strong gains across Europe helped boost U.S. stock futures
back into the positive, with the Nasdaq futures <NQc1> up 1.4
percent, S&P 500 futures <ESc1> up 1.1 percent and Dow Jones
futures <1YMc1> up 0.7 percent.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tracking shares
in 47 countries, extended early gains to rise 0.4 percent. The
index is down 9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7
trillion in market capitalisation since its January peak.
    Investors shrugged off news German Chancellor Angela Merkel
would not seek re-election as party chairwoman, as she said she
would serve her full term as chancellor until 2021. Analysts saw
little likelihood of policy disruption. [nL8N1X92EG]
    Her decision, which followed bruising losses for her
Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse, heralded
the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. 
    Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting
on a turnaround in risk. 
    ""The only way I can summarize the core sentiment among the
European investors I met is something like 'pretty grim',"" wrote
Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, in a note to
clients.
    Overnight Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s
blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent.
    Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as
profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth
consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw
materials and manufactured goods. [nL3N1X700R]
    Global financial markets have been hit by negative factors
from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict to tensions in
Europe over Italy's budget and tightening monetary policy.
    Many indices are already in official correction territory
amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global
growth.
    ""With the volatility of the last week or so, today’s
stronger open to markets should not be seen as a sea change but
more a pause for breath,"" said Edward Park, investment director
at Brooks Macdonald. 
    Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European
earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak
results from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S.
stocks at the end of last week.
    
    BOLSONARO WIN BOOSTS EMERGING STOCKS
    Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> built on early gains to
climb 0.7 percent in their first rise in five sessions after
far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the runoff in Brazil's
presidential election. [nL2N1X803H]
    Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed on his win.
Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust <BRLA.L>
London-listed shares gained 8.4 percent while a Germany-listed
iShares MSCI Brazil ETF <MBRABRL.DE> climbed 5.8 percent.
    ""Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is
that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing
the country's competitiveness,"" said UBS analysts. 
    Foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued with the
dollar index leading, up 0.3 percent. 
    The euro <EUR=> fell on the Merkel news, down 0.2 percent at
$1.1381. Sterling <GBP=> dipped 0.1 percent, near a two-month
trough of $1.2775 before Britain’s annual budget due later on
Monday. 
    Finance minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his
divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push
for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of
austerity.
    In commodities, oil prices dipped as investors priced in
growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude <CLc1> fell 43
cents to $67.17 per barrel and Brent crude <LCOc1> slid 44 cents
to $77.18.

in the third quarter, albeit not as much as expected despite a
rebound in consumer spending and a stronger business investment,
according to data from the INSEE official statistics agency.
    The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4 percent in
the quarter, up from 0.2 percent in the previous three months, 
INSEE said on Tuesday in a first estimate for the July-September
period.
    However, the reading fell slightly short of an average
estimate for 0.5 percent growth in a Reuters poll of 31
economists. <FRGDPP=ECI>
    Household spending, traditionally the motor of French
growth, grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter after falling 0.1
percent in the previous three months as strikes hit spending on
transport in particular.
    Meanwhile, business investment accelerated slightly to 1.4
percent in the quarter as firms stepped up outlays on digital
technology while household investment, essentially new home
purchases, declined in line with recent falls in housing starts.
    Export growth outpaced that for imports, which meant that
foreign trade added 0.1 percentage points to overall growth,
while business inventory drawdowns subtracted 0.2 percentage
points.

    * Merkel giving up on party leadership and re-election
    * New hiatus seen holding up possible euro zone reforms
    * Regional elections have seen eurosceptic gains
    * But some see possible new EU reform push from Berlin

    By Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's announcement
that she will step down as party leader and, in time, as German
chancellor jams a wrench into EU reforms but might just
eventually, some think, invigorate Berlin's key role in European
integration.
    Merkel, 64, said her fourth term, ending in 2021, would be
her last. For many European Union policymakers and analysts
picking over a historic day, the consequence is likely to be
prolonged paralysis and a Germany less inclined to share its
wealth and locked in confrontation with its neighbours.
    Some, though, see at least a chance that the shock,
triggered by poor regional election results, could in time lead
to a new coalition more committed to strengthening the EU. This
might mean a role for the resurgent, europhile Greens, or Merkel
herself seeking to burnish her European legacy in defiance of
many of her own Christian Democrats in parliament.
    ""For the European Union, this comes at the worst possible
moment to have (agree) anything at the December Council,"" said
Lucas Guttenberg, deputy director in Berlin of the Jacques
Delors Institute think-tank, devoted to European integration.
    Pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron and others to
agree measures to strengthen the shared euro currency may be
frustrated again at the Dec. 13-14 summit, as Merkel may have to
defer on key issues to a new CDU leader chosen a week earlier.
    While ministers have agreed some minor tweaks to euro zone
rules, Macron's ambitions for a grand new construction - and
hopes for wider EU reforms in the wake of Brexit - must be
dimmed: ""Her room for manoeuvre was already quite constrained,""
said Guttenberg, noting that it took six months to form Merkel's
present coalition. ""For Macron or others, it's not good news.""
    For others, however, a showdown with Italy over its plans
for a radically expansive budget next year despite big debts has
already killed off much ambition in Brussels, making Merkel's
weaker position in Berlin less of a deciding factor.
    
    ELECTION TROUBLE
    Rather, her electoral problems showed a further decline for
traditional big parties, a trend that has profited both Macron
and also eurosceptics such as Italy's new ruling coalition,
several EU diplomats in Brussels and other capitals said.
    And in that, the dimming of Merkel's influence after 13
years as Europe's key power-broker could mean trouble ahead as
EU leaders try to resolve new confrontations.
    ""Germany will be absent,"" said a senior diplomat in eastern
Europe. ""Getting things done will be even more complicated.""
    Merkel played a key role in tempering German hawks when it
came to north-south divides over public finances in the euro
zone. More recently, she has helped to bridge splits between
east and west over EU subsidies and civil rights, drawing in
part on her experience of living in Soviet-bloc East Germany.
    ""For central and eastern Europe, having someone as German
chancellor who actually knows what it is to live under Communist
dictatorship was an enormous privilege, the importance of which
we will only really learn when it's over,"" the eastern diplomat
said.
    Guttenberg at the Delors Institute expected Germany to
maintain its broadly pro-EU consensus and stick to established
lines on Britain's new place outside the bloc and in resisting
Rome's bid to tear up spending rules.
    But ""constructive"" moves to deepen integration would be on
hold: ""I do not expect revolutions.""
    
    MACRON MOMENT?
    On the other side, economists at Citibank wrote that
electoral success for the Greens could be positive for those
seeing euro zone reform as good for the economy and even provoke
a ""Macron moment"" in Germany, with the emergence of a broadly
backed centrist movement to tackle problems.
    ""The rise of the pro-EU Greens (is) a significant potential
positive, at least for the euro zone,"" they wrote.
    Among sceptics, however, is Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian
co-leader of the Greens in the EU parliament, who noted that
Green successes have been matched by the rise of eurosceptics:
""If Merkel loses control of the CDU, it is the very idea of
European integration in Germany that will lose.""
    One hope, he said, was that Merkel could now afford to spend
her political capital on pushing Germans to accept changes that
would mould the euro less to their own national advantage - a
view echoed by ING Germany economist Carsten Brzeski, who wrote:
    ""It could give Merkel the freedom and tailwind ... to put a
final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform
the German economy and the monetary union.""
    At the Friends of Europe think-tank in Brussels, chairman
Giles Merritt argued that Merkel has brought ""inertia"" to the
EU, and a failure to rein in German surpluses that have strained
the single currency to breaking point, threatening the Union.
    ""Fears of post-Merkel volatility and even chaos are
understandable, but short-sighted,"" said Merritt. ""It's to be
hoped that the prospect of her stepping down will act as a
catalyst and bring home to German voters their greater
self-interest, which is European cohesion, not short-term gain.""

    MADRID, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA <BBVA.MC> said on
Tuesday its third-quarter net profit rose 46 percent, buoyed by
one-off capital gains in Chile and a solid performance in Mexico
that partially offset pressure on lending income.
    Spain's second-largest bank reported net profit of 1.67

in line with analysts' forecasts.
    Excluding one-off operations, net profit in the quarter

euros after it completed the sale of a 68 percent stake in BBVA
Chile to Scotiabank on July 6. [nL5N1VS5AL]
    As with other European banks, Spanish lenders are struggling
to improve their financial margins due to ultra-low interest
rates.
    Overall, net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on
loans minus deposit costs, was 4.26 billion euros in the third
quarter, down 3.3 percent from a year ago and down 2.3 percent
from the preceding quarter.
    Analysts had forecast a NII of 4.13 billion euros.
    In Argentina, where the bank makes less than 5 percent of
its operating income, the bank booked a loss of 190 million 
euros in the quarter after it restated its financial statement
to take into account hyperinflation.
    In Turkey, the lender's fourth-biggest market after Mexico,
Spain, and the United States, BBVA's net profit dived 40.7
percent after the lira slumped in August.
    In its main market of Mexico, the company's net profit
climbed 18.5 percent to 642 million euros, underpinned by
stronger lending activity.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives urged the head of the

party leader after poor election results, in an interview
published on Tuesday.
    Merkel said on Monday that her fourth term as chancellor
would be her last and that she would step down as leader of the
Christian Democrats (CDU), heralding the end of a 13-year era in
which she has dominated European politics. [nL8N1X926U]
    Her decision followed two state elections in Bavaria and
Hesse where the parties in Merkel's governing coalition suffered
heavy losses, a result partly blamed on infighting between the
CDU and its Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party.
    Tobias Hans, CDU premier in the western state of Saarland,
called on CSU leader Horst Seehofer - who as interior minister
in Merkel's federal government unsettled voters by criticising
the chancellor - to follow suit and step down.
    ""The fact is that Angela Merkel has given an example of how
to take responsibility after a poor election result,"" Hans told
Die Welt newspaper.
    ""Angela Merkel has managed to deliver a self-determined
departure as party leader, this is also my wish for colleague
Horst Seehofer,"" Hans added.
    There was no immediate response from Seehofer.
    Several CDU politicians have announced they want to succeed
Merkel as party leader at a conference in December, including
CDU party secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a close
Merkel ally, and Health Minister Jens Spahn who is one of her
fiercest critics. [nL8N1X94U2]

    By Leigh Thomas
    PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - French economic growth picked up
by less than expected in the three months to September despite a
rebound in consumer spending, official data showed on Tuesday,
putting pressure on the government's full year growth forecast.
    The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4 percent in
the third quarter, up from 0.2 percent in the previous three
months, the INSEE statistics agency said in a first estimate for
the period.
    ""Today’s outturn marks the return of where French GDP growth
should be at this stage of the business cycle – above potential,
absorbing slack – and with it, should mark the end of material
underperformance against the euro area,"" Barclays economist
Francois Cabau said in a research note.
    However, the reading fell short of an average estimate for
0.5 percent growth in a Reuters poll of 31 private sector
economists, as well as INSEE's own 0.5 percent forecast. 
    Economists said the reading meant the economy would need to
grow by about 0.8 percent in the last quarter to attain the 1.7
percent rate the government is forecasting for the full year.
    Morgan Stanley economist Matthew Pennil said fourth quarter
growth was likely to be closer to 0.4 percent judging by recent
business confidence surveys and despite a cut in workers'
welfare contributions this month.
    ""Volatility in quarterly growth this year has largely been
driven by tax policy,"" Pennil said.
    ""Measures that lowered household incomes early this year are
only now being offset by reductions in social contributions,
which are fueling a recovery in consumer spending.""
         
    BREAKDOWN
    Household spending, traditionally the motor of French
growth, grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter after falling 0.1
percent in the previous three months, when strikes hit spending
on transport in particular. 
    ""We have a return to normal rather than the recovery of lost
ground since the last quarter of 2017,"" Euler Hermes economist
Stephane Colliac told Reuters.
    Business investment accelerated slightly to 1.4 percent in
the quarter, remaining the main source of momentum as firms
respond positively to President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business
reform push. Household investment, essentially new home
purchases, declined in line with recent falls in housing starts.
    Export growth outpaced that for imports, which meant that
foreign trade added 0.1 percentage points to overall growth,
while business inventory drawdowns subtracted 0.2 percentage
points.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Soured credit, cybercrime and
Brexit are among the biggest risks facing euro zone banks in
2019, the European Central Bank said on Tuesday, as it set out
its supervisory priorities for the year ahead. 
    The euro zone's growth has reduced overall economic
uncertainty, but global risk factors from protectionism to a
hard Brexit and emerging-market turmoil are growing and warrant
closer monitoring, the central bank said. It keeps watch over
118 of the biggest euro zone banks. 
    ""Compared to last year, there has been a substantial
decrease in risks stemming from economic and fiscal conditions
in the euro area, mostly due to a favourable cyclical momentum,""
the ECB said in a regular risk assessment exercise.
    ""At the same time, geopolitical uncertainties and risks of
repricing in financial markets have increased. Advances in
digitalisation exacerbate the risks related to banks’ legacy IT
systems and cyberattacks.""
    Other notable risks include a repricing in financial markets
and the impact of record-low interest rates on bank
profitability, it added.
    With regard to Brexit, the ECB stressed that banks need to
be ready for any outcome, since no agreement has been reached
just months before Britain is due to exit the European Union. 
    ""Banks' preparedness for Brexit remains a high priority for
ECB Banking Supervision,"" the ECB said. ""ECB Banking Supervision
will further prepare to take over the direct supervision of a
number of institutions that are newly identified as significant
owing to the Brexit-induced relocation of activities.""
    It added that it will continue to press banks to reduce
their stock of non-performing loans after notable progress this
year and will also scrutinize lending practices to mitigate
potential risks.
    It will also conduct a targeted review of banks' internal
models for calculating risk to reduce unwarranted deviation from
its own expectation.

than expected in the third quarter and economic confidence
continued to fall, official estimates showed on Tuesday, as
signs of distress became more evident in Italy, the bloc's third
biggest economy.
    The European statistics office Eurostat said economic growth
in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed to 0.2 percent in
the third quarter against the previous three months, after a 0.4
percent expansion in the second quarter. 
    Year-on-year euro zone growth slowed to 1.7 percent from 2.2
percent in the second quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had
expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 1.8 percent
year-on-year rise.
    Eurostat does not provide national data in its flash
estimates, but figures released earlier on Tuesday by the
Italian statistics agency showed Italy's growth had halted in
the third quarter amid a row with the European Union over the
country's budget for next year [nR1N1W500K].
    In a separate release, the European Commission said on
Tuesday economic sentiment dropped in the euro zone for the
tenth consecutive month, and by more than expected by
economists.
    The indicator, that shows managers and consumers' morale,
fell to 109.8 points in October from 110.9 in September in its
biggest dip since March.
    Although it remains above the long-term average, the
indicator has been falling since the beginning of the year after
having risen steadily in 2017.
    In October the largest fall was recorded in retail services
as managers held ""much grimmer views on the present and expected
business situation,"" the Commission said and the indicator of
selling price expectations dropped. 
    Confidence in industry and services also went down, while
consumer sentiment grew slightly on improved savings
expectations.
    Among euro zone countries, economic morale fell in Germany,
France and Italy, the three largest economies of the bloc, while
it grew in Spain.
    In Italy the downward trend, which is coupled with economic
stagnation in the third quarter, began in July, the month after
a eurosceptic government took office in Rome.
    Outside the euro zone, Britain recorded a slight increase of
economic sentiment, driven up by more optimism in retail trade
and services which more than offset a fall in industry
confidence.

 (Recasts with Africa summit)
    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
hosts African leaders on Tuesday in a drive to tackle
underdevelopment on the continent that helped to spur mass
migration, shaping the later years of her long premiership.
    Merkel announced on Monday she would retire from politics by
2021, sending shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to
succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 leaders including South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and
Rwanda's Paul Kagame, is designed to showcase the continent as a
stable destination for German investment.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which along with political instability and violence has
encouraged large numbers to head for Europe.
    ""We have to make sure we don't stay in aid mode,"" Merkel's
Africa coordinator Guenter Nooke told public radio. ""The many
millions of jobs we need in Africa can't be created with public
money.""
    If Merkel is to ensure the leadership of her Christian
Democrat party passes to a centrist ally, such as current
general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, she needs to show
that she has made progress in fixing the conditions that led to
her fateful decision three years ago.
    Other candidates, including Health Minister Jens Spahn or
her old rival, the strongly pro-business Friedrich Merz, are
well to her right politically and could be expected to want to
challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to
refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as
Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of
the human tide.
    The crisis upturned European politics, revitalising the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    But officials around the chancellor believe that migration
can only be slowed sustainably by removing the ""push"" factors of
unemployment and instability in Africa, something that will only
be exacerbated by climate change.
    Officials hope that the summit, attended also by Christine
Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
will encourage more companies to invest on the continent,
creating jobs that aid has failed to do. 
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
has said she will not seek re-election as leader of the
centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) at a congress in
December. Merkel, 64, also ruled out running for a fifth term as
chancellor in 2021.
    Several CDU politicians have announced bids to succeed
Merkel as party leader. Here are some facts about the candidates
who could step into Merkel's shoes:
            
    THE MINI-MERKEL
    Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, probably has the best chance
of becoming the next CDU leader after Merkel herself decided in
February to name her as party secretary general - a move seen as
a succession plan.
    Dubbed a ""mini-Merkel"" by German media due to their sober
political styles, Kramp-Karrenbauer was premier of the tiny
state of Saarland on the French border from 2011 to 2018.
    Her Catholic, western German background contrasts with
Merkel's Protestant, eastern roots. While socially conservative
and known for opposing gay marriage, Kramp-Karrenbauer is also a
strong supporter of the minimum wage and workers' rights.
    In an attempt to distance herself from Merkel and her
leadership style, Kramp-Karrenbauer has said the CDU will need
to regain some passion if it wants to attract younger voters.
    Sometimes known as AKK, she is the daughter of a teacher for
mentally handicapped children, and is married to a mining
engineer, with whom she has three children.
           
    THE CRITIC
    Jens Spahn, 38, has become one of Merkel's most outspoken
critics within the CDU since her decision in 2015 to welcome
more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims from war zones in
the Middle East.
    He positions himself as a politician from Germany's rural
northwest who is sceptical of urban liberals and the globalist
elite.
    In an attempt to rein Spahn in, Merkel this year named him
health minister - a thorny portfolio that brings a lot of work
and few headlines.
    A member of the lower house of parliament since 2002, Spahn
has been praised as a rising star for years by senior
conservatives such as Wolfgang Schaeuble.
    However, his anti-immigration rhetoric at the height of the
refugee crisis cost him sympathy among Merkel allies.
    His public friendship with Richard Grenell, U.S. President
Donald Trump's ambassador to Berlin, has also alienated some
conservatives who dislike Trump's policy style.
    Like Kramp-Karrenbauer, Spahn is a Catholic but, despite the
church's opposition to gay partnerships, he is married to Daniel
Funke, a senior journalist at the glossy magazine Bunte.
        
    THE OUTSIDER
    Friedrich Merz, 62, was the first to throw his hat into the
ring on Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again
as CDU leader, according to party sources. He confirmed his
plans officially on Tuesday.
    Merz, a member of the CDU's conservative wing, has coined
the idea of a German 'Leitkultur', or 'lead culture', with which
he called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German
values and traditions.
    He also is known for his proposal to simplify the annual tax
return so that it could be written on a beer mat.
    Merz is among the many conservative men who have seen their
political fortunes dwindle under Merkel.
    In 2002, Merkel pushed him out of his position as CDU
parliamentary leader to cement her grip on the party, on her way
to becoming chancellor in 2005.
    A trained lawyer and former member of the European
Parliament, Merz served in the German parliament from 1994 to
2009, and now holds numerous non-executive company board
positions, including chairman of the German arm of the U.S.
hedge fund BlackRock.
    He is married to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has
three children.

    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Italy's economy stagnated in the
third quarter, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the zero
growth justified Rome's expansionary 2019 budget which the
European Commission has rejected because it breaks EU rules.
    Gross domestic product was unchanged between July and
September, following a 0.2 percent rise in the second quarter,
and was up just 0.8 percent on an annual basis, national
statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
    The flat quarterly reading was the weakest since the fourth
quarter of 2014, and continues a steady slowdown in Italian
growth over the last 18 months.
    ""The figures were expected, which is why we presented an
expansionary budget,"" Conte told reporters during a visit to
India.
    Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is in Doha, gave
the same message. ""The slowing GDP is another reason to go full
steam ahead with the budget,"" he said on Facebook. 
    This month the government, which took office in June, cut
the full-year 2018 GDP growth forecast to 1.2 percent from a 1.5
percent projection made in April by the previous administration.
    After the third quarter stagnation, achieving even the
revised target would need a strong acceleration at the end of
the year.
    The new coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement
and the right-wing League has presented a big-spending 2019
budget it says is needed to prevent Italy's chronically sluggish
economy slipping into another recession.
    However the budget, which targets the deficit to rise to 2.4
percent of GDP in 2019 from 1.8 percent this year, was rejected
last week by the European Commission.
    The EU executive said Italy was flouting a previous
commitment to lower the deficit steadily towards a balanced
budget, and gave Rome three weeks to present a new budget. The 
government says it has no intention of changing its plans.
    Yields on Italian government bonds rose after the GDP data
and the euro fell. [nL8N1XA3JZ] [nL2N1XA0C5]
    ISTAT said neither trade flows nor domestic demand had made
any contribution to economic growth in the third quarter.
    It gave no numerical breakdown of components with its
preliminary estimate, but said the services and agricultural
sectors expanded while industry was a drag on growth.
    The government has forecast growth will accelerate to 1.5
percent next year thanks to increased investment, tax cuts and a
new income support scheme, known as the ""citizens' wage"", which
it says can boost consumer spending.
    While the weak economy may strengthen Rome's argument that
fiscal expansion is needed, the coalition's forecasts - which
were already above those of virtually all independent economists
- now look increasingly optimistic.
    The third quarter data ""puts an end to the expectations that
the government has that they can base their budget on their
current growth projections"", said ING rates strategist Benjamin
Schroeder. 
    Separately, ISTAT reported that business confidence dropped
in October to its weakest for almost two years, but morale
improved among consumers, possibly buoyed by the budget's
planned tax cuts, welfare benefits and early-retirement option.

    That was the highest reading since February 2012 and in line

preliminary numbers showed, matching the consensus forecast.

    LISBON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A priest in a white robe swings
an incense burner, leading the way for thousands of marchers as
they cram into a winding cobblestone alley decorated with
candy-colored streamers in Lisbon's ancient Alfama neighborhood.
    Behind the priest, six men carry a life-sized statue of
Saint Anthony, Lisbon's patron saint, born more than 800 years
ago. The musky incense swirls together with the smoke from
orange-hot charcoals grilling whole sardines a few streets away.
The procession moves along, leaving behind just the smell of the
sardines. 
    In this city, June is the month to celebrate the saints.
Almost every neighborhood throws a party, known as an arraial.
Some are just a scattering of makeshift tables in alleyways.
Others cover several blocks and are jammed with tourists and
locals alike. The saints are quickly forgotten in the din of
pumping pop music, longing fado songs, brass bands, chattering
families, indiscreet lovers and flirty teens. The sardines are
not. They're the star of every party. 
    The fish are so popular here, fisheries managers estimate
that the Portuguese collectively eat 13 sardines every second
during a typical June – about 34 million fish for the month.
    But as climate change warms the seas and inland estuaries,
sardines are getting harder and harder to catch. Just a week
before the festival, authorities postponed sardine fishing in
some ports out of a fear that the diminishing population,
vulnerable to changes in the Atlantic's water temperatures, was
being overfished. 
    In the last few decades, the world's oceans have undergone
the most rapid warming on record. Currents have shifted. These
changes are for the most part invisible. But this hidden climate
change has had a disturbing impact on marine life – in effect,
creating an epic underwater refugee crisis.
    Drawing on decades of maritime temperature readings, fishery
records and other little-used data, Reuters has undertaken an
extensive exploration of the disrupted deep. A team of reporters
has discovered that from the waters off the East Coast of the
United States to the shores of West Africa, marine creatures are
fleeing for their lives, and the communities that depend on them
are facing turbulence as a result.
    Here in Lisbon, the decline of the country's most beloved
fish tugs at the Portuguese soul. A nation clinging to the
western edge of the European continent, Portugal has always
turned toward the sea. For centuries, it has sent its people
onto the sometimes-treacherous oceans, from famous explorers
like Ferdinand Magellan and Vasco da Gama to little-known
fishermen who left weeping wives on the shore. 
    The St. Anthony's festival commemorates a 13th-century
priest who, church doctrine says, once drew a bay full of fish
to hear his sermon. It is the capital's biggest, most joyous
celebration of the year. 
    At the bottom of the track where two bright yellow funicular
trains begin and end an 800-foot vertiginous trip through the
Bica neighborhood, a social club and a local cafe have set up
for the festival. On this night, it's mostly locals, though a
few German and French tourists have found their way to the
party.
    Four friends sit around a wobbly plastic table perched
outside the G.D. Zip Zip social club. There's just enough room
for others to walk past and get to the homemade grill where the
sardines are being cooked. Three of the friends have sardine
skeletons and heads heaped on their plates. They talk about the
fish that's as iconic in Portugal in the summer as a hamburger
on the grill in America. 
    This year, however, because of limits on fishing, it's
mostly only frozen fish that are available.
    ""We listen to it all year round that maybe this year, we
will not have sardines,"" Helena Melo says.
    Fifteen feet up the hill, Jorge Rito, who has been cooking
for the club every June for five years, wipes his watering eyes
with the back of his hand. He's just gotten another order and
tosses a dozen whole sardines onto the grill in neat rows.
    As he flips the silvery fish, each seven or eight inches
long, a burst of smoke rises from the charcoal, and he wipes his
eyes again. 
    ""Worried? Yes, of course,"" he says, removing the fish from
the grill and placing them onto a platter. ""It is important for
our finances, our economies, for us."" 
    
    WARMING WATERS THREATEN BABY SARDINES
    Just as the next generation of humans may pay the highest
price for climate change, the youngest generation of sardines is
at risk.
    Susana Garrido, a sardine researcher with the Portuguese
Oceanic and Atmospheric Institute in Lisbon, says larval
sardines are especially vulnerable to climate change when
compared to other similar pelagic species, such as larval
anchovies, which are capable of living in a wider range of
temperatures.  
    Deep seawater upwelling dominates the waters off the western
coast of the Iberian Peninsula and keeps the coastal waters
cool. But small differences in temperature, especially when
sardines are young, can have a significant impact on whether the
fish larva dies or grows to maturity, Garrido says. 
    Other researchers had tested how well adult sardines
survived in a variety of conditions, and there was little
evidence that environmental variables such as food abundance and
water temperature affected the full-grown fish, she says. So she
focused on the larval stage of the species.
    ""We did a bunch of experiments varying salinity and all of
these other variables, and they survived quite well,"" she says.
""It was when you change temperature that everything, yes, fell
apart. So they have a very narrow range of temperatures where
survival is good."" 
    Garrido says a recently completed stock assessment shows
that the larval sardine population is extremely low.
    ""This is getting very serious,"" she says.
    The Portuguese sardine population started to fall about a
decade ago, even though there were plenty of adults at the time
to sustain large catches. And around the same time, southerly
species, such as chub and horse mackerel, slowly moved in.
    Chub mackerel, a subtropical species that was once found
only in southern Portugal, is now caught all the way up the
coast.
    ""Probably as a consequence of warming, it is now invading
the main spawning area of sardines,"" Garrido says.
    Alexandra Silva, who works down the hall from Garrido, has
been managing the Portuguese sardine stock assessment since the
late 1990s – pivotal work that the organization uses to decide
the size of the sardine catch.
    When she started, the northern population of the species was
in trouble following a period of strong upwelling that brought
unusually cold water to the surface. The southern stock,
however, was relatively healthy. And in the early years of the
century, the species recovered.
    It was not to last. These days, without large numbers of
larvae growing to maturity, the population is near collapse all
along the coast from Galicia in Spain to the southern end of the
Portuguese coast. 
    All officials can do is cut down on the fishing. But larger
forces, especially climate change, are now affecting the stock
in ways that fisheries managers cannot control, the two say.
    Regulators have tried.
    Starting in 2004, they blocked fishing during the spring,
when sardines spawn. And for a while, that seemed to work.
Between 2004 and 2011, the stock remained relatively healthy,
with landings ranging from about 55,000 to 70,000 tons, even if
the population seemed to be dipping. (From the 1930s to the
1960s, and as recently as the 1980s, fishermen landed more than
110,000 tons in a year.)
    In 2009, the Portuguese proudly announced that the Marine
Stewardship Council, an independent monitoring body, had
designated the species healthy and sustainable. That year,
Portuguese fishermen landed 64,000 tons of the fish. By 2012,
however, that number had dropped to 35,000 tons, and the country
lost its sustainable certification. Since then, fisheries
managers have restricted the number of days a week that
fishermen can catch sardines, the size of the catch, and
restricted fishing to only six months during a year. 
    Last year, the catch was limited to about 14,000 tons.
    Earlier this year, the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea, a forum of scientists that advises
governments about fishery management, warned that it would take
at least 15 years to restore the stock at current fishing
levels. After the report, European Union regulators permitted
fishermen along the Iberian coast to continue at the current
16,100-ton level. But it also required Portugal, which gets the
bulk of the quota, and Spain to submit a plan to restore the
stock in October, which may well lead to further quota cuts.
    Fisheries manager Jorge Abrantes handles landings for
Peniche, a sleepy fishing town about 60 miles north of Lisbon.
He doesn't think the fishing industry is the culprit.
    For example, Portuguese government stock assessments
indicated that the sardine population had decreased by 10
percent to 25 percent in just a few months. Abrantes argues that
the dip clearly wasn't caused by fishermen pulling sardines from
the sea, because no sardine nets were in the water during that
period. Instead, he says, there are just not enough juvenile
sardines to replenish the population. 
    In Peniche, fishermen Erbes Martins and João Dias sit among
piles of nets on a bright but chilly February morning. The two
75-year-old men would prefer to be fishing for sardines. But the
fish are spawning, so they're not allowed to catch them.
    Sure, there are other fish they could catch, but it's not
worth it, they say.
    Horse mackerel, or carapau in Portuguese, one of the
southerly species that now thrive all along the coast, is
abundant but doesn't sell for much at market, Dias says.
    ""We can't fish for sardines in October, November, December,
January, February, March, six months,"" Dias says. ""And carapau
just doesn't pay the bills."" 
    He says the restrictions on fishing sardines are keeping a
new generation from going to sea, because they can't make enough
money.
    ""When we die,"" he says, ""no one is going to do the work."" 
    
    'I WOULD MISS THIS VERY MUCH'
    Lisbon's Graça neighborhood sits at the highest point in the
capital, its pastel homes looking down over the city's six other
hills. For the St. Anthony festival, two stages have been set up
for music, along with about 20 temporary food and drink stalls.
    Luis Diogo Sr., his wife, Rita, and their two children, Luis
Jr. and Vera, have come out to join the party. Luis Sr. looks
across a picnic table at his son, who is well into his third
plate of sardines. 
    ""This is a country between Spain and the sea, so we went to
the sea very soon in our history,"" he says. The talk turns to
the present, and the dwindling catch of the city's favorite
seafood.
    Luis Jr. doesn't pay much attention to his father. He's too
focused on his sardines. 
    ""I would miss this very much,"" the 17-year-old says, wiping
his lips clean after polishing off the last sardine on his
plate.

Tuesday it was investigating whether a planned joint venture
between Indian steelmaker Tata Steel and Germany's ThyssenKrupp
could reduce competition in the high-end steel sector.
    Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are major producers of flat
carbon steel and electrical steel with significant production

carbon steel and electrical steel businesses and the Commission
said that this raised concerns over their dominance in steel for
cars, metallic coated steel for packaging and grain oriented
electrical steel.

    BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European
Commission has opened a deeper investigation into Thyssenkrupp's
<TKAG.DE> planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel <TISC.NS>
over concerns that it could raise prices and harm competition.
    The so-called Phase II investigation was widely expected and
follows a similar probe into ArcelorMittal's <MT.AS> takeover of
Italy's Ilva, which was cleared only after the group pledged to
sell assets. [nL8N1TV6BY] [nS8N1QI011] [nL8N1WS1BV]
    Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel earlier this year unveiled plans
to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands
and Britain to become the continent's second-largest steelmaker
after ArcelorMittal.
    ""The Commission is concerned that, following the
transaction, customers would face a reduced choice in suppliers,
as well as higher prices,"" the EU executive said in a statement.
    ""These customers include various European companies, ranging
from major corporations to numerous small and medium-size
enterprises,"" it added.
    The Commission identified three areas where the combination
of both companies' specialty flat carbon steel and electrical
steel products could give them a dominant position: steel for
the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and
grain oriented electrical steel.
    Tata Steel's European unit has already put a number of
assets on the block, including Cogent, a manufacturer and
processor of electrical steels, and it is unclear whether these
divestments would satisfy EU concerns. [nFWN1SF0YV]
    The Commission now has 90 working days, until March 19,
2019, to investigate the matter and take a decision.
    A spokeswoman for Thyssenkrupp said that the group would
continue to work closely with the Commission, adding that the
deepened probe was expected and standard for a transaction of
this size.
    The move is nonetheless fuelling expectations that the deal
will require asset disposals to win approval. [nL8N1U02P8]
    Analysts expect few problems regarding crude steel
production, where ratings agency Moody's reckons the venture
will control just 14 percent of the European market, a distant
second to ArcelorMittal's 29 percent, which includes Ilva.
    But the new company, to be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, 
would have a share of about 50 percent of the European packaging
steel, or tinplate, market, a person familiar with the industry
told Reuters.
    Rasselstein, Thyssenkrupp's packaging steel unit, posted
sales of 1.16 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in the 2015/2016
fiscal year and employed about 2,400 workers.

    By Giulia Segreti
    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Major companies on Tuesday ruled
out involvement in a new rescue of Alitalia, complicating a plan
led by Rome in which state-controlled railway Ferrovie dello
Stato (FS) <IPO-FERRO.MI> will bid for the airline this week and
bring in partners.  
    Alitalia was put under special administration last year, 
leaving the government once again looking to find a buyer to
save the carrier. It will be the airline's third rescue in a
decade.  
    FS is due to present an offer for the whole of Alitalia on
Wednesday subject to a series of conditions. 
    FS's offer would only be a ""transitional phase"", a source
close to the deal told Reuters. 
    The source added the deal would be completed in two separate
steps, with FS picking up Alitalia on set conditions and then,
at a later stage, being joined by an Italian partner and a
international one, from the airline sector. 
    The source added there was very little visibility on next
steps, and it was not clear which partners would join FS.
    ""The situation is very messy,"" the source said. 
    Earlier this month Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio
suggested that state-controlled companies like oil major Eni
<ENI.MI>, postal operator Poste <PST.MI> and defence group
Leonardo <LDOF.MI> could all play a role in the relaunch. 
    Di Maio, also industry minister, said that there were many
private investors also interested in Alitalia. [nS8N1RT01Q] 
    But on Tuesday Eni said that any suggestion that it might
pick up a stake in the carrier was ""groundless"" and that it
would not play a role in the rescue, a spokesperson said.
    Leonardo too will not join any relaunch of Alitalia, which
has already accumulated a loss of over 300 million euros
($340.86 million), a separate source close to the matter told
Reuters.
    ""It would be crazy for Leonardo to enter this madness,"" the
source said. Shares in the group were down almost 1.5 percent at
1600 GMT after Italian dailies had reported that the company
would be involved in an effort spearheaded by FS.   
    Last month Poste Chief Executive Matteo del Fante said the
group was ""not at all interested"" in joining an overhaul effort
for the airline.
    
    CASH DRAIN 
    Alitalia has cost Italian tax payers almost 10 billion euros
over the last 20 years, more than the market capitalisation of
Air France-KLM, Turkish Airlines, Norwegian Air, Finnair and SAS
added together, according to Andrea Giuricin, CEO of transport
advisory firm TRA Consulting. 
    Last year Alitalia accounted for only 8.5 percent of the
international traffic to and from Italy, Giuricin added, just
under a third of Ryanair's share.  
    The sale process was delayed due to the change of Italian
government earlier this year, but the ruling coalition, that
comprises the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
far-right League, pledged it would close a deal by Wednesday. 
    Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> said earlier on Tuesday that
it had no interest in participating in a government-led
restructuring effort. [nL8N1XA2FU]
    Alitalia must pay back the Italian state almost 1 billion
euros in a bridge loan and related interest by mid-December.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
has said she will not seek re-election as leader of the
centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) at a congress in
December. Merkel, 64, also ruled out running for a fifth term as
chancellor in 2021. [L8N1XA2I3]
    Several CDU politicians have announced bids to succeed
Merkel as party leader. Here are some facts about the candidates
who could step into her shoes:
            
    THE MINI-MERKEL
    Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, was named by Merkel herself
in February as CDU secretary general - a move seen as the first
step in a succession plan.
    Dubbed a ""mini-Merkel"" by German media due to their sober
political styles, Kramp-Karrenbauer was premier of the tiny
state of Saarland on the French border from 2011 to 2018.
    Her Catholic, western German background contrasts with
Merkel's Protestant, eastern roots. While socially conservative
and known for opposing gay marriage, Kramp-Karrenbauer is also a
strong supporter of the minimum wage and workers' rights.
    In an attempt to distance herself from Merkel and her
leadership style, Kramp-Karrenbauer has said the CDU will need
to regain some passion if it wants to attract younger voters.
    Sometimes known as AKK, she is the daughter of a teacher for
mentally handicapped children, and is married to a mining
engineer, with whom she has three children.
    About 19 percent of Germans view Kramp-Karrenbauer as a good
successor for Merkel, according to a poll conducted for Spiegel
Online by the Civey institute. 
           
    THE CRITIC
    Jens Spahn, 38, has become one of Merkel's most outspoken
critics within the CDU since her decision in 2015 to welcome
more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims from war zones in
the Middle East.
    He positions himself as a politician from Germany's rural
northwest who is sceptical of urban liberals and the globalist
elite.
    In an attempt to rein Spahn in, Merkel this year named him
health minister - a thorny portfolio that brings a lot of work
and few headlines.
    A member of the lower house of parliament since 2002, Spahn
has been praised as a rising star for years by senior
conservatives such as former finance minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
    However, his anti-immigration rhetoric at the height of the
refugee crisis cost him sympathy among Merkel allies.
    His public friendship with Richard Grenell, U.S. President
Donald Trump's ambassador to Berlin, has also alienated some
conservatives who dislike Trump's populist style.
    Like Kramp-Karrenbauer, Spahn is a Catholic but, despite the
church's opposition to gay partnerships, he is married to Daniel
Funke, a senior journalist at the glossy magazine Bunte.
    The Civey poll showed Spahn with just six percent support.
        
    THE OUTSIDER
    The most popular candidate, according to polls, is Friedrich
Merz, 62, who was the first to throw his hat into the ring on
Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again as CDU
leader. He confirmed his plans officially on Tuesday.
    Merz, a member of the CDU's conservative wing, has coined
the idea of a German ""Leitkultur"" (lead culture), with which he
called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German
values and traditions.
    Thirty-four percent of Germans view Merz as the best
successor for Merkel, the Civey poll showed.
    He also is known for his proposal to simplify the annual tax
return so that it could be written on a beer mat.
    Merz is among the many conservative men who have seen their
political fortunes dwindle under Merkel.
    In 2002, Merkel pushed him out of his position as CDU
parliamentary leader to cement her grip on the party, on her way
to becoming chancellor in 2005.
    A trained lawyer and ex-member of the European Parliament,
Merz served in the German parliament from 1994-2009, and now
holds numerous non-executive company board positions, including
chairman of the German arm of the U.S. hedge fund BlackRock.
    He is married to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has
three children.

the Socialist government's 2019 budget bill on Tuesday, setting

economic growth, and with more income for families in an
election year.
    Government allies in parliament - the Communist Party and
Left Bloc, who along with the Socialists hold 122 seats in the
230-seat house, voted for the bill in the first reading. It
envisages the lowest deficit in Portugal's democratic history,
at 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
    It also raises pensions, public sector wages, and earmarks 
more investment in healthcare.
    The centre-right opposition Social Democrats and
conservative CDS-PP voted against.

    LISBON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament approved
the Socialist government's 2019 budget bill on Tuesday, setting
the scene to nearly eliminate the deficit amid projected healthy
economic growth and with more income for families.
    Portugal, which only emerged from a debt crisis in 2014, has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with policies  to support
strong growth under the centre-left administration, while
reversing many unpopular austerity measures during a bailout.
    Its example, often lauded by Brussels, is in sharp contrast 
to Italy's plans to widen the budget deficit in 2019. The plans,
opposed by the European Commission, have unnerved investors,
causing Italy's bond yields to rise well past Portuguese ones.
    Finance Minister Mario Centeno said it was precisely
Portugal's fiscal performance in line with EU budget
requirements that had helped slash its financing costs, allowing
to use the saved money for what he called ""an enormous relief of
the tax burden"", while also narrowing the budget gap.
    Government allies in parliament - the Communist Party and
Left Bloc, who along with the Socialists hold 122 seats in the
230-seat house, voted for the bill.
    The centre-right opposition Social Democrats and
conservative CDS-PP voted against, criticising the bill as an
election year gimmick while pointing to a slowing growth they
say will ultimately undermine the budget consolidation.
