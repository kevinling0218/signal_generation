0,3,8632a7c603f177cce59c43cdee4a3e15,UPDATE 1-Four charged with Slovak reporter's murder ordered held pending trial,2018-10-01 0:22:12,EUR,-1.24666,2018-10-01 0:22:23,{'EUR': 'Very Negative'}," (Adds details on fourth suspect, background)
    BRATISLAVA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A Slovak court on Sunday
ordered four people jailed until their trial for the murder of
investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, a state
prosecutor said.
    The February killings sparked nationwide protests that
toppled the government of Robert Fico, who had run Slovakia for
all but two of the past 12 years.
    Three suspects were detained in a house raid on Thursday
morning and charged with murder on Friday. [nL8N1WD2F0]  
    The fourth suspect, a woman detained separately on Friday,
has been charged with participating in the murder, which may
have included helping, planning, ordering or organising the
killing, Kuciak family's lawyer Daniel Lipsic told Reuters.  
    Authorities released no further details on the four suspects
and it is not yet clear when the trial might take place.
    Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud involving
businessmen with Slovak political ties, and the suspected mafia
links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia. [nL8N1W33GJ]
    A prosecutor said this month the February murder was likely
a contract killing related to Kuciak's work.
    His final story, published posthumously, reported on an
Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two
Slovaks who later worked in the office of then-prime minister
Fico.
    Both of the Slovaks resigned, but deny connections to the
murder. Their Italian former business partner has also denied
having connections with the mafia and the murder, but was
detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and
extradited to Italy in May. [nL8N1RX38P]
    Weeks of public protests in March eventually forced the
departure of the long-serving Fico but his three-party coalition
has remained in power under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, who
comes from the Smer party, which Fico still heads.

euro and any critical comments about the single currency are
individual opinions which have nothing to do with the
government's policies, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on
Tuesday.
    Conte spoke after a eurosceptic lawmaker in the ruling
League party said earlier that Italy would benefit from more
favourable economic conditions if it were outside the euro zone,
roiling financial markets. [nR1N1RB01P]
    ""The euro is our currency and for us it is unrenounceable,""
Conte said on Facebook. Any declarations suggesting otherwise
must be seen as ""free and arbitrary opinions that have nothing
to do with the policies of this government,"" he added.
    Conte also played down tensions with the European Union over
Italy's big-spending budget. He said Rome was beginning a
dialogue with EU institutions with ""serenity and respect for
each other's roles,"" and he was confident the government could
show the validity of its budget plans.

 (Updates with European trading, changes dateline)
    By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral
    PARIS/SINGAPORE, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Chicago corn and soybeans held around
their highest in several weeks on Wednesday as rain forecasts caused concern
about the U.S. harvest, while wheat also stayed firm after Russia threatened to
suspend loading in some export zones due to quality issues.
    The most-active soybean contract n the Chicago Board Of Trade <Sv1> was up
0.4 percent at $8.69 a bushel by 1140 GMT, after earlier setting a new 5-1/2
week at $8.70.
    Corn <Cv1> added 0.2 percent to $3.68-1/4, after equalling Tuesday's
three-week peak of $3.69.
    CBOT wheat <Wv1> added 0.4 percent to $5.21-1/4 a bushel, while in Europe
December wheat on Euronext <BL2Z8> was up 1.0 percent at 202.00 euros  ($233.23)
a tonne.
    Russia's agriculture safety watchdog warned that 30 grain loading points in
two export regions could be temporarily suspended for up to 90 days due to
violations of phytosanitary rules which limit the amount of material other than
wheat in a cargo. [nL8N1WI5YN]
    The news led Chicago wheat to turn higher towards the end of Tuesday's
session and again lent support on Wednesday as market participants assessed
whether this would contribute to an expected ebbing in Russian exports.
    ""The idea of a slowdown in Russian shipments was in the air for several
weeks in view of the current high shipment pace leading to high prices on the
Russian internal market,"" consultancy Agritel said in a note.
    A sharp fall in Russian wheat production compared with last year's record
crop has also fuelled speculation about a tailing off in shipments, including
through government restrictions.
    However, the absence of a clear slowdown in Russian exports has curbed price
gains, and the safety watchdog added on Wednesday that it had no immediate plans
to suspend port loading points in the key Krasnodar export region, according to
the RIA news agency. [nR4N1T101Z] 
    Grain markets were also monitoring weather forecasts calling for persistent
rainfall in the U.S. Midwest in the week ahead, which could delay harvesting.
    The USDA said corn and soybean harvests remained ahead of the normal pace as
of Sunday, at 26 and 23 percent complete. <US/COR> <US/SOY>
    The rainy outlook has countered supply pressure from estimates of bumper
harvest yields and large inventories.
    Grain prices also drew support this week from the announcement of a revised
North American trade agreement, which helped ease immediate concern about
fallout from an ongoing trade tussle between the United States and China.
    In a potential boost to domestic corn demand, President Donald Trump is
expected to visit Iowa next week to fulfil a promise to lift a summer ban on
higher ethanol blends of gasoline, according to sources familiar with the plan.

    By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral
    PARIS/SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Chicago corn and soybean futures firmed
on Thursday as the prospect of rain threatened to disrupt harvesting of what are
forecast to be bumper U.S. crops.
    The trend was hesitant, with the market still capped by projections of high
harvest yields and technical resistance on price charts after multi-week highs
for corn and soybeans.
    Grain markets were also awaiting weekly U.S. export data at 1230 GMT for an
update on overseas demand amid a continuing trade dispute that has stifled U.S.
soybean sales to China, the world's top importer of the oilseed. [nL2N1WJ0YZ]
    Wheat also ticked up, supported by uncertainty over Russia's export supplies
and a poor crop outlook in Australia despite the return of rain to some
drought-hit regions. [nL4N1WK0FO]
    The most-active corn contract on the Chicago Board of Trade <Cv1> gained 0.3
percent to $3.65-3/4 at 1118 GMT, while soybeans <Sv1> rose 0.1 percent to $8.62
a bushel.
    CBOT wheat <Wv1> was up 0.6 percent at $5.18-1/4 a bushel.
    Weather projections forecast heavy rain in part of the Midwest in the next
6-10 days, which could hamper corn and soybean harvesting that has been running
ahead of the average pace of recent years. 
    ""This shouldn't really pose any major problem,"" Commerzbank analysts wrote
in a note. ""That said, yield expectations have already been raised so high by
the USDA's latest upward revisions that even minor delays can unsettle
investors.""
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture increased its forecasts for 2018 corn and
soybean yields in its September crop report, reinforcing supply pressure on
prices.
    Grain markets were also assessing export prospects after recent price lows
spurred some fresh demand.
    ""There is some support for corn and soybeans because of rains in the U.S.
Midwest, but for soybeans the bigger picture is that China is buying Brazilian
beans for October and November shipment,"" said one Singapore-based trader at an
international trading company.
    ""The market was expecting China to turn to U.S. soybeans for the last
quarter but that has not happened.""
    China's soybean processors are snapping up record volumes of Brazilian
cargoes for shipment in the fourth quarter, curbing purchases of U.S. crops in
North America's peak marketing season as the trade war between Washington and
Beijing intensifies. [nL4N1WC3LZ]
    The wheat market has been supported by a threat from Russia's agriculture
safety watchdog to suspend loading at some locations, though the agency later
played down the threat. [nL8N1WJ3F5]
    A tender being held on Thursday by top wheat importer Egypt could give a

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London,Frankfurt-October 04: Fitch Ratings has revised the Rating 
Watch on thyssenkrupp AG's (TK) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BB+' 
and Short-Term IDR of 'B' to Negative (RWN) from Positive (RWP). The Rating 
Watch on TK's senior unsecured notes and commercial paper programme - rated at 
'BB+' and 'B', respectively - have also been revised to RWN from RWP.

This rating action follows an announcement by TK that it plans to separate the 
group into two standalone, publicly traded companies. TK's existing ratingswill 
become the ratings of the future thyssenkrupp Materials AG (TKM), which will 
become TK's legal and business successor upon separation, comprising materials 
services, forged technologies and bearings,marine systems and a future 50% stake 
in the steel joint-venture with Tata Steel Limited (TSL).

Upon completion of the separation, Fitch believes that existing ratings will 
potentiallybe lower, reflecting the weaker credit profile and higher cyclicality 
of TKM than TK in its current corporate structure. The RWN is also predicated on 
uncertainties surrounding the details of the future corporate structure and 
management model, as well as the financing composition and allocation of 
existing debt into the newly formed entities.

Following Board approval on 30 September 2018, completion of the separation is 
expected to take another 12 to 18 months and is subject to shareholder approval.

Fitch had placed TK's ratings on RWP on 22 September 2017 after the signing of a 
Memorandum of Understanding with TSL (BB, on Rating Watch Evolving)to set up a 
50/50 JV for steel production.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Separation Creates Two Credits: Upon completion of the separation, TK will have 
evolved into two separate entities with different credit profiles. Fitch assumes 
that the existing ratings will migrate to TKM, TK's legal successor, including 
the materials service, marine systems, forged technologies and bearings and 
steel activities (JV share). TKM will be a leading player in its business 
activities, but will show a higher volatility and overall weaker credit profile 
than the existing group.

TK's capital goods activities - elevator technology (ET), the automotive related 
elements of components technology (CT) and industrial solutions (IS) - will be 
spun off into a newly created thyssenkrupp Industrials AG (TKI). Fitch believes 
TKI's business profile has the potential to show an investment-grade rating 
profile, owing to its mature and established products, good degree of 
diversification and hence limited correlation across divisions.

Strong Industrial Rationale: Fitch believes that the separation follows a sound 
industrial logic, providing both TKI and TKM with a clear strategy and 
separating inherently different business activities. Hereby, both companies can 
focus on their core offerings and respective customers. Fitch also believes that 
any potential costs and loss of synergies arising from the separation will not 
be significant.

Uncertainties to Remain: Key credit considerations, including the separated 
companies' capital structure and debt levels, specifics on the minority stake in 
TKI initially held by TKM to support its capital base, and future management 
models will only emerge over the coming months.

Transformation Reduces Short-Term Visibility: Rating risks related to the 
pending separation include execution risk and possible management distraction 
caused by the separation process, as well as the potential cost of the 
transaction, which TK has not provided any estimate of except a roughly EUR1 
billion one-time tax effect. These risks are exacerbated by TK's challenging 
current trading, including input cost inflation, rising competitive pressure and 
foreign currency volatility, which particularly impact the profitability of CT 
and ET. We also view TK's medium-term targets as rather ambitious.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

TK's rating of 'BB+' reflects a strong business profile, with greater 
diversification than steel-focused peers', in particular closest peer 
ArcelorMittal S.A. (AM, BB+/Positive). AM has greater scale, greater geographic 
diversification and a better cost position than TK. However, AM is only exposed 
to steel, which results in greater earnings volatility.

Conversely, TK has greater exposure to volatile steel earnings, a greater fixed 
cost base and lower production flexibility than capital goods peers, including 
KION GROUP AG (BBB-/Stable) and Atlas Copco AB (A/Stable). These peers also have 
a greater proportion of total sales derived from stable servicing and 
maintenance.

The ratings of TK are constrained by its leverage and cash generation, which are 
poor for its rating. No Country Ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating 
environment aspects impact the rating.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer:

- TK's ratings to migrate to TKM upon successful separation, envisaged by 
mid-2020

- Revenue to decline about 19% pro forma for 2018, reflecting deconsolidation of 
the Steel Europe unit

- Consolidated revenue growth returning to low single-digits in 2019

- EBITDA margin to improve to 6%-7% over 2018-2019 as a result of improved 
pricing and cost-saving measures

- Capex intensity of about 3%, reflecting less capital-intensive industrial core 
operations

- No dividends from the steel JV in the short- to medium-term

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

The ratings are on Rating Watch Negative so positive rating action is unlikely. 
If the spin-off is not completed, TK's rating may be affirmed at 'BB+' following 
a resolution of the Rating Watch.

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

Fitch would expect to resolve the Rating Watch upon the closing of the 
separation, by which all outstanding credit relevant factors, including 
financing and corporate structure details, should have emerged. Upon closing, 
the existing rating will migrate to TKM, which will be a smaller, less 
diversified and more cyclical company than TK in its existing group structure. 
Fitch is unable to quantify the magnitude of any potential downgrade at present.

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

Strong Liquidity: As of 30 June 2018, TK's liquidity profile was supported by 
EUR3.3 billion reported cash, and EUR3.6 billion of undrawn committed 
facilities. Available liquidity sources provide ample headroom to cover 
short-term financial debt, notably its EUR1.6 billion 4% notes maturing in 
August 2018, which have been repaid, but also capex and working capital 
requirements. Liquidity is also supported by access to a EUR1.5 billion 
commercial paper programme and TK's record in frequently tapping capital 
markets.

    NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Global trade
tensions have dominated recent economic news. Thursday‚Äôs
revelations of possible Chinese computer-hardware meddling and
Russian hacking of a world chemical-weapons body and
sports-doping watchdogs give justified prominence to what may be
a bigger threat to growth.
        
    Full view will be published shortly.

    CONTEXT NEWS 
    - Chinese spies placed computer chips inside equipment used
by around 30 companies, as well as multiple U.S. government
agencies, Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Oct. 4, citing 17
unnamed intelligence and company sources. That potentially gave
Beijing secret access to internal networks.
    - Apple and Amazon.com denied that their systems contained
malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese intelligence,
statements from the tech companies released separately by
Bloomberg showed.
    - The United States on Oct. 4 indicted seven Russian
intelligence officers for conspiring to hack computers and steal
data. The spies‚Äô aim was to delegitimize international
anti-doping organizations and expose officials who revealed a
Russian state-sponsored athlete doping program.
    - The UK and Dutch governments on Oct. 4 accused Russia of
running a global campaign of cyberattacks to undermine
democracies. Among these was a thwarted attempt to hack into the
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons while it
was analyzing a Russian poison used to attack a spy. EU
officials said in a statement Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúaggressive act
demonstrated contempt for the solemn purpose‚Äù of the
chemical-weapons watchdog.

    By Richard Beales
    NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Trade barriers
aren‚Äôt the only villain in town. Tensions over tariffs and pacts
like the North American Free Trade Agreement have dominated
recent economic headlines. But Thursday‚Äôs triple-whammy of news
about cyber hacking gives justified prominence to what may be an
even bigger threat to global growth and prosperity.
    Cyber crime costs the world almost $600 billion annually,
according to a report earlier this year by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies and security-software outfit
McAfee. That‚Äôs a potential hole of around 0.7 percent in global
GDP, as measured by the International Monetary Fund.
    Meanwhile, the IMF said in July that the emergence of a
trade war could dent world output by 0.5 percent by 2020. That‚Äôs
a big concern, but at under $450 billion ‚Äì simply translating
the total estimated shortfall into dollars ‚Äì not as big a one as
the annual impact of hacks and the like.
    Investors and companies are aware of both risks, ranking
trade-related factors and cyber threats among their top worries,
according to surveys by PricewaterhouseCoopers and others. Yet
tit-for-tat political rhetoric and tariffs, along with tales of
dairy farmers‚Äô personal struggles with trade barriers,
understandably get more play than drier stories about the
nefarious manipulation of invisible ones and zeros.
    It‚Äôs relatively easy, however, to grasp the implications of
Bloomberg Businessweek‚Äôs expos√© of alleged Chinese government
interference in the manufacture of cloud-storage hardware used
by American giants like Apple <AAPL.O> and Amazon.com <AMZN.O>.
It‚Äôs also possible to relate to the UK and the Netherlands going
after Moscow for trying to hack a multilateral
chemical-weapons-monitoring body ‚Äì especially after the dramatic
poisoning of a former double agent in Britain ‚Äì and the U.S.
Department of Justice indicting Russian military personnel for
cyber intrusions affecting sports-doping watchdogs.
    In a speech on Thursday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence took
aim at Beijing‚Äôs various efforts, from domestic policy to cyber
crime and propaganda, to advance its interests at the expense of
Washington‚Äôs. Of course, the United States and its allies also
participate in cyber offensives aimed the other way. With all
this publicity, though, at least investors and corporate
chieftains can‚Äôt claim they weren‚Äôt warned.

reports and events to watch which may affect Romanian financial
markets on Tuesday.
    
    WAGE DATA
    Romania's National Statistics Board to release average wage
data for August.
    
    DEBT TENDER
    Romania sold a planned 600 million lei ($147.65 million)
worth of June 2023 treasury bonds on Monday, with the average
yield at 4.75 percent, central bank data showed. [nS8N1T9006]
    
    MACRO AND RATE FORECASTS
    The median forecast of a Reuters poll of analysts puts
Romanian inflation at 4.8 percent year-on-year at the end of
September, down from August's 5.1 percent.  [nL8N1WO5PY]
    
    ANTI-CORRUPTION
    Romania's anti-graft prosecutors should focus on ""complex""
cases, not ""easy crimes"" such as abuse of office, the
government's nominee for chief prosecutor said on Monday.
    The comments by Adina Florea, a little-known magistrate
nominated for the post last month by the ruling Social Democrat
Party (PSD), will fuel concerns among the government's critics
that it is not serious about tackling graft in Romania, one of
the European Union's most corrupt states. [nL8N1WO3H3]
    
    CEE MARKETS
    The dinar touched its weakest level against the euro since
April on Monday as the Serbian central bank kept its interest
rates on hold at 3 percent, saying inflation was under control.
    [nL8N1WO3DO]
    
    RULING PARTY LEADER
    Romanian ruling Social Democrat Party leader Liviu Dragnea's
appeal against a conviction of three and half years in prison in
an abuse of office will have a next court hearing on Nov. 5.

($92 million) of treasury bills at an auction on Tuesday, in
line with its initial target, as yields remained negative, the
Finance Ministry said in a report.
    It sold 40 million euros of 18-month bills at a yield of
minus 0.37 percent against minus 0.35 percent at the last
auction of such bills in April.
    It also sold 35 million euros of 12-month bills at a yield
of minus 0.39 percent compared to minus 0.38 percent in
September. The yield for 6-month bills reached minus 0.40
percent compared to minus 0.38 percent last month.
    Analysts said yields were likely to remain negative for at
least as long as the European Central Bank continues with its
quantitative easing programme.
    Total bids amounted to 520 million euros. No further T-bill
auctions are planned this year.

    ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A downgrade of the Italian debt by
credit rating agencies is possible, a prominent lawmaker of the
ruling League party said on Wednesday, as market concern over
the financial sustainability of the government budget targets
mounted.
    The populist coalition, made up of the right-wing League
party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has set next
year's deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic output, three
times the forecast of the previous centre-left administration.
    The plan has drawn criticism from the European Commission
and has triggered a sharp rise in yields on Italian government
bonds. [nL8N1WP2A1]

    MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Fitch said on Wednesday it had
downgraded the rating of Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> to
reflect its view that there was a real possibility the bank
could fail, although the bank dismissed such a prospect and
questioned the agency's assessment.
    The rating agency said it believed it would be challenging
for the bank to strengthen its capital and said that could
ultimately lead to regulatory intervention. 
    ""Our assessment of Carige's funding continues to reflect a
franchise that remains vulnerable to creditor sentiment, which
could lead to deposit outflows, but also significant refinancing
risk,"" it said. 
    Carige said in a statement on Wednesday that regulators had
not raised the possibility of failure in talks with the bank. It
said its capital requirements, or the CET 1 ratio, was ""in line
with the requirements of the regulator.""
    The Genoa-based lender said Fitch had not taken into account
progress made at the recent shareholder meeting in terms of
governance and financial support from shareholders, adding it
reserved the right to ""evaluate Fitch's way of doing things"".
    Boardroom conflicts have thrust Italy‚Äôs last remaining large
problem bank into the spotlight, putting a question mark over a
turnaround which was starting to bear fruit.
    The European Central Bank (ECB) has given Carige until the
end of the year to close a capital shortfall, or start seeking a
merger with a stronger peer.
    Carige said in its statement that it had held a constructive
meeting with the ECB on Wednesday that had looked at future
prospects, including possible alliances.
    Fitch cut Carige ratings to 'CCC+' from 'B-'. [nFit77wQ8t]

 (Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline)
    By Gus Trompiz and Colin Packham
    PARIS/SYDNEY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures fell for a third
straight session on Thursday as an expected bumper U.S. harvest and worries over
a prolonged trade dispute between Washington and Beijing pressured prices.
    Soybeans and corn each touched a 10-day low before the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) monthly supply-and-demand outlook that is expected to again
raise estimates for U.S. harvest yields.
    Steep losses on stock markets, partly linked to investor concern over the
impact of trade tensions, also kept attention on the U.S.-China stand-off which
has led to a tailing off in U.S. soybean shipments to China. [MKTS/GLOB]
    The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade <Sv1> were
down 0.4 percent at $8.48-3/4 a bushel by 1151 GMT. It earlier slipped to $8.47,
its weakest since Oct. 1.
    ""Negative momentum remains,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural
strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 
    ""The USDA updates U.S. and global inventory estimates tonight and that will
determine whether it can be broken.""
    The USDA is expected to raise its U.S. corn and soybean yield and production
forecasts and increase its end-of-season U.S. and global stocks projections for
corn, soy and wheat. [nL2N1WO0TF]
    The prospect of bumper yields has curbed prices even in the face of
torrential rain in parts of the Midwest and U.S. Plains that is disrupting
harvesting of corn and soybeans, while also threatening to wash away some fields

Argentina's upcoming wheat harvest to 19 million tonnes from 21 million

LONDON)
    By Karen Brettell
    NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped on
Monday after retail sales data for September missed economists‚Äô
expectations, and as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields consolidated
after last week hitting their highest level in seven years.
    U.S. retail sales barely rose in September as a rebound in
motor vehicle purchases was offset by the biggest drop in
spending at restaurants and bars in nearly two years.
    Retail sales edged up only 0.1 percent in the month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.6
percent. [nLNSFLEEM8]
    ‚ÄúWe had softer than expected retail sales, that was another
leg of dollar selling,‚Äù said Win Thin, global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
    It comes after data last week showed that U.S. consumer
prices rose less than expected in September, held back by a
slower increase in the cost of rent and falling energy prices,
as underlying inflation pressures appeared to cool. [nL2N1WR0KJ]
    Higher 10-year Treasury yields, which on Tuesday shot to
2.26 percent, helped to boost the greenback last week. With
yields now having retraced to 3.15 percent, investors are
looking for fresh impetus for dollar buying.
    ‚ÄúUntil we get another leg up in U.S. yields, the dollar‚Äôs
going to be sort of in limbo,‚Äù said Thin.
    Safe haven currencies the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc
gained on Monday as European stocks tumbled to 22-month lows,
with rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia
adding to a cocktail of concerns that battered global stocks
last week. [nL8N1WV4IQ]
    Saudi Arabia has been under pressure since a prominent Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Riyadh and a U.S.
resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi
consulate in Istanbul. [nL8N1WV2J2]
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian sister party also said
on Monday it would back political stability in Berlin after
suffering big losses in a regional election which their
far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake"" that would rock the
coalition government. [nL8N1WV211]
    ""I don't think (the German election result is) a huge
political risk, but it does tell you that political risks in
Europe are not going away,"" said Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst
at Societe Generale in London.

    By Karen Brettell
    NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped on
Monday after retail sales data for September missed economists‚Äô
expectations, and as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields consolidated
after last week hitting their highest level in seven years.
    U.S. retail sales barely rose in September as a rebound in
motor vehicle purchases was offset by the biggest drop in
spending at restaurants and bars in nearly two years.
    Retail sales edged up only 0.1 percent in the month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.6
percent. [nLNSFLEEM8]
    ‚ÄúWe had softer than expected retail sales, that was another
leg of dollar selling,‚Äù said Win Thin, global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
    It comes after data last week showed that U.S. consumer
prices rose less than expected in September, held back by a
slower increase in the cost of rent and falling energy prices,
as underlying inflation pressures appeared to cool. [nL2N1WR0KJ]
    Higher 10-year Treasury yields, which on Tuesday shot to
3.26 percent, helped to boost the greenback last week. With
yields now having retraced to 3.15 percent, investors are
looking for fresh impetus for dollar buying.
    ‚ÄúUntil we get another leg up in U.S. yields, the dollar‚Äôs
going to be sort of in limbo,‚Äù said Thin.
    Safe haven currencies the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc
gained on Monday as European stocks tumbled to 22-month lows,
with rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia
adding to a cocktail of concerns that battered global stocks
last week. [nL8N1WV4IQ]
    Saudi Arabia has been under pressure since a prominent Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Riyadh and a U.S.
resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi
consulate in Istanbul. [nL8N1WV2J2]
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian sister party also said
on Monday it would back political stability in Berlin after
suffering big losses in a regional election which their
far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake"" that would rock the
coalition government. [nL8N1WV211]
    ""I don't think (the German election result is) a huge
political risk, but it does tell you that political risks in
Europe are not going away,"" said Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst
at Societe Generale in London.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 16: Fitch Ratings has downgraded Greek gaming 
groupIntralot SA's Long Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'B' from 'B+'. The 
Outlook is Negative. 

The downgrade reflects our expectation of weaker profits for 2018 and high capex 
resulting in a permanently higher leverage than in our previous rating case over 
the next four years. Operational performance is impacted by foreign exchange 
volatility and increased competitive pressure in some markets. The latter, 
together with possibly lower- or longer-than-planned return on capex could delay 
and limit the extent of deleveraging. This would increase refinancing risk and 
put pressure on the company's liquidity cushion over the next 12 to 18 months, 
which explains the Negative Outlook.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Increased Leverage: Fitch now expects funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net 
leverage to rise to around 8x in 2018 and 2019, from 6.6x in 2017. This level of 
leverage is not commensurate with a 'B' rating, hence alow financial headroom. 
However, meaningful deleveraging from 2020 could materialise through 
improvements in underlying group operating performance, and application of 
proceeds from disposals to gross debt reduction, which could moderate 
refinancing risks and help revert the rating outlook to Stable.

Unfavourable FX Drives Down EBITDA: Less than 5% of the group's EBITDA is in 
euro, and a significant share of EBITDA is derived from contracts in Turkey or 
Latin America, while debt is mostly denominated in euro. Recent FX volatility, 
in particular, in Argentina and Turkey should impact the 2018 EBITDA by around 
EUR20 million as per management guidance. This represents 12% of 2017 EBITDA. 
Although the group hedges its foreign dividend flows it is using mainly 
short-term forward contracts, which offers limited protection during period of 
prolonged FX volatility. This vulnerability is captured in the 'B' rating.

Free Cash Flow Impacted by Capex: We expect free cash flow (FCF) to be more 
negative in 2018 and 2019 than in previous years, mainly due to one-off capex 
related to the new Illinois contract and some contract renewal fees. FCF can be 
volatile as a result of upfront investments related to new contracts or contract 
renewals. However, such contracts contribute to steady operating cash flow 
generation due to their recurring profit stream. This is a key credit support. 
After 2018 the group does not have any major contract renewals until 2021 and 
therefore capex should remain lower, rebuilding some cash flow headroom.

Asset Sales Could Help Deleveraging: Our base-case projection does not factor in 
any proceeds from the expected sale of the group's 20% stake in Gamenet, which 
management would be looking to complete in the near future. These asset sale 
options provide additional flexibility for Intralot and, if implemented 
successfully, could result in significant net debt reduction, bringing net 
leverage back to levels consistent with a 'B' category rating. This could lead 
to the Outlook being revised to Stable. However, asset sales are one-off and 
subject to execution risk.

Contract Portfolio Remains Strong: Intralot has established itself in the 
international gaming sector as a reputable provider of systems to manage 
lotteries through software platforms and hardware terminals, and, in betting, a 
large algorithm-based sportsbook. This has enabled it to win important contracts 
for the supply of technology and the management of lotteries in the US and 
Greece and for sports betting in Turkey and Germany. The renewal rate of 
contacts continues to be high at 90%.

Growth Potential in Several Markets: The gradual liberalisation of gaming 
markets, governments' keenness on finding ways to raise tax proceeds and an 
increasing supply of new games should all provide increasing opportunities for 
Intralot. The group should be able to leverage on its experience and reputation 
and benefit from the limited number of reputable suppliers in the industry, 
allowing it to expand into new countries. The group is gradually reinforcing its 
presence in developed countries, and retrenching from emerging markets. It 
recently won contracts in Germany and Croatia. Intralot is also well- positioned 
to benefit from opportunities in the US or Turkey arising from the wave of 
recent changes in legislations.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

Intralot's main differentiating factor from peers is the visibility of revenue 
and EBITDA from recurring long-term contracts. Intralot has smaller revenue and 
EBITDA than GVC Holdings plc ('BB+'(EXP)/Stable), William Hill, IGT and 
Scientific Games. However, it has good geographic diversification and benefits 
from the higher growth potential of emerging markets. Compared with Net Holding 
A.S. ('B'/Stable), Intralot is larger and hasa stronger business profile with 
contracted EBITDA and specialist supplier technology expertise. The leverage of 
Intralot is, however, significantly higher than that of GVC and Net Holding.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer:

- Revenue to contract in the low single digits in 2018 due to FX volatility, 
before returning to moderate growth in 2019

- EBITDA margin declining by 230bp in 2018, before broadly stablising in 2019 
and slowly increasing thereafter

- Dividends paid to minorities broadly in line with previous years' (EUR34 
million in 2018)

- Capex higher in 2018 and 2019, mainly due to Illinois contract and other 
contract renewals

- No common dividends

In our bespoke going-concern recovery analysis we looked at Intralot's 2017 
EBITDA of EUR172 million, deducted attributable EBITDA to minority interests, 
and this was further discounted to arrive at an estimated post-restructuring 
EBITDA available to creditors of around EUR74 million. In light of increased 
volatility in future performance expectations we have discounted the EBITDA by 
30% vs. 20% in our previous calculation. We applied a distressed enterprise 
value /EBITDA multiple of 5x to Intralot's wholly-owned operations.

We also estimate EUR42 million of additional value stemming from minority 
interests.

In terms of distribution of value, all unsecured debt would recover 44% in the 
event of default (assuming Intralot's unsecured revolving credit facility will 
be fully drawn). This is consistent with an 'RR4' Recovery Rating and an 
instrument rating of 'B', i.e. the same rating as the IDR compared with one 
notch higher in our previous analysis, as a result of the higher EBITDA 
discount.

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action (i.e. Outlook being revised to Stable)

-EBITDA growth derived from a stronger return on capital on existing and future 
contracts, and efficient management of FX risks, leading to FFO margin of around 
5% on a sustained basis

- FFO-based adjusted net leverage trending towards 5.5 x (FFO lease adjusted 
gross leverage trending towards 6.0x), with cash deposited predominantly at 
investment grade-rated counterparties

- FFO fixed charge cover above 2.2x on a sustained basis (2017: 2.5x)

- Evidence of sustained neutral-to-positive FCF generation, reflecting 
sustainable capex investments

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- Evidence that new contracts or renewals are occurring at materially less 
favourable conditions for Intralot, resulting in continuing weak FFO margin 
staying under 4%, large upfront concession fees or capex outlays , or EBITDA 
impacted by persisting unfavourable FX rates

- FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably above 6.5x (or FFO adjusted gross 
leverage above 7x)

- FFO fixed charge cover below 1.8x

- FCF remaining negative erodingliquidity, leading to increased reliance on 
external sources of financing or asset sales

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

At end-2017, Intralot had EUR208 million of cash on balance sheet, of which 
EUR80.7 million was with partners, which we view as unrestricted (as we deem 
EUR30 million not available for debt service due to working capital 
requirements). Of this cash about 5.5% is deposited in Greek banks, and 80% is 
in euro or US dollar. This is sufficient as Intralot does not face any 
significant debt maturities until 2021, when the first bond (with a face value 
of EUR250 million) matures, while the second bond (with a face value of EUR500 
million) matures in 2024. At end June 2018 Intralot also had undrawn revolving 
credit facilities of EUR80 million.

In September 2017, Intralot issued a EUR500 million senior unsecured bond paying 
a fixed coupon of 5.25%. The proceeds allowed it to repay other shorter-dated 
and more expensive notes. This extended the maturity profile of Intralot, and 
reduced its cost of debt.

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS 

We deduct the estimated amount of recurring dividends paid to / dividends 
received from minorities of EUR36 million (2017) from our calculation of FFO.

Although operating leases are modest, Fitch has adjusted the debt by adding 8x 
of annual operating lease expense related to long term assets.

We use the nominal value rather than the reported value of debt. The adjustment 
is EUR12 million.

    * Nordea says aware of allegatioms, works closely with
authorities

    By Johan Ahlander
    STOCKHOLM, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Sweden's Economic Crime
Authority said on Tuesday it had received documents from
Hermitage Capital Management purporting to show that Nordic bank
Nordea <NDAFI.HE> <NDA.ST> had breached its responsibilities
under anti-money laundering laws.
    ""We have received documents from Hermitage regarding
money-laundering and we're evaluating which authority should
handle this,"" a spokesman for the body told Reuters. 
    He said a formal investigation had not been opened yet.
    Nordea said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it was
aware of the report.
    ""We work closely with the relevant authorities in the
countries in which we operate, including the Nordic Financial
Intelligence Units,"" Nordea said.
    ""In any cases where we deem it to be suspicious
transactions, we report it to the authorities for them to take
forward.""
    It declined to comment on individual clients, citing banking
secrecy rules.
    The Economic Crime Authority declined to give further
details. Hermitage declined to comment.
    In 2015, Nordea was fined 50 million Swedish crowns ($5.62
million) by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for
breaches in anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism
rules. That was the maximum fine at the time.  
    It is the second Nordic bank to be hit by allegations of
breaches in internal controls against money laundering in recent
months.
    Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> has been at the centre of an
investigation into alleged money laundering which has prompted a
U.S. criminal investigation. [nL8N1W51FB][nL8N1WL1G7]
    The Danske scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion)
in transactions processed by Denmark's biggest bank via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank
said last month it thinks are suspicious.
    Bill Browder, the founder and CEO of investment fund
Hermitage Capital Management, filed a criminal complaint with
Danish authorities in July over alleged money laundering at
Danske Bank's Estonian branch in the past. [nL8N1U853V]
[nL5N1UL1ZO]
    The American-born Briton later filed a new criminal
complaint in Estonia concerning Danske Bank.
    Browder, once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia,
is now campaigning to expose corruption.

    By Saikat Chatterjee
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The dollar rose for a second
consecutive day on Wednesday as firmer stock markets fuelled
demand for the greenback, though the release of U.S. Federal
Reserve minutes later in the day kept gains in check.
    The British pound was the biggest loser against the dollar,
with lower than expected UK inflation data weighing on sterling.
    ""The dollar is trapped in a sideways range and we need more
confirmation on the data front to push it higher from these
levels,"" said Bernd Berg, a global macro and foreign exchange
strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Switzerland.
    Against a basket of its rivals <=USD><.DXY>, the dollar rose
a quarter of a percent but it remains about 2 percent below its
mid-August peak.
    However, moves were broadly muted in currency markets, in
contrast to big gains in global stocks and drops in government
bond yields in markets such as Italy.
    Markets will be looking for clues on the dollar's direction
and the path for U.S. interest rates from minutes of the Fed's
September meeting, due for release later on Wednesday.
    Interest rate futures are pricing in a 77 percent likelihood
that the Fed will raise rates in December, according to the CME
Group's FedWatch Tool. Two more increases are likely next year. 
  
    Sterling fell by nearly half a percent after consumer price
data for September came in at an annual rate of 2.4 percent
versus forecasts of 2.6 percent. [nL8N1WX25A]
    Forecast-beating U.S. company earnings improved the mood on
world equity markets as Asian and European shares put aside
concerns over global growth and trade and took their cue from
Wall Street's best one-day rise in eight months. [nL3N1WX2F9]
    ""The dollar has been strongly correlated to risk appetite
for much of this year, but in the last few days we have seen
this correlation loosening a bit, suggesting markets need more
strong economic data to push the dollar higher,"" said Manuel
Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.
    However, some market analysts warned against buying into the
dollar's strength, saying financial conditions appeared to be
tightening globally.
    Cross-currency basis swaps in euros, yen and sterling --
money market gauges of offshore dollar liquidity -- have widened
in recent weeks, suggesting that the Fed's rate hikes have cut
into the availability of overseas dollars.
    ""Risk caution is warranted ... the replacement of Fed
liquidity has come at the expense of tightening liquidity
conditions outside the U.S.,"" Morgan Stanley strategists said. 
    On Wednesday the euro <EUR=EBS> traded a quarter of a
percent lower at $1.1542, down 0.2 percent. On Tuesday it
reached $1.1622 - its highest since Oct. 1 - before giving up
gains.

Wednesday that there was sufficient evidence so far to suggest
that the Syrian man who took a woman hostage in Cologne on
Monday had a radical Islamist motive.
    The chief federal prosecutor said this was partly based on
statements from witnesses, who said the man had said he was a
member of Islamic State and wanted to travel to the group in
Syria.
    The man had demanded via telephone to be allowed to travel
to IS in Syria, the prosecutor said.

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on
Wednesday there was evidence the Syrian man who took a woman
hostage in Cologne on Monday had a radical Islamist motive.
    The chief federal prosecutor said witnesses reported that
the man, identified only as Mohammad A.R., had said he was a
member of Islamic State and wanted to travel to join the group
in Syria. 
    He had made demands by phone to be allowed to travel to
Islamic State in Syria, the prosecutor said in a statement.
    ""Based on the knowledge we have now, there are sufficient
indications that there was a radical Islamist background to the
act,"" it said.
    Police said on Tuesday the suspect was in a coma after being
shot several times but his life was not in danger. [nL8N1WW5DM]
    The suspect poured a flammable liquid on the floor of a fast
food restaurant and lit it, and a 14-year-old trying to escape
the flames fell and suffered burns, the prosecutor said.
    The suspect is charged with attempted murder and causing
grievous bodily harm.
    Prosecutors said they were investigating whether the suspect
had carried out the attack on behalf of IS or another terrorist
organisation and whether there were accomplices.

    By Karen Brettell
    NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained on
Wednesday as stocks dipped, boosting demand for safe haven
currencies, and before the Federal Reserve is due to release the
minutes from its September meeting.
    Stocks weakened a day after Wall Street's strongest rally in
seven months as investors were disappointed with IBM's results
and cautious ahead of the Fed minutes. [nL3N1WX488]
    ‚ÄúThe market once again is in a nervous mode, which is
supporting safe haven currencies like the dollar,‚Äù said Joe
Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business
Solutions in Washington.
    The dollar index <.DXY> gained 0.32 percent to 95.355, but
held in the relatively tight range it has traded in for the past
week.
    ""The dollar is trapped in a sideways range and we need more
confirmation on the data front to push it higher from these
levels,"" said Bernd Berg, a global macro and foreign exchange
strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Switzerland.
    Investors are focused on the Fed's meeting minutes for
further clues over how many further rate increases are likely.
    ‚ÄúIf they signal full speed ahead for a December rate hike

dollar biased higher,‚Äù said Manimbo.
    Interest rate futures are pricing in a 77 percent likelihood

    By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral
    Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean and corn futures eased on Thursday, as
investors expected drier weather to let harvesting pick up in the U.S. Midwest
after heavy rain in recent weeks.
    Wheat ticked higher after losing 1 percent in the previous session, with
traders waiting for weekly U.S. export data later in the day for a fresh
indication of overseas demand. [nL2N1WX0U5]
    The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade <Sv1> fell
0.9 percent to $8.78-1/4 a bushel by 1200 GMT.
    Soybeans on Monday rose to their highest since Aug. 21 at $8.92 after rains
delayed the harvest in key parts of the U.S. Midwest.
    CBOT corn <Cv1> lost 0.5 percent to $3.72-1/2 a bushel, while wheat <Wv1>
edged up 0.1 percent to $5.18-1/4 a bushel.
    ""Soybean harvest is expected to gather pace as dry weather returns to the
U.S. Midwest, it will keep prices under pressure,"" said Phin Ziebell,
agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank.
    A swift start to soybean planting in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of
the oilseed, was also keeping a lid on soybean prices. [nL8N1WV4MM]
    However, the recent downpours and a downward revision to the government's
corn and soybean yield forecasts have created doubt about the size of what has
been expected to be a bumper harvest. 
    The potential for more rain in the next 6-10 days in the Midwest would have
to be closely monitored, Thomson Reuters Agriculture Research analysts said in a
note.
    Traders were also waiting for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA)
weekly export sales report to assess to what extent a drop in demand from China,
which is locked in a trade dispute with Washington, was being offset by
shipments to other countries.
    The figures will also give a pointer as to whether U.S. wheat exports are
starting to pick up after a modest start to the season.
    U.S. wheat exports look set for a strong second half to the 2018/19 season
when shipments from Russia are expected to slow, the chairman of the USDA's
World Agricultural Outlook Board said on Tuesday.

 (Recasts with rise in Hungarian bond yields, Romanian bond
auction, stocks and currencies)
    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian government bond
yields reversed their earlier decline on Thursday, tracking a
renewed increase in U.S. Treasury yields after the Federal
Reserve's minutes signalled more increases in interest rates.
    Hungary's 10-year yield <HU10YT=RR> rose 3 basis points from
early trade to 3.76 percent. Poland's corresponding yield
<PL10YT=RR> first rose 2 basis points, then returned to
Wednesday's close of 3.19 percent.
    The Hungarian yield is still down by about 15 basis points
from Tuesday's peak.
    Its retreat was caused by a return of buyers after a rally
of about 40 basis points earlier this month, when U.S. yields
were also rising.
    Hungarian long-term government debt is particularly
vulnerable because of inflation worries, coupled with the lowest
short-term interest rates in the eastern European Union, market
participants said.
    Upwards pressure on long-term Hungarian yields is likely to
return in the coming months. During periods of calm in developed
markets, investors could find the yields attractively high, said
Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at Raiffeisen. 
    ""The 4 percent level could be approached again later this
year, and that could trigger inflows from abroad,"" he said.
    In neighbouring Romania, a rise in inflation to above 5
percent by the middle of this year has also boosted government
bond yields. 
    As inflation is expected to retreat in coming months, 3-year
Romanian bonds offered at an auction on Thursday attracted
healthy demand.
    The finance ministry sold bonds worth 888.4 million lei
($219.52 million), compared with its 500 million lei original
plan, at an average yield of 4.5 percent, up from 4.19 percent
at a tender held seven weeks ago. 
    ""(Romanian government bonds) come out good on our real yield
measures in the short to medium term,"" Raiffeisen analyst
Stephan Imre said in a note.
    ""We nevertheless reiterate looming fiscal risks that should
finally increase the pressure on the central bank to recommence
rate hikes in 2019,"" he added.
    While Central Europe's high-yielding bonds remained
attractive, a rebound in equities in the region lost steam as 
their Asian and Western European peers were pushed lower by
expectations for a continuing rise in Fed interest rates.
    While the main stock indices if Budapest <.BUX> and Prague
<.PX> were steady at 1301 GMT, Warsaw <.WIG20> shed 0.2 percent
and Bucharest <BETI> eased half a percent.
    The region's main currencies eased 0.1-0.2 percent against
the euro, led by Poland's zloty <EURPLN=> which traded at
4.2976.

 (Releads with Trump comments in Nevada)
    By Jeff Mason
    ELKO, Nev., Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
said on Saturday he is not satisfied with Saudi Arabia's
handling of the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul,
and said questions remain unanswered.
    Saudi Arabia said early on Saturday that Khashoggi, a critic
of the country's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, had died in a fight inside its consulate in the Turkish
city.     
    Riyadh provided no evidence to support its account, which
marked a reversal of an initial statement that Khashoggi had
left the consulate the same day he entered on Oct. 2 to get
documents for his upcoming marriage.
    Asked during a trip to Nevada if he was satisfied that Saudi
officials had been fired over Khashoggi's death, Trump said:
""No, I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a
big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to
the answer.""    
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a Washington Post
columnist, was killed inside the consulate by a team of Saudi
agents and his body cut up.
    Trump said it was possible that Prince Mohammed had been
unaware of the circumstances around the death of Khashoggi, a
Saudi national and U.S. resident.
    Trump said no one seems to know where the journalist‚Äôs body
is, adding that no one from his administration has seen video or
a transcript of what happened inside the consulate.   
    While Middle Eastern allies closed ranks around the kingdom,
Western reaction to the Saudi narrative varied. Trump had
initially said it was credible.     
    Germany and France on Saturday called Saudi Arabia's
explanation of how Khashoggi died incomplete.

    By Marwa Rashad
    RIYADH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - As Saudi Arabia faced
intensifying international scepticism over its story about the
death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a senior
government official laid out a new version of the death inside
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that in key respects contradicts
previous explanations.
    The latest account, provided by a Saudi official who
requested anonymity, includes details on how the team of 15
Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi on Oct. 2 had
threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed
him in a chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team then
dressed in Khashoggi's clothes to make it appear as if he had
left the consulate.
    After denying any involvement in the disappearance of
Khashoggi, 59, for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on Saturday morning
said he had died in a fistfight at the consulate. An hour later,
another Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold,
which the senior official reiterated.
    Turkish officials suspect the body of Khashoggi, a
Washington Post columnist and critic of powerful Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman, was cut up but the Saudi official said it
was rolled up in a rug and given to a ""local cooperator"" for
disposal. Asked about allegations that Khashoggi had been
tortured and beheaded, he said preliminary results of the
investigation did not suggest that.
    The Saudi official presented what he said were Saudi
internal intelligence documents which appeared to show the
initiative to bring back dissidents as well as the specific one
involving Khashoggi. He also showed testimony from those
involved in what he described as the 15-man team's cover-up, and
the initial results of an internal probe. He did not provide
proof to substantiate the findings of the investigation and the
other evidence.
    This narrative is the latest Saudi account that has changed
multiple times. The authorities initially dismissed reports that
Khashoggi had gone missing inside the consulate as false and
said he had left the building soon after entering. When the
media reported a few days later that he had been killed there,
they called the accusations ""baseless.""
    Asked by Reuters why the government's version of Khashoggi's
death kept changing, the official said the government initial
account was based on ""false information reported internally at
the time.""
    ""Once it became clear these initial mission reports were
false, it launched an internal investigation and refrained from
further public comment,"" the official said, adding that the
investigation is continuing.
    Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording
purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate
but have not released it.
    Riyadh dispatched a high-level delegation to Istanbul on
Tuesday and ordered an internal investigation but U.S. President
Donald Trump said on Saturday he is not satisfied with Saudi
Arabia‚Äôs handling of Khashoggi's death and said questions remain
unanswered. Germany and France on Saturday called Saudi Arabia‚Äôs
explanation of how Khashoggi died incomplete.
    According to the latest version of the death, the government
wanted to convince Khashoggi, who moved to Washington a year ago
fearing reprisals for his views, to return to the kingdom as
part of a campaign to prevent Saudi dissidents from being
recruited by the country's enemies, the official said.
    To that end, the official said, the deputy head of the
General Intelligence Presidency, Ahmed al-Asiri, put together a
15-member team from the intelligence and security forces to go
to Istanbul, meet Khashoggi at the consulate and try to convince
him to return to Saudi Arabia.
    ‚ÄúThere is a standing order to negotiate the return of
dissidents peacefully; which gives them the authority to act
without going back to the leadership"" the official said.
    ""Asiri is the one who formed the team and asked for an
employee who worked with (Saud) al-Qahtani and who knew Jamal
from the time they both worked at the embassy in London,‚Äù he
said.
    The official said Qahtani had signed off on one of his
employees conducting the negotiations.
   
    CHOKEHOLD
    According to the plan, the team could hold Khashoggi in a
safe house outside Istanbul for ""a period of time"" but then
release him if he ultimately refused to return to Saudi Arabia,
the official said.
    Things went wrong from the start as the team overstepped
their orders and quickly employed violence, the official said.
    Khashoggi was ushered into the consul general's office where
an operative named Maher Mutreb spoke to him about returning to
Saudi Arabia, according to the government's account.
    Khashoggi refused and told Mutreb that someone was waiting
outside for him and would contact the Turkish authorities if he
did not reappear within an hour, the official said.
    Khashoggi's fianc√©e, Hatice Cengiz, has told Reuters he had
handed her his two mobile phones and left instructions that she
should wait for him and call an aide to Turkey's president if he
did not reappear.
    Back inside the consul's office, according to the official's
account, Khashoggi told Mutreb he was violating diplomatic norms
and said, ""What are you going to do with me? Do you intend to
kidnap me?""
    Mutreb replied, ""Yes, we will drug you and kidnap you,"" in
what the official said was an attempt at intimidation that
violated the mission's objective.
    When Khashoggi raised his voice, the team panicked. They
moved to restrain him, placing him in a chokehold and covering
his mouth, according to the government's account.
    ""They tried to prevent him from shouting but he died,"" the
official said. ‚ÄúThe intention was not to kill him.""
    Asked if the team had smothered Khashoggi, the official
said: ""If you put someone of Jamal‚Äôs age in this position, he
would probably die.""
   
    MISSING BODY
    To cover up their misdeed, the team rolled up Khashoggi's
body in a rug, took it out in a consular vehicle and handed it
over to a ""local cooperator"" for disposal, the official said.
Forensic expert Salah Tubaigy tried to remove any trace of the
incident, the official said.
    Turkish officials have told Reuters that Khashoggi's killers
may have dumped his remains in Belgrad Forest adjacent to
Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of Yalova, 90
kilometers (55 miles) south of Istanbul.
    Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened
to the body ""before long,"" a senior official said. [nL8N1X00CN]
    The Saudi official said the local cooperator is an Istanbul
resident but would not reveal his nationality. The official said
investigators were trying to determine where the body ended up.
    Meanwhile, operative Mustafa Madani donned Khashoggi's
clothes, eyeglasses and Apple watch and left through the back
door of the consulate in an attempt to make it look like
Khashoggi had walked out of the building. Madani went to the
Sultanahmet district where he disposed of the belongings.
    The official said the team then wrote a false report for
superiors saying they had allowed Khashoggi to leave once he
warned that Turkish authorities could get involved and that they
had promptly left the country before they could be discovered.
    Sceptics have asked why so many people, including military
officers and a forensics expert specializing in autopsies, were
part of the operation if the objective was to convince Khashoggi
to return home of his own volition.
    The disappearance of Khashoggi, a Saudi insider turned
critic, has snowballed into a massive crisis for the kingdom,
forcing the 82-year-old monarch, King Salman, to personally get
involved. It has threatened the kingdom‚Äôs business
relationships, with several senior executives and government
officials shunning an investor conference in Riyadh scheduled
for next week and some U.S. lawmakers putting pressure on Trump
to impose sanctions and stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
    The official said all 15 team members had been detained and
placed under investigation, along with three other local
suspects.

    By Marwa Rashad
    RIYADH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - As Saudi Arabia faced
intensifying international scepticism over its story about the
death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a senior
government official laid out a new version of the death inside
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that in key respects contradicts
previous explanations.
    The latest account, provided by a Saudi official who
requested anonymity, includes details on how the team of 15
Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi on Oct. 2 had
threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed
him in a chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team then
dressed in Khashoggi's clothes to make it appear as if he had
left the consulate.
    After denying any involvement in the disappearance of
Khashoggi, 59, for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on Saturday morning
said he had died in a fistfight at the consulate. An hour later,
another Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold,
which the senior official reiterated.
    Turkish officials suspect the body of Khashoggi, a
Washington Post columnist and critic of powerful Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman, was cut up but the Saudi official said it
was rolled up in a rug and given to a ""local cooperator"" for
disposal. Asked about allegations that Khashoggi had been
tortured and beheaded, he said preliminary results of the
investigation did not suggest that.
    The Saudi official presented what he said were internal
Saudi intelligence documents which appeared to describe an
initiative to bring dissidents home to Saudi Arabia, including
the specific one involving Khashoggi. He also showed testimony
from those involved in what he described as the 15-man team's
cover-up, and the initial results of an internal probe. He did
not provide proof to substantiate the findings of the
investigation and the other evidence.
    This narrative is the latest Saudi account that has changed
multiple times. The authorities initially dismissed reports that
Khashoggi had gone missing inside the consulate as false and
said he had left the building soon after entering. When the
media reported a few days later that he had been killed there,
they called the accusations ""baseless.""

    MORNING CALL: NOT MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO (0522 GMT) 
    Financial spreadbetters expect European stock markets to open in negative territory and why
wouldn't they? Asian markets are closing deep into negative territory after the S&P and the Dow
also ended lower.
    It's fair to say that the earnings season hasn't fully reassured investors who are facing a
toxic cocktail of negative drivers, from Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to concerns over
Italy's budget and Brexit talks.
    At the moment we have London's FTSE at 40 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 108 points and
Paris' CAC to lose 31 points lower at 5,022.

retirement age contained in Italy's 2019 budget is a permanent
measure, not a one-off, an Italian Treasury source said on
Tuesday.
    The budget rolls back a 2011 pension reform that sharply
raised the retirement age, and gives people the option of
retiring at 62 years of age if they have paid 38 years of
pension contributions.
    Ratings agency Moody's, which downgraded Italy's sovereign
debt on Friday while leaving the future outlook stable, said in
its report that the early retirement option was ""ostensibly a
one-off measure, available next year only"".
    This gave rise to some confusion, but the Treasury source
told Reuters the measure was clear. ""It's a structural measure,
not one-off,"" the source said.

 (Adds comment from Porsche Automobil Holding SE and the
Stuttgart court)
    FRANKFURT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - A German court on Wednesday
ordered Porsche Automobil Holding SE <PSHG_p.DE> to pay
shareholders 47.2 million euros ($53.8 million) in compensation
for violating disclosure rules over an emissions scandal at its
main investment Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>.
    Shareholders who held Porsche SE stock between May 23, 2014,
and Sept. 22, 2015, were entitled to be compensated for the
share price declines caused by Volkswagen's (VW) cheating of
U.S. diesel emissions tests, the Stuttgart court said. 
    Porsche SE, which holds a 30.8 percent stake in VW and 52
percent of voting rights at the carmaker, said it would appeal
the ruling and that it was confident a higher court would
overturn the lower court's findings.
    ""Porsche SE is convinced that the lawsuits are without
merit,"" it said. 
    Porsche SE shareholders sued the company for failing to
inform its investors in a timely manner about VW's diesel
emissions cheating, which has cost the automaker more than 27
billion euros in fines and vehicle refits. 
    At the time U.S. regulators caught VW using illegal software
to rig diesel engine tests, the carmaker was headed by Martin
Winterkorn, who was also CEO of Porsche SE.
    Law firm Nieding & Barth said the pension fund for the city
of Wolverhampton in central England was awarded 3.2 million
euros in damages by the Stuttgart court.
    Law firm TILP said Porsche SE was asked to pay 44 million
euros to other shareholders.
    The verdict is not enforceable yet, given Porsche SE's right
to appeal, TILP said.
    VW is also being sued by investors for allegedly breaching
disclosure violations, which the company denies.

 (Updates with closing prices, recasts)
    By Peter Hobson
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Industrial metals prices fell on
Wednesday, pushed lower by a stronger dollar and losses on
global stock markets that reflected a lack of appetite for risky
assets, though zinc touched a three-week high in earlier
trading.
    Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange (LME) <CMZN3>
closed down 0.2 percent at $2,663 a tonne after reaching $6,721,
its highest since Oct. 2.
    The metal used to galvanise steel has outperformed other
industrial metals since hitting a 22-month low in August. It is
up 16.5 percent since then. 
    ""The driver is tightness in the market,"" said Societe
Generale analyst Robin Bhar, pointing to a large supply deficit,
elevated prices for cash metal and falling exchange stockpiles. 
    ""Although we are getting new mine supply, we don't see the
refined market balancing for a few more years."" 
    
    GLOBAL MARKETS: A cocktail of disappointing earnings,
economic growth concerns, a spat between Italy and the European
Union and the killing of a Saudi journalist were making
investors nervous. [MKTS/GLOB]
    DOLLAR: The dollar surged to its strongest since mid-August,
pressuring metals by making them more expensive for buyers with
other currencies. <.DXY> [FRX/]
    ZINC STOCKS: On-warrant zinc stocks in LME-registered
warehouses -- metal available to the market -- have fallen below
100,000 tonnes from almost 240,000 tonnes in August and are
close to 10-year lows. <MZNSTX-TOTAL>
    SPREAD: The premium for cash zinc over the three-month LME
contract, at $47, remains close to Monday's $63 one-year high,
signalling tight nearby supply. <MZN0-3> 
    TECHNICALS: ""The technical picture (for zinc) is brightening
after the price appears to have successfully exceeded the
100-day moving average, encouraging further buyers to jump on
the bandwagon,"" Commerzbank analysts said.
    DEFICIT: The global zinc market had a deficit of 292,000
tonnes in the first eight months of the year, the International
Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) said. In August the deficit
was 76,200 tonnes. [nL8N1X44VI]
    CHINA STIMULUS: China, the largest consumer of metals, more
than quadrupled the value of fixed-asset investment projects
approved in the third quarter from the April-June period, as
part of efforts to prop up the slowing economy. [nL3N1X438S]
    ANTOFAGASTA: Chile's Antofagasta <ANTO.L> revised its
full-year copper production guidance to 705,000-725,000 tonnes
from 705,000-740,000 tonnes. [nL3N1X42JP]
    NORSK HYDRO: The CEO of Norway's Norsk Hydro said he expects
 a deficit in the aluminium market next year and is uncertain
when an alumina plant in Brazil would resume full production.

    PRICES: LME copper <CMCU3> ended down 0.3 percent at $6,179
a tonne, aluminium <CMAL3> finished 0.2 percent lower at $1,998,
lead <CMPB3> lost 0.6 percent to $2,005, nickel <CMNI3> slipped

    * All six LME industrial metals fall
    * Zinc touches 3-week high on supply fears
    * Zinc deficit grows to 76,200 tonnes in August-ILZSG

    By Peter Hobson
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Industrial metals prices fell on
Wednesday, pushed lower by a stronger dollar and losses on
global stock markets that reflected a lack of appetite for risky
assets, though zinc touched a three-week high in earlier
trading.
    Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange (LME) <CMZN3>
closed down 0.2 percent at $2,663 a tonne after reaching its
highest since Oct. 2.
    The metal used to galvanise steel has outperformed other
industrial metals since hitting a 22-month low in August. It is
up 16.5 percent since then. 
    ""The driver is tightness in the market,"" said Societe
Generale analyst Robin Bhar, pointing to a large supply deficit,
elevated prices for cash metal and falling exchange stockpiles. 
    ""Although we are getting new mine supply, we don't see the
refined market balancing for a few more years."" 
    
    GLOBAL MARKETS: A cocktail of disappointing earnings,
economic growth concerns, a spat between Italy and the European
Union and the killing of a Saudi journalist were making
investors nervous. [MKTS/GLOB]
    DOLLAR: The dollar surged to its strongest since mid-August,
pressuring metals by making them more expensive for buyers with
other currencies. <.DXY> [FRX/]
    ZINC STOCKS: On-warrant zinc stocks in LME-registered
warehouses -- metal available to the market -- have fallen below
100,000 tonnes from almost 240,000 tonnes in August and are
close to 10-year lows. <MZNSTX-TOTAL>
    SPREAD: The premium for cash zinc over the three-month LME
contract, at $47, remains close to Monday's $63 one-year high,
signalling tight nearby supply. <MZN0-3> 
    TECHNICALS: ""The technical picture (for zinc) is brightening
after the price appears to have successfully exceeded the
100-day moving average, encouraging further buyers to jump on
the bandwagon,"" Commerzbank analysts said.
    DEFICIT: The global zinc market had a deficit of 292,000
tonnes in the first eight months of the year, the International
Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) said. In August the deficit
was 76,200 tonnes. [nL8N1X44VI]
    CHINA STIMULUS: China, the largest consumer of metals, more
than quadrupled the value of fixed-asset investment projects
approved in the third quarter from the April-June period, as
part of efforts to prop up the slowing economy. [nL3N1X438S]
    ANTOFAGASTA: Chile's Antofagasta <ANTO.L> revised its
full-year copper production guidance to 705,000-725,000 tonnes
from 705,000-740,000 tonnes. [nL3N1X42JP]
    NORSK HYDRO: The CEO of Norway's Norsk Hydro said he expects
 a deficit in the aluminium market next year and is uncertain
when an alumina plant in Brazil would resume full production.
[nL8N1X32JG]
    PRICES: LME copper <CMCU3> ended down 0.3 percent at $6,179
a tonne, aluminium <CMAL3> finished 0.2 percent lower at $1,998,
lead <CMPB3> lost 0.6 percent to $2,005, nickel <CMNI3> slipped
1.2 percent to $12,225 and tin <CMSN3> closed 0.1 percent down
at $19,275.

    BUCHAREST, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Romania's justice minister on
Wednesday demanded the prosecutor general's dismissal, accusing
him of exceeding his authority in a move that could heighten
concerns in Brussels about democratic values in some eastern EU
member states.
    Other recent steps by Romania's ruling Social Democrats to
change the justice system and replace senior judicial officials
have triggered massive street protests, and sparked worries
about the rule of law at the European Commission and among
diplomats.
    Justice Minister Tudorel Toader read a summary of a 20-point
report that he had compiled, calling for Prosecutor General
Augustin Lazar to be fired on the grounds that he was
responsible for ""acts and facts intolerable to the rule of law.""
    Lazar is the last major figure in an anti-corruption drive
that has won praise from Brussels for exposing high-level
corruption, including the theft of EU funds. [nL8N1WZ6DD] 
    He condemned Toader's bid to oust him. ""(This) is the way
that the executive, by way of the justice minister, demonstrates
its understanding about respect for prosecutors' independence,""
he told reporters.
    Lazar oversees thousands of prosecutors, including
anti-organised crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA. 
    The DIICOT leader's mandate has expired, and the head of the
DNA, Laura Codruta Kovesi, was fired in July after a performance
review similar to Lazar's. Critics say their potential
replacements might be soft on crime.
    Under Romanian law, the president must sign off on petitions
to dismiss chief prosecutors, which are requested by the justice
minister and also need approval from a judicial watchdog.
    However, the Constitutional Court ruled earlier this year
that the president does not have the right to oppose such a
request from the justice minister. As a result, President Klaus
Iohannis had to sack the DNA's Kovesi in July. [nL5N1T14PC] 
    Iohannis will be limited to assessing the legality of the
procedure. Analysts have said the constitutional court's ruling
increased the government's power over prosecutors.
    Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's
most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system
under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.
    Anti-corruption prosecutors have convicted thousands of
public officials, including lawmakers and ministers. 
    Among them is Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea who has a
two-year suspended jail sentence in a vote-rigging case. He was
also sentenced to three and a half years in jail in a separate
abuse of office case. He denies all charges and has appealed.
    The European Commission, which is already seeking sanctions
against Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic values, fears
Romania is following suit. It is due to release its latest
justice monitoring report on Romania in November.

    By Rob Cox
    DOHA, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - An influential Saudi
Arabian prince once called Qatar, a spit of sand sticking into
the Persian Gulf like a thumb, nothing more than ‚Äú300 people and
a television channel.‚Äù Such disdain inspired Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman to initiate a four-nation blockade of the
country. But not a year and a half later, the young Saudi
monarch has acknowledged what has become apparent to the world:
Qatar is doing just fine. 
    It would be easy for this tiny-but-rich nation of 2.6
million people to gloat over the global public display of
revulsion surrounding the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi
by Saudi agents. Yet ‚ÄúSaudenfreude,‚Äù or satisfaction over
condemnation of its neighbour‚Äôs alleged drawing-and-quartering
of a prominent dissident in its Istanbul consulate, is in short
supply in Doha.
    That‚Äôs not because Qatar is especially humble. Emir Sheikh
Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani‚Äôs visage is more ubiquitous in the
capital than those of his counterparts in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.
His silhouette adorns everything from skyscrapers to taxis. And
Qatar has never been shy about flaunting its good fortune,
embarking on flashy shopping sprees and acquiring trophy assets
like Harrods and French soccer club, Paris Saint-Germain.
    But taking an uncharacteristically quiet high road is now
Qatar‚Äôs best bet for handling the Saudi crisis. And with good
reason: a closed border with its neighbour to the south is
better than chaos on the other side, especially if it leads to
unrest over absolute monarchies in the region. Either through
internal checks or U.S. and European sanctions, the best outcome
for Qatar is a chastened crown prince - not a deposed one - who
is more acutely aware of the limits of his power. 
    It doesn‚Äôt take long in Doha to see the embargo by Saudi,
the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt has been something
of an economic blessing. After an initial shock, when some $30
billion of bank deposits from those countries were repatriated
and shipments of foodstuffs, like milk dried up, Qatar quickly
reoriented supply chains and funding sources in ways that may
ultimately benefit it for years to come. Even MbS gets that,
praising Qatar‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat economy‚Äù in remarks at his Future
Investment Initiative on Wednesday.
    In what has become a symbol of Qatar‚Äôs resilience, the
country used its considerable wealth - which includes some $44
billion of reserves and a $300 billion sovereign fund - to ship
in 17,000 cows and an Irish farmer to become self-sufficient in
dairy. Iranian and Turkish produce is prominent on the shelves
of the downtown Doha Carrefour <CARR.PA>.
    Raw materials like bitumen, once purchased through resellers
in Dubai, now arrive directly, and at a lower cost, says one
government official. The embargo accelerated the expansion of
Hamad Port, a key infrastructural component of the Qatar
National Vision 2030, the country‚Äôs plan to prepare for when
energy demand slows. Since the embargo cut off key shipping
routes in the region, Hamad has forged new ones with Malaysia,
China, India and Greece.
    Though Qataris don‚Äôt want to say it on the record, there is
consistent pride in successfully weathering a Saudi-induced
‚Äústress test‚Äù. There is also near-universal relief that it
occurred before the eyes of the world are focused on Qatar‚Äôs
hosting of soccer‚Äôs World Cup in 2022, a first for an Arab
nation. ‚ÄúThe blockade has been a tragedy for many families who
have been separated - and for cooperation in the Gulf,‚Äù says one
senior official. ‚ÄúBut we have to proceed as if the blockade is
permanent ‚Äì that it‚Äôs the new normal‚Äù.
    The boycott began in June 2017, not long after U.S.
President Donald Trump visited the region and met MbS and his
father King Salman bin Abdulaziz, as well as Sheikh Tamim. It
came as a complete surprise in Doha. Not even the national
airline had any inkling it would be barred from flying to Dubai,
Riyadh, Cairo and other key destinations, or that its planes
would be forced to circumvent the airspace of the embargoing
nations.
    Yet even the airline is moving ahead. True, it lost $69
million in the year ended in March as 18 routes, and around 20
percent of its passengers, disappeared. Since then, it has added
24 new routes, and its chief says it may be facing a shortage of
aircraft as it gears up for the World Cup.
    For Qataris with relatives in the region ‚Äì about 15,000
families and thousands more non-resident workers - the pain is
acute. Qatar didn‚Äôt reciprocate. In fact, the country relaxed
some visa restrictions after the blockade. But getting to Doha
requires a stop in Kuwait or Oman even for those allowed to
enter. The closure of the Saudi embassy also makes it virtually
impossible for Muslims in Qatar to arrange visits to the holy
sites of Mecca and Medina.
    Notwithstanding these difficulties, Qatar‚Äôs economy is
humming. Higher energy prices have been a boon for the gas
business that powers more than a third of GDP. Qatar has proven
reserves of around 173 billion barrels of oil equivalent, mostly
in the offshore North Field, which the U.S. Energy Information
Administration calls the largest single gas field in the world.
    The World Bank expects the economy to bounce back 2.8
percent this year, and grow another 3 percent in 2019, amid
higher energy prices and as spending on the World Cup continues.
After the games are done, the expansion of LNG output to 110
million tons a year, from around 77 million today, should ensure
massive government cash surpluses for years to come.
    The combination of the World Cup and the boycott appears to
have had another benefit that could elevate Qatar‚Äôs global
standing. Last month, the emir issued a new law partially
scrapping the exit permits that allowed employers to keep
migrant workers ‚Äì of which Qatar has some 1.9 million ‚Äì from
leaving the country. The move drew faint praise from workers‚Äô
rights groups. Amnesty International called it ‚Äúan important
first step towards meeting the authorities' promise to
fundamentally reform the exploitative sponsorship system‚Äù.
    Add it all up, and Qatar appears to have made it through the
blockade with flying colours, supermarket shelves stocked with
goods, its people bursting with patriotism, while also making
progress on the way it treats guest workers. No wonder MbS
appears envious.

President Mario Draghi said on Thursday the longer Brexit talks
drag on, the more the private sector will have to prepare for
the possibility of Britain crashing out of the European Union
with no deal on their future relations.
    London and Brussels say they are close to an agreement, but
they have yet to resolve their differences over the future of
the Irish border, Britain's only land border with the EU.
[nBREXIT]
    Draghi told reporters after an ECB policy-setting meeting he
was confident that ""a good, common-sense solution will be found
where financial stability risks will be minimised"".
    But he also outlined the growing problem that companies face
as Britain's March 2019 exit date nears with no clear idea yet
for them on how Britain and the EU will do business in future.
    ""If this lack of outcome will continue and will approach the
end date, the private sector itself will have to prepare on the
assumption that there will be a hard Brexit,"" he said.
    ""And that's where things may be -- I wouldn't call it
necessarily big financial stability risks, but certainly
uneasiness, financial uneasiness in markets and financial
intermediaries,"" he said.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The pound fell on Thursday as the
dollar strengthened and relief about British Conservative
lawmakers backing Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy
gave way to fresh fears about the risk of a no-deal UK departure
from the European Union.   
    The prospect of politics scuppering a divorce deal has
weakened sterling in recent days. [nL8N1X44ME]
    May received a show of support from her parliamentary party
on Wednesday, dampening fears of an immediate challenge to her
leadership, but this lifted sterling only briefly.  
    By 1310 GMT the pound was down half a percent versus the
dollar at $1.2808 <GBP=D3>, a seven-week low, and down 0.4
percent against the euro to 88.82 pence, its weakest in three
weeks. <EURGBP=D3>
    European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday the longer Brexit talks drag on, the more the private
sector will have to prepare for the possibility of Britain
crashing out without a deal. [nL8N1X57M7]
    Investors said they saw no specific driver for the fall in
sterling but cited broad-based dollar strength and said that
with just over five months until Britain exits the EU the
chances of a no-deal outcome were rising. 
    ""Domestic politics have flared up again and the cumbersome
dynamics will make it challenging for May to get an eventual
deal through the UK Parliament,"" said Alexandra Dumitru, an
economist at Rabobank. 
    ""We still regard a last-minute deal as the most likely
outcome but due to recent events we now estimate the chances of
a ‚Äòhard Brexit‚Äô as almost as high as the base case.""
    Disagreement over a fallback plan for the border between the
British province of Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland
is the major sticking point in the Brexit talks.
    ""If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in
the short term because her replacement could increase the
chances of a no-deal Brexit,"" said David Cheetham, chief market
analyst at broker XTB.
    But the pound ""remains more sensitive to good news than bad
which may mean a fairly sharp move higher should a (Brexit)
agreement be reached.""

    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European Commission has said
Italy's large public debt is a source of ""concern for the euro
area as a whole"" and has asked the government to address worries
about its big-spending 2019 budget by Nov. 13.
    ""Italy's public debt remains a key vulnerability,"" the
Commission wrote in a letter dated Oct. 29, which was released
by the Italian Treasury on Tuesday. The Treasury said it would
respond by the middle of next month, as requested.
    Italy is locked in a tussle with the EU executive, which
earlier this month rejected the government's expansionary budget
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks.
    The ruling coalition has so far ruled this out.
    The budget targets a deficit next year of 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product, up from a targeted 1.8 percent this
year, flouting an EU requirement that the deficit should fall
steadily towards a balanced budget.
    The government has forecast that Italy's debt/GDP ratio will
fall next year to 130.0 percent from a projected 130.9 percent
this year, but the Commission said this was not enough.
    ""Such high public debt constrains the government's room for
manoeuvre (to allow) more productive investment for the benefit
