2,6,195524aefd650b980097488f768351fb,UPDATE 2-ECB's Coeure expects another year of interest rate stability -Tagesspiegel,2018-10-01 0:52:07,EUR,-1.78336,2018-10-01 0:52:12,{'EUR': 'Neutral'}," (Adds comments on euro zone economy, reforms, financial system)
    BERLIN, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank (ECB)
expects interest rates to stay at their current level through
the summer of next year and the scaling back of economic
stimulus measures to be gradual, board member Benoit Coeure told
Germany's Taggespiegel.
    The comments are in line with the bank's previous assertion
that it is comfortable with market expectations for an interest
rate rise in the final quarter of 2019.
    ""We expect interest rates to stay at the current level at
least through the summer of 2019. But we have already started to
reduce our net asset purchases and anticipate them ending after
the end of December,"" Coeure told the newspaper in an interview
released on Sunday ahead of publication on Monday.
    With inflation picking up, the ECB has been curbing stimulus
for months and plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase
scheme in December. 
    Coeure said that ample monetary stimulus would still be
needed to achieve the bank's euro zone inflation target of
below, but close to, 2 percent. 
    ""Price pressures are gradually picking up. But this doesn’t
happen in one day,"" Coeure said, adding that the euro zone
economy was proving very robust.
    But for all its resilience, Coeure said that trade disputes
and declining support for the multilateral order make
strengthening Europe an urgent task.
    Responsible fiscal policies and economic reforms at national
level, completion of the banking union and capital market union
are needed, he said.
    Asked about Brexit, Coeure said that the ECB has to be
prepared for all eventualities. 
    ""Likewise, the financial sector should prepare for the
worst: a no-deal Brexit,"" he said, adding that he hopes the EU
and Britain can reach a deal that allows an orderly Brexit.
    Coeure also said that, while the financial system is far
safer than when the global financial crisis struck 10 years ago,
more work has to be done.
    He warned against complacency and said the next crisis might
not come from the financial system. 
    ""At the ECB, we are currently looking closely at
cybersecurity ...  We don't want the next crisis to be triggered
by a hacker,"" he said.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The standoff between Rome and
Brussels is set to get worse, with the European Commission
expected to formally reject Italy's budget plans in November,
the Italian daily La Repubblica reports. It cited sources saying
the European Union would have little choice given the plan by
the 5-Star Movement and League to push the 2019 deficit up to
2.4 percent of GDP, despite the existing debt overload standing
at over 130 percent of output. Brussels still has time to
consider what its reaction will be. Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria, who sought in vain to persuade the government to ease off
its spending plans, will meet his eurozone peers in Luxembourg
for a regular meeting later today; he was out at the weekend
arguing that better economic growth would eventually help Italy
bring its debt ratio down.
    There was a blizzard of words on Brexit over the weekend as
the ruling Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham began.
Not many of them have added much, but some may contribute to the
worsening mood post-Salzburg - with Foreign Secretary Jeremy
Hunt, for example, likening the EU to a harsh prison from which
other inmates may be tempted to escape. The more placatory
Finance Minister Philip Hammond has just come out and said he
spots a clear willingness in Brussels to do a deal. 
    If there was a strategic benefit to the EU and NATO in
seeing the Greek-Macedonia dispute on its southern flank
settled, that goal suffered a setback at the weekend. Turnout in
Macedonia's crucial name-change referendum was so weak that it
will not be valid. No matter that 90 percent of those who voted
were in favour of the amendment: a boycott call by opponents
plus a poorly handled pro-change campaign meant just 36 percent
of voters bothered to turn up. Macedonia's PM vowed to press on
to solve the row with Greece but Skopje's ambitions to join the
EU and NATO could now be further complicated.
        
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
Optimism about a reconstituted NAFTA and what it means for trade
compromises more broadly have helped world markets kick off the
fourth quarter with a relatively positive spin - even without
Chinese markets, which were out for public holidays. S&P500
stock futures,  Japan’s Nikkei and Canada’s dollar all advanced
about 0.5 percent after the United States and Canada on Sunday
forged a deal to keep a trilateral trade agreement between the
two countries and Mexico alive – and now to be call the United
States Mexico Canada Agreement. Mexico’s peso outperformed and
gained 0.8 percent, while the Nikkei's rise took it to a 27-year
high as the yen weakened to its lowest level against the dollar
in almost a year. The rest of Asia's emerging markets did less
well, with the South Korean and Indonesian main equity
benchmarks in the red on Monday as weekend Chinese business
surveys underwhelmed again. 
    Italy’s contentious budget proposals are also likely to rein
in the mood in Europe later as Italian Finance Minister Tria
heads to Luxembourg to meet his euro group peers after
announcing late Thursday a higher-than-expected 2.4 percent
budget deficit target for next year. While the details of the
budget are still unclear and need to be thrashed out in
parliament over the coming weeks, the 2.4 percent figure
exceeded the 2 percent level Tria has previously indicated was a
ceiling if the country’s debt was to be kept sustainable over
time. While the single-year deficit figure will still mean Italy
runs a primary surplus in excess of 1 percent, keeps its
debt/GDP ratio little changed for the year and mean less than 10
billion euros in net new bond sales, the political ramifications
of a row with Brussels have kept markets on edge. Short-dated
Italian government bond yields extended Friday’s surge and rose
more than 10 basis points first thing on Monday. Tria on Sunday
insisted the debt/GDP ratio would fall by one percentage point a
year over the next three years as growth picks up and that debt
reduction would be guaranteed by a mechanism that automatically
cuts spending if growth falls short. He also said the budget was
""absolutely not a challenge to Europe"". Details are unclear over
how much the increased deficit would involve handouts to poor
Italians, demanded by 5 Star leader Di Maio, and how much would
be investment spending.  
    Euro/dollar was down a touch in early trading, below $1.16
but still off Friday’s lows. European stocks were flat after
heavy losses for Italian and euro zone banks on the budget deal
on Friday. The dollar was higher more broadly, with emerging
-market currencies and equities lower. U.S. Treasury yields were
higher on the trade news and the yield curve steepened a touch.
Brent crude oil added to their recent gains and pushed to a
four-year high above $83 per barrel. Sterling was mixed as
traders kept an eye on this week’s annual conference of the
ruling Conservative Party as it tries to heal rifts over the
government’s negotiating stance over Brexit.

    PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - With growth in many European,
Asian and emerging markets mostly uninspiring, the United States
is increasingly the main motor behind the global economy.
    The world's biggest economy is under scrutiny, however, as
its current upturn is running on borrowed time due to the fiscal
stimulus of debt-financed tax cuts.
    ""When the downturn in the U.S. economy starts, the effects
(on share prices, interest rates, capital flows, emerging
countries, exchange rates, global trade and global growth) will
be very pronounced,"" Natixis chief economist Patrick Artus wrote
in a research note this week.
    ""This downturn in the U.S. economy is inevitable as the
United States is returning to full employment.""
    The only question, he said, was when it would come, and in
his opinion that would be sooner than later.
    Though sanguine about the U.S. outlook through the end of
the year, Barclays conceded it would be harder to predict
further out.
    ""This fiscally induced expansion will be difficult to
sustain in the absence of a much more substantial jump in
investment to lift the economy's growth potential,"" the British
bank's economists wrote in a research note.
    ""In the absence of such a jump, the economy will face
heightened risks of a hard landing in 2020,"" they said.
    A series of business surveys will offer a snapshot of where
the business cycle stood at the end of the third quarter in
major economies.
    Manufacturing surveys for the euro zone and the United
States will be in focus on Monday followed by service sectors
polls on Wednesday.
    But the highlight of the week on the data front will
inevitably be all-important U.S. jobs data on Friday, offering
clues as to whether the tight labour market is driving wages
sharply higher.
    That is important not only for firms' profitability and
consumers' purchasing power, but also because a surge could fuel
a broader inflation pick-up of the sort that could unsettle
central bankers.
    ""Wages will be in focus with another strong month-on-month
rise likely. We probably won't get a break above 3 percent
year-on-year growth this month, but we certainly expect it next
month,"" ING economists wrote in a research note.
    While holidays in China and elsewhere in the region make for
a quiet data week in Asia, politics in Europe may be the source
of market ructions.
    Italy's EU partners will have to figure out quickly whether
to come out hard against the decision of Rome's populist-led
government to flout its previous EU fiscal commitments.
    Italy's unaffiliated technocrat economy minister, Giovanni
Tria, who wanted to respect EU rules, will find himself in the
awkward situation of explaining to his counterparts a decision
he did not support at a euro zone finance ministers meeting on
Monday.
    Sparks are also likely to fly when the UK Conservative Party
meets in Birmingham for an annual conference as Brexit talks
enter a crunch phase. The conference will culminate on Wednesday
with a speech from Prime Minister Theresa May.
    Meanwhile, emerging market concerns are unlikely to subside
with Brazil building up next week to a hotly anticipated
presidential election at the weekend.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - German retail sales fell
unexpectedly for the second month in a row in August and
factories shifted into a lower gear in September, data showed on
Monday, suggesting that Europe's largest economy has lost steam
over the summer.
    Household spending has become a key growth driver in Germany
where consumers benefit from record-high employment, rising real
wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
    But trade disputes abroad and political tensions at home are
both leaving their mark on a still exports-dependent economy
which is now in its ninth year of expansion.
    Retail sales edged down by 0.1 percent on the month in real
terms in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. This was
weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.4 percent
rise and followed a revised drop of 1.1 percent in July.
    On the year, retail rose by 1.6 percent, beating the Reuters
consensus forecast for a 1.5 percent increase and following a
revised 0.9 percent increase in July.
    ""The economic environment for consumption is still
excellent, but many consumers are worried about U.S. tariff
disputes and the many open conflicts in the federal government,""
HDE retail association head Josef Sanktjohanser said.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition has quarrelled
over asylum seekers, immigration and right-wing extremism over
the past months which brought the government close to collapse.
    Sanktjohanser said policymakers must now ensure stability
and dependability at all levels so that consumers would not be
unsettled further by political bickering.
    In a further sign that the economy slowed over the summer, a
survey among purchasing managers in manufacturing showed that
growth eased to a 25-month low in September as new export orders
posted the steepest drop in more than five years. [nL9N1S7029]
    ""It was inevitable that growth would pull back from the high
levels seen last year, but the recent waning of exports has
really taken the wind out of manufacturers' sails in the last
couple of months,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
    He pointed to the escalating trade conflict between the
United States and China, uncertainty surrounding Britain's
planned exit from the EU and Turkey's currency crisis.
    Leading economic institutes said last week they expect
Germany's quarterly growth rate to slow to 0.1 percent in the
third quarter after 0.4 percent in the first and 0.5 percent in
the second. They also blamed bottlenecks in the car industry
caused by new environmental standards for the slowdown.
    The data followed a GfK survey published last week that
showed the mood among German shoppers improved heading into
October, suggesting that consumers will feed growth again in the
fourth quarter despite rising inflation. [nB4N1RA022]

    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's bond yields rose on Monday
as fears that plans for a significant increase in the country's
budget deficit will spark a clash with the EU and exacerbate
already high debt levels weighed on investor sentiment. 
    Italian daily La Repubblica reported on Monday that the
European Commission was set to reject Italy's plans to lift its
budget deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2019 and open a procedure against its public accounts in
February. [nR1N1VZ00C]
    The proposed deficit is three times the previous
administration's target. [nL8N1WD1W3]
    Giovanni Tria, the economy minister in Rome, said on Sunday
that investments would fuel economic growth over the next two
years and debt would be put on a downward path.
    But that failed to reassure uneasy bond markets, with
short-dated bond yields briefly rising more than 15 basis points
on Monday <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>, while five-year Italian debt
insurance costs hit their highest level in a month.
   Barclays analysts said that unless Italy changed its fiscal
stance and/or the European Commission allowed for meaningful
fiscal leeway, frictions between Rome and Brussels were likely
to escalate in coming weeks. 
    They said the backdrop of weakening global demand and
prospects for a less accommodative monetary policy, meant
markets and the European Union would consider it unlikely that
Italy's fiscal measures would be able to raise growth to 1.6
percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020 as projected. 
    Barclays believes growth for 2019 will be just 0.9 percent. 
    ""The fiscal easing measures to be deployed by the government
are likely to be judged only modestly growth friendly,"" the bank
said in a note.
    The European Central Bank's monthly asset purchases fall by
half in October to 15 billion euros, eroding a key layer of
support for Italian bonds.
    
    DOWNGRADE RISK
    Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister said his bank's
base case was now for a sovereign downgrade from major credit
agencies. Moody's and S&P are expected to review Italy's ratings
later this month.
    Italy's public debt level of 131 percent of GDP,
proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece, makes
its bond market particularly vulnerable to any signs of fiscal
slippage.
    Italy's two-year government bond yield surged as much as 18
basis points before pulling back to 1.07 percent, still up 3 bps
on the day.
    Italian five-year yields were up 4 bps, though 10-year bond
yields dipped 2 bps to 3.12 percent <IT10YT=RR>, giving up early
rises.
    Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, said that
while the indicated rise in the budget deficit was not welcome
news, the implications were perhaps as not as dire as indicated
by Friday's bond sell-off.
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the
deficit next year to 2.4 percent of GDP instead of the widely
expected 2.0 percent of GDP should raise the average funding
cost (of Italian debt) by maybe some 5-10 bps – not by anything
like 25-40 bps,"" he said in a note.
    While Italian bonds struggled, the country's stock market
was 1.6 percent higher <.FTMIB> - outperforming the broader euro
zone. The euro was a shade firmer <EUR=>.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields were 2-4 bps higher, as
a last-gasp deal between the United States and Canada on Sunday
to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
pushed investors to riskier assets <BE10YT=RR>, <AT10YT=RR>.

    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The new government
has chosen to fight stuttering growth with tax cuts and a

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The Italian government on Sept. 27 set an annual budget
deficit target of 2.4 percent of GDP for 2019-2021 as part of a
plan that focuses on welfare handouts, early retirement and some
tax cuts. The government has yet to publish the financial
details of its budget.
    - Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Sept 30. that
investment will fuel economic growth over the next two years.
This would allow Italy’s public debt to fall by 1 percentage
point of GDP per year over the three-year period, despite the
increased deficit. Italy’s debt came in at 131 percent of GDP in
2017.
    - An extraordinary investment plan envisages 3.4 billion
euros of spending in 2019, about 0.2 percent of GDP, and double
that the following year, Tria said in an interview with Il Sole
24 Ore newspaper. 
    - Tria said investment spending will boost Italy’s growth to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2019. Without the budget stimulus, growth
would only be 0.9 percent, he said.
    - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a separate investment
plan involving state-owned companies would see 38 billion euros
invested over the next 15 years.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government has chosen to fight stuttering growth with handouts
and tax cuts. Ministers believe spending measures that will
expand the budget deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP next year should
boost domestic consumption and help increase economic growth to
1.6 percent. However, the plan lacks a strategy to tackle
stubbornly high youth unemployment.
    While Italy’s overall jobless rate has fallen to pre-crisis
levels, unemployment among those aged less than 24 ticked up to
31 percent in August. Nearly 30 percent of those between 20 and
34 are not studying, working nor training – the worst rate in
the European Union, Eurostat data show. 
    That radical parties that make up Italy’s new government are
trying to partly address the issue through welfare support. The
so-called “citizens’ income” is the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement’s most important electoral promise. The measure which
will cost 10 billion euros a year envisages handing a monthly
check worth up to 780 euros a month to those living below the
poverty line, including pensioners. Labour Minister Luigi Di
Maio says the handout could benefit 6.5 million recipients,
though those who are working age must prove they are actively
seeking a job.
    The generous approach could be a much-needed stopgap for
Italy’s unemployed, particularly the young. In the country’s
impoverished southern regions, where 5-Star won more than half
of the votes, almost one in two young Italians is economically
inactive.
    Yet, bigger handouts will do little to improve the long-term
situation if no new jobs are created. The government hopes that
lowering the retirement age will create 400,000 new vacancies.
But the threat of global trade war, rising yields on Italian
government bonds and uncertainty about Italy’s role in the EU
may make businesses reluctant to swiftly substitute departing
older workers with new ones. Morale among Italian manufacturers
hit a 20-month low in August. Think thank Prometeia reckons that
while extra spending should boost growth by about 0.3 percentage
points of GDP in 2019, this could be cancelled out by higher
borrowing costs and growing uncertainty.
    Italy has openly challenged EU rules by opting for
expansionary policies that might boost its public debt. The
danger is that what it gives with one hand, it will take with
the other.

118,272,b39a89b73124cbff66f372fe9ab5ba67,"Greece to submit 2019 draft budget, hoping to avoid pension cuts",2018-10-01 22:33:49,EUR,0,2018-10-01 22:33:57,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    ATHENS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Greece's government will submit
its 2019 draft budget to parliament on Monday evening, aiming to
outperform its primary surplus targets for a fifth year and
avoid implementing painful pension cuts agreed with creditors.
    Greece emerged from an international bailout in August.
    The government has promised its international lenders it
will achieve a primary budget surplus, excluding debt servicing
outlays, of least 3.5 percent of economic output up to 2022. 
    Hinging on its fiscal outpeformance, Athens hopes its euro
zone lenders will allow it to skip pension cuts scheduled to
kick in next year, when the left-right coalition government's
term expires.
    In its first post-bailout budget, Athens is also expected to
project economic growth of about 2.5 percent next year, Prime
Minister Alexis Tsipras said last week. The economy is seen
growing by 2.1 percent this year.  
    ""Today's fiscal environment and the Greek government's
intention to proceed with fiscal interventions which will
prevent cutting pensions will be reflected in the draft budget,""
government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters.
    Tzanakopoulos said talks with the EU Commission on freezing
pension cuts were progressing ""on good terms"". 
    Solving this issue amicably is crucial as the country is
closely monitored by markets and any sign of fiscal deviation
may plunge it back into crisis.   
    ""Some common ground will be found with the Commission, since
it is self-evident that the 3.5 percent primary surplus can be
achieved without implementing the fiscal measure of pension
cuts,"" he said.
    In the meantime, the government is likely to submit a draft
budget which will include fiscal scenarios rather than clarity 
on whether it will implement the cuts. 
    Greece has also promised to hand out a social dividend to
those hit hardest during the debt crisis which broke out in
2010. But the exact amount to be spent will be decided after
deliberations with the EU Commission, Tzanakopoulos said.
    Last month, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras used a keynote
policy speech in the northern city of Thessaloniki to announce a
spending spree that he said would help fix the ills of years of
belt-tightening and boost growth.[L5N1VU0ON]
    Greece will submit its final 2019 budget in mid-November.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government has chosen to fight stuttering growth with handouts
and tax cuts. Ministers believe spending measures that will
expand the budget deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP next year should
boost domestic consumption and help increase economic growth to
1.6 percent. However, the plan lacks a strategy to tackle
stubbornly high youth unemployment.
    While Italy’s overall jobless rate has fallen to pre-crisis
levels, unemployment among those aged less than 24 ticked up to
31 percent in August. Nearly 30 percent of those between 20 and
34 are not studying, working nor training – the worst rate in
the European Union, Eurostat data show. 
    That radical parties that make up Italy’s new government are
trying to partly address the issue through welfare support. The
so-called “citizens’ income” is the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement’s most important electoral promise. The measure which
will cost 10 billion euros a year envisages handing a monthly
check worth up to 780 euros a month to those living below the
poverty line, including pensioners. Labour Minister Luigi Di
Maio says the handout could benefit 6.5 million recipients,
though those who are working age must prove they are actively
seeking a job.
    The generous approach could be a much-needed stopgap for
Italy’s unemployed, particularly the young. In the country’s
impoverished southern regions, where 5-Star won more than half
of the votes, almost one in two young Italians is economically
inactive.
    Yet, bigger handouts will do little to improve the long-term
situation if no new jobs are created. The government hopes that
lowering the retirement age will create 400,000 new vacancies.
But the threat of global trade war, rising yields on Italian
government bonds and uncertainty about Italy’s role in the EU
may make businesses reluctant to swiftly substitute departing
older workers with new ones. Morale among Italian manufacturers
hit a 20-month low in August. Think thank Prometeia reckons that
while extra spending should boost growth by about 0.3 percentage
points of GDP in 2019, this could be cancelled out by higher
borrowing costs and growing uncertainty.
    Italy has openly challenged EU rules by opting for
expansionary policies that might boost its public debt. The
danger is that what it gives with one hand, it will take with
the other.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The Italian government on Sept. 27 set an annual budget
deficit target of 2.4 percent of GDP for 2019-2021 as part of a
plan that focuses on welfare handouts, early retirement and some
tax cuts. The government has yet to publish the financial
details of its budget.
    - Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Sept 30. that
investment will fuel economic growth over the next two years.
This would allow Italy’s public debt to fall by 1 percentage
point of GDP per year over the three-year period, despite the
increased deficit. Italy’s debt came in at 131 percent of GDP in
2017.
    - An extraordinary investment plan envisages 3.4 billion
euros of spending in 2019, about 0.2 percent of GDP, and double
that the following year, Tria said in an interview with Il Sole
24 Ore newspaper. 
    - Tria said investment spending will boost Italy’s growth to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2019. Without the budget stimulus, growth
would only be 0.9 percent, he said.
    - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a separate investment
plan involving state-owned companies would see 38 billion euros
invested over the next 15 years.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's shorter-dated bond yields
jumped to one-month highs on Monday, pushed up by fears that
plans for a significant increase in the country's budget deficit
will spark a clash with the EU and exacerbate already high debt
levels.
    European Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Italian
fiscal plans ""obviously"" were deviating from EU rules and
previous commitments. [nS8N1VJ00S]   
    Those comments followed a report by Italian daily La
Repubblica that the European Commission was set to reject
Italy's decision to lift its budget deficit to 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. [nR1N1VZ00C]
    The proposed deficit is three times the previous
administration's target. [nL8N1WD1W3]
   Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio late on Monday
accused EU officials of deliberately upsetting financial markets
by making negative comments about Italy's budget plans.
[nR1N1VZ00H]
    News late in the day that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
will return to Rome early from meetings in Luxembourg with his
EU counterparts to work on the budget plan fuelled the
uncertainty, analysts said. [nR1N1VZ00G]
    ""This afternoon we've had some very negative comments from
the euro group meeting but there is also uncertainty with Tria
coming home and that is part of the story,"" said DZ Bank rates
strategist Sebastian Fellechner. 
    Italy's two-year bond yield surged 25 basis points to 1.34
percent <IT2YT=RR>, five-year debt yields were 30 bps higher at
2.51 percent <IT5YT=RR>. Both hit one-month highs.
    Five-year Italian debt insurance costs also hit one-month
highs but held below levels seen in late May.
    Tria said on Sunday that investments would fuel economic
growth over the next two years and debt would be put on a
downward path.
    Still, Barclays analysts said that unless Italy changed its
fiscal stance and/or the European Commission allowed for
meaningful fiscal leeway, frictions between Rome and Brussels
were likely to escalate. 
    They said the backdrop of weakening global demand and
prospects for a less accommodative monetary policy, meant
markets and the European Union would consider it unlikely that
Italy's fiscal measures would be able to raise growth to 1.6
percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020 as projected. 
    Barclays believes growth for 2019 will be just 0.9 percent. 
    The European Central Bank's monthly asset purchases fall by
half in October to 15 billion euros, eroding a key layer of
support for Italian bonds.
    
    DOWNGRADE RISK
    Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister said his bank's
base case was now for a sovereign downgrade from major credit
agencies. Moody's and S&P are expected to review Italy's ratings
later this month.
    Italy's public debt level of 131 percent of GDP,
proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece, makes
its bond market particularly vulnerable to any signs of fiscal
slippage.
    As Italy's 10-year bond yield rose 15 bps to 3.29 percent
<IT10YT=RR>, the Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap
<DE10YT=RR> widened to around 280 bps, its highest in a month.
    ""We feel ultimately markets will exert pressure back on them
(Italy) again as spreads widen and at some point refunding costs
become much more expensive,"" said Guy Miller, chief market
strategist and head of macroeconomics at Zurich Insurance Group.
    ""Hopefully that will give them a signal they can't continue
doing what they are doing as markets will react.""     
    Italy's stock market gave up early gains and was down 0.4
percent <.FTMIB> in late trade. The euro was a shade weaker
<EUR=>.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields were 1-2 bps higher, as
a last-gasp deal between the United States and Canada on Sunday
to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
pushed investors to riskier assets. [nL2N1WG084]

    By Lefteris Papadimas and George Georgiopoulos
    ATHENS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Greece on Monday unveiled next
year's budget draft, aiming to attain a bigger primary surplus
than that agreed with its international creditors, projecting
that economic growth will pick up to 2.5 percent.
    In what will be the first budget with the country out of
bailout programmes, the government aims to outperform on primary
surplus targets for a fifth straight year to be in a position to
avoid implementing painful pension cuts agreed with creditors.
    Athens emerged from an international bailout in August.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pitched rescinding unpopular
pension cuts slated for January as part of relief measures,
claiming there is ample fiscal space to do so.
    The government, which has promised its euro zone lenders and
the International Monetary Fund it will achieve a 3.5 percent of
GDP primary budget surplus excluding debt servicing outlays, is
targeting a surplus of 4.14 percent next year. If it does not
apply the cuts it puts the figure at 3.56 percent.         
    Trailing the conservative opposition in polls, Tsipras is
counting on a less austere budget to gain voters next year, when
his term expires.
    The draft budget projects economic growth will pick up to 
2.5 percent from an expected 2.1 percent this year.  
    ""The tax burden relief and the lowering of social security
contributions would not be possible without the fiscal
performance of the last three years, the fruit of the sacrifices
of Greek citizens,"" the draft said.  
    Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters
earlier on Monday that talks with the EU Commission on freezing
pension cuts were progressing ""on good terms"". 
    Solving this issue amicably is crucial as the country is
closely monitored by markets and any sign of fiscal slippage may
plunge it back into crisis.   
    ""Some common ground will be found with the Commission, since
it is self-evident that the 3.5 percent primary surplus can be
achieved without implementing the fiscal measure of pension
cuts,"" the spokesman said.
    The budget plan projects public debt will fall to 170.2
percent of GDP next year from 183 percent in 2018.
    Tsipras has promised to hand out a social dividend to those
hit hardest during the debt crisis which broke out in 2010. The
exact amount to be spent will be decided after deliberations
with the EU Commission.
    Last month, Tsipras used a keynote policy speech to announce
measures that would help fix the ills of years of
belt-tightening. According to the draft budget these measures
total 1.1 billion euros.[L5N1VU0ON]
    Greece will submit its final 2019 budget in mid-November.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Claudio Borghi, the economic head
of Italy's ruling League party, has sent bond yields up this
morning with a comment that the country would be better off if
it returned to the lira. That came after eurozone officials last
night warned Rome its plan to borrow billions of extra euros to
fund spending pledges could tip the single currency region back
into crisis, signalling that they would put pressure on Italy's
new rulers to change course. Its 2019-2021 budget targets are
due to be finalised later today, with the 5-Star coalition
partner insisting that the 2019 deficit remain at the 2.4
percent/GDP mark which has got financial markets so worried.
    Today it is Boris Johnson's turn to speak at the
Conservative Party's annual conference in what some in the local
media are portraying as a ""put up or shut up"" moment for the
former foreign secretary and his leadership ambitions. A
photograph released this week of him running through a field of
wheat - a blatant jibe on Theresa May's self-confessed
""naughtiest"" moment as a child - might make his fans giggle but
some in the party offer it as proof that he is not leadership
material.
    Clashes between police and Catalan independence supporters
in Barcelona last night show the issue has lost none of its
potency a year on from the illegal referendum of 2017. Polls in
Catalonia show a relatively even split between those who favour
remaining in Spain and those wanting to secede. Prime Minister
Pedro Sanchez has said he favours dialogue on the region's
future but like his predecessor has ruled out any moves towards
independence. Today the regional parliament is due to vote on
whether former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and several
members of his government can keep their seats as lawmakers
while still under investigation or in prison under charges of
rebellion. 
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
    Market fears that Italy’s budget standoff would inevitably
lead to a rise in euro exit speculation were realized again
after a senior figure within the ruling League party, Claudio
Borghi, who chairs the lower house budget committee, said many
of Italy’s economic problems would be solved with its own
currency. Already restive bond markets, unnerved since last
week’s unveiling of a higher-than-expected 2.4 percent budget
deficit target for next year and the early exit on Monday of
finance minister Tria from euro group meetings in Luxembourg,
took fright again first thing today. Critically, the 10-year
Italian government bond yield broke above May’s post-election
peaks to hit its highest level in 4-1/2 years. The yield spread
with Germany rose to within 4 basis points of May’s peak.
Euro/dollar fell about 0.4 percent to hover just above last
month’s lows and reigniting dollar strength across the board.
The latest Italian jolt has European stock futures pointing
lower too, with Italian banks expected to take the heat from the
fresh jump in the sovereign debt spreads. While Borghi may be an
outlier, his comments reflect a sharpening of language and a
rise in confrontational statements from the ruling coalition.
Deputy PM di Maio on Monday described any European Union
criticism of Italy’s latest budget proposals as attempts at
“creating terrorism on the markets” and on Tuesday insisted the
2.4 percent deficit target would stand, with details finalised
on Tuesday. He said French President Macron and German
Chancellor Merkel wanted Italy’s government to fail. 
    The sour mood in Europe offset optimism on Wall St overnight
over weekend agreements to preserve NATFA as a trilateral trade
agreement. But the clouds darkened in Asia amid concerns about a
worldwide slowdown in economic activity. IMF chief Lagarde on
Monday flagged a likely cut in the Fund’s latest world economic
growth forecast next week and the latest global manufacturing
surveys from around the world signalled a significant cooling of
factory output last month. JP Morgan’s global manufacturing
output PMI fell almost a full point to its lowest level last
month since September 2016. Shanghai markets remained closed for
the week, but other Asia bourses were lower. A re-opened Hang
Seng dropped more than 2 percent and Seoul’s Kospi lost more
than 1 percent. MSCI’s emerging market equity benchmark staged
its biggest one-day drop in almost a month. The stronger dollar
pushed many emerging market currencies back lower, with a slide
in Indonesia’s rupiah to its lowest since 1998 the standout move
as the country comes to terms with the weekend’s devastating
earthquake and tsunami. The latest surge in world oil prices has
added to growth worries, with Brent crude oil prices soaring to
new 4-year highs above $85. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields
slipped first thing Tuesday, with eyes on a speech by Fed chair
Powell and several other Fed policymakers later in the day.

Ewald Nowotny warned against taking away banking supervision
responsibilities from the ONB, telling ORF radio on Tuesday such
a move would be unique in Europe and increase risks in case of a
new crisis.
    Austria's finance ministry is currently reviewing the
structure of the country's banking supervision, partly due to
the court of auditors' criticism of overlapping approaches. 
    The supervision of banks operating in Austria is, within the
European Central Bank's banking watchdog SSM, shared by the ECB,
the Financial Market Authority (FMA) and the ONB.
    The national bank is in charge of fact finding. It
undertakes on-site inspections, analyzes information, drafts
reports and processes data reporting. The FMA monitors
compliance with the relevant rules and is also the Austrian
resolution authority.    
    The finance ministry has said that a complete transfer of
competencies to the FMA was one option being discussed.
    ""This would be... unique in Europe. In virtually all
European states, the central bank is closely involved in banking
supervision,"" Nowotny, who is also a member of the ECB's
governing council, said. 
    Taking banking supervision tasks from the ONB would be a
""dangerous path"" that could hit the banks and the Austrian
economy, he said. As a central bank is involved in bank rescue
operations in the event of a crisis, it was important to have
first hand information and to share information with the other
European central banks.    
    ""In the event of a crisis, the central bank could not react
as quickly as it does now because it would be cut off from the
complete and concrete knowledge of the situation of the
individual banks.""

    HELSINKI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - There is no room for lowering
capital requirements for euro zone banks but watchdogs should
avoid ""straight-jacketing"" bankers and stifling innovation, a
European Central Bank supervisor said on Tuesday.
    Pentti Hakkarainen, a member of the ECB's Single Supervisory
Board that oversees the euro zone's largest banks, batted back
industry complaints over how much cash and capital banks have
been asked to set aside in the aftermath of the financial
crisis.
    He cited a 2010 study that put the ideal level of Tier 1
capital at between 16 percent and 19 percent of risk-weighted
assets - higher than current levels in the euro zone.
    ""I do not see anything within recent research that leads me
to think this estimate was too high,"" Pentti Hakkarainen told an
audience in Helsinki.
    ""As both our minimum standards and global banks' current
capital ratios remain somewhat short of this level – I see no
room for relaxing capital requirements at this time,"" he added.
    The ECB has put pressure on banks to build up equity and
other capital since taking over as supervisor four years ago, in
a bid to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and the
ensuing taxpayer-funded bailouts.

194,457,e7fd4a2f8ed0854424646ee270ed78cd,UPDATE 2-ECB supervisor sees no room for lowering capital demand on banks,2018-10-02 15:47:12,EUR,0,2018-10-02 15:47:18,{'EUR': 'Positive'}," (Adds quotes, detail, background)
    HELSINKI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - There is no room for lowering
capital requirements for euro zone banks but watchdogs should
avoid ""straight-jacketing"" bankers and stifling innovation, a
European Central Bank supervisor said on Tuesday.
    Pentti Hakkarainen, a member of the ECB's Single Supervisory
Board that oversees the euro zone's largest banks, batted back
industry complaints over how much cash and capital banks have
been asked to set aside in the aftermath of the financial
crisis.
    He cited a 2010 study that put the ideal level of Tier 1
capital at between 16 percent and 19 percent of risk-weighted
assets - higher than current levels in the euro zone.
    ""I do not see anything within recent research that leads me
to think this estimate was too high,"" Pentti Hakkarainen told an
audience in Helsinki.
    ""As both our minimum standards and global banks' current
capital ratios remain somewhat short of this level – I see no
room for relaxing capital requirements at this time,"" he added.
    The ECB has put pressure on banks to build up capital since
taking over as supervisor four years ago, in a bid to avoid a
repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing
taxpayer-funded bailouts.    
    Tier 1 capital ratios in the euro zone have increased on
average by 3.4 percentage points since then and are now above 15
percent, Hakkarainen said.
    But he said supervisors should be wary of going too far,
particularly if their actions have side effects that had not
been anticipated when the rules were written.
    ""We need to avoid straight-jacketing balance sheets
excessively,"" Hakkarainen said.
    ""We must continue to allow market participants to have the
space to decide for themselves their business strategies, giving
bankers the space to breathe and to innovate in the interests of
customers,"" he added.

    PRAGUE, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman may
tap economist and investment strategist Ales Michl, who advises
Prime Minister Andrej Babis, to fill one of two seats coming
free on the central bank board this year, daily Lidove Noviny
reported on Tuesday.
    The newspaper, citing two sources, said Michl, 40, could
replace Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl, whose final term at the bank
finishes at the end of November along with Vice-Governor
Vladimir Tomsik.
    The president's spokesman declined to comment on the report,
while Michl was not immediately available. He had declined
earlier to comment for the newspaper.
    The report mentioned other names which have been circulated
in the past as possible candidates for the central bank board,
including the current chief of the bank's monetary section which
prepares the quarterly economic outlook for the board, Tomas
Holub.
    Besides him, former board member Jan Frait, who now heads
the financial stability department, and his deputy, Libor Holub,
were also mentioned.
    Michl worked for almost a decade until 2015 as an investment
strategist at Raiffeisenbank, the Czech unit of Austrian bank
Raiffeisen. He later went on to found an investment group that
uses algorithms to invest into U.S. shares and bonds.
    Tomsik and Hampl are the last board members appointed by the
previous president, Vaclav Klaus, who had favoured more
eurosceptic economists than Zeman.
    The central bank advises the government on the country's
eventual adoption of the common euro currency that it committed
to when joining the European Union in 2004. The state currently
does not have any target date. 
    Governor Jiri Rusnok, who is an economic adviser to Zeman,
has sat on the board since 2014 and led it since 2016.
    The central bank quit an intervention regime keeping the
crown weak in 2017 after using it for almost four years, part of
efforts to revive inflation after the country went through two
recessions following the global financial crisis a decade ago.
    Since letting the crown float free again, the bank has been
the most aggressive in the EU in normalising policy by raising
its main interest rate <CZCBIR=ECI> in six steps to 1.50
percent, including hikes at its past three meetings.[nL8N1WC446]
    The bank seeks to keep inflation close to a 2 percent target
and is contending with a fast-growing economy in which
unemployment is the lowest in the EU and wages are growing the
fastest in 15 years along with a hot real estate market.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - World stocks went south and
European assets sold off on Tuesday after anti-euro comments
from an Italian party official weighed on the single currency
and sent Italy's bond yields up to multi-year highs.
    A boost to investors' risk appetite from the new
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact proved short-lived with the MSCI
world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> falling back 0.3 percent. 
    The leading index of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> lost 0.8
percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> fell 0.5
percent, tracking Asian stocks lower and extending losses as
Italian assets were under renewed stress.
    Italian government bonds sold off after the economic head of
the ruling League party said most of Italy's problems could be
solved by having its own currency. [nR1N1VZ00K]
    Italian 10-year bond yields hit a new 4 1/2 year high and
shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, which have large sovereign
bond holdings, sold off sharply to hit a 19-month low, down 2.8
percent. Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> tumbled 1.4 percent.
    Euro zone banks also dropped 1.3 percent as the comments
reignited investors' anxieties about contagion to euro zone
finances from Italy's higher budget deficit plans, which the
government set out on Thursday.    
    ""While our economists do not expect systemic implications
for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,"" said
Goldman Sachs analysts.
    ""We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there
is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the
high trade exposure to Italy.""
    The euro <EUR=> fell 0.3 percent, briefly touching its
lowest since Aug 21 at $1.1523 and last trading at $1.1536.
    The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a
significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy's
debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European
Union's.
    ""The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great
fudges - think of the case of Greece,"" said David Keir, manager
of the global income and growth fund at Saracen. 
    ""But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading.
The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political
decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,"" he added. 
    
    DOLLAR GRINDS EMERGING MARKETS DOWN
    Asian stocks were lower as the lift from an agreement that
saved the North American free trade deal faded.
    China's financial markets are closed for the week of Oct.
1-5 for national holidays, but China's weaker manufacturing PMI
surveys also hit Hong Kong stocks. 
    The United States and Canada forged a last-minute deal on
Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico,
rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to
collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation.
[nL8N1WH2Z5]  
    The trade pact helped the dollar index <.DXY> rise 0.2
percent to 95.594, its highest since Sept 5.
    The dollar at a three-week high weighed on emerging markets
stocks <.MSCIEF> which suffered their biggest one-day losses in
a month.
    The greenback drew support from an uptick in U.S. Treasury
yields as Wall Street gains curbed demand for safe-haven debt.
    Oil prices recoiled slightly, having hit nearly four-year
highs in the previous session.
    Crude contracts surged nearly 3 percent to $75.77 a barrel,
their highest since November 2014, as the deal to salvage NAFTA
stoked economic growth expectations, with impending U.S.
sanctions on Iran seen raising prices. [O/R]
    U.S. crude futures <CLc1> were up 0.3 percent at $75.52 a
barrel.
    Brent crude <LCOc1> edged down 0.2 percent to just under the
$85 a barrel level, after rallying 2.7 percent the previous day
to a $85.45, highest since November 2014.

more-than-expected in August, driven higher by more costly
energy, according to data released on Tuesday.
    EU statistics agency Eurostat said prices at factory gates
in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent
month-on-month in August against market expectations of a 0.2
percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
    Year-on-year, producer prices rose by 4.2 percent in August,
against market expectations of a 3.9 percent gain.
    Figures for July were also revised up to 0.7 percent
month-on-month and to and an 18-month high of 4.3 percent
year-on-year.
    Energy prices rose 0.9 percent during August and were 12.0
percent higher than a year earlier.
    Without volatile energy, producer prices were unchanged 
month-on-month and up 1.5 percent year-on-year, confirming the
view of European Central Bank that spiking energy prices are the
main reason for higher inflation.
    Prices at factory gates herald trends in consumer inflation
because unless absorbed by intermediaries or retailers, higher
producer costs translate directly into higher consumer prices.
    The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation
below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. An early
Eurostat estimate showed last week that in September, consumer
inflation was 2.1 percent year-on-year.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's said it was
questionable whether Italy's current political environment would
allow key structural reforms to take place but played down the
possibility that Rome could exit the euro zone.
    Italian financial markets and the euro sold off earlier on
Tuesday after Carlo Borghi, a lawmaker from one of the two
ruling parties, said most of the country's problems would be
solved if it returned to its own currency. They recovered
somewhat after he said the country was not planning to leave the
euro [nR1N1RB01P]
    Moody's, which rates Italy Baa2 with a negative outlook, is
due to provide an updated decision on Italy's credit rating by
the end of October at the latest, having delayed its scheduled
review from September 7. 
    The agency said in comments released for publication late on
Monday that the review for possible downgrade hinged on Italy's
debt trajectory and economic growth, both of which are linked to
structural reforms being implemented 
    ""Italy has long had an elevated debt burden and has long had
problems generating economic growth and the political
environment that can allow structural reform efforts to take
place is also in question,"" Sarah Carlson, senior vice president
in the Moody's sovereign team said in a conference call.
    ""It comes down to the debt trajectory and growth which is
linked to structural reform effort,"" Carlson added.
    Investors are concerned that a higher-than-expected budget
deficit of 2.4 percent will weaken Italy's ability to service
its debt pile of 131 percent of gross domestic product and risk
lowering its credit rating, putting it on the cusp of falling
below the investment grade category. 
    However, Moody's played down fears for euro zone stability
stemming from Italy and the possibility of the country exiting
the single currency, noting Italians had shown reluctance to
leave the euro. Italy was ""more integrated with Europe than has
been feared over the past few years"", the agency added.
    Fitch reviewed Italy in August and while it kept the rating
unchanged at BBB, it put Italy on negative outlook. S&P reviews
Italy on October 26. It currently rates Italy at BBB with a
stable outlook.

debt with negative yields fell to just over 33 percent in
September from 37 percent in August, the lowest since Tradeweb
started collating monthly data on the pool of negative-yielding
bonds on its trading platform.
    Bond yields across the world have risen in recent weeks in
response to hawkish rhetoric from central bank officials and as
strong economic data boosts expectations for tighter monetary
policies from major central banks.
    Of around the 7.43 trillion euros of the bonds in the
system, about 2.48 trillion euros, or 33.38 percent, yield less
than zero, Tradeweb data published late on Monday showed.
    Tradeweb's data shows around 18 percent of euro zone
government bonds yield less than the ECB's deposit rate of minus
0.4 percent, the lowest since Tradeweb started collecting data
on negative-yielding bonds in June 2016.
    Almost 17 percent of the euro-denominated investment-grade
corporate bonds available on the Tradeweb platform yielded less

    Tradeweb's data is based on statistics as of the end of

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a six-week low on
Tuesday after a senior official from Italy's ruling party said
most of the country's problems would be resolved if it scrapped
the euro for a national currency, triggering a broad market
sell-off.
    The euro also slumped against the safe-haven yen and Swiss
franc, while the dollar surged to a one-month high as investors
piled into greenback and sold riskier assets such as equities. 
    Markets are highly sensitive to Italian political
developments after the ruling parties proposed a budget with a
higher-than-expected deficit target, exacerbating tensions with
other euro zone leaders and worrying investors who want Rome to
bring its debt under control.
    The euro's weakness combined with a further push higher by
the dollar, which is regaining its stride despite investor
positioning in the greenback looking stretched.
    The single currency <EUR=> skidded to as low as $1.1507, its
weakest since Aug. 21. Against the yen, the euro fell 0.9
percent to 130.80 <EURJPY=> and tumbled 0.6 percent versus the
Swiss franc to 1.1317 francs <EURCHF=>.  
    ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one
side and Italy on the other ... There's a lot of headline risk
about,"" Credit Agricole head of G10 FX Strategy Valentin Marinov
said. 
    Marinov said he did not expect the situation in Italy to
weigh heavily on the euro in the medium term because there was
""no real evidence of contagion"" that would worry the European
Central Bank and prompt it to postpone a gradual end to its
fiscal stimulus.
    Most of the euro's losses came after Claudio Borghi, the
economic head of the ruling League party, said Italy would enjoy
more favourable economic conditions outside the euro zone.
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    Borghi later rowed back on the comments, and said Italy's
government had no intention of leaving the euro [nR1N1RB01P]. 
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who accuses
European Union officials of deliberately upsetting financial
markets with negative comments about Italy's budget plans, also
said Italy would not change its budget deficit targets.
[nL8N1WI14R]
    Commerzbank analysts said that even if the EU did not reject
Italy's budget, it could still act as a hurdle for the euro,
especially as some analysts expect credit ratings agencies to
downgrade Italy's government debt. 
    ""Even if the subject (of Italy) seems to remain on the back
burner for the FX market at present, market participants should
keep a close eye on it. It can cook up more rapidly than we
think,"" they said.    
    
    DOLLAR RALLY
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.4 percent to 95.684, a
one-month high.
    Fears about trade conflicts between the United States and
major trading partners, including China, have lifted the dollar
this year, as has an increasingly confident U.S. Federal Reserve
especially as the U.S. central bank looks increasingly alone in
tightening policy. 
    Against the yen <JPY=>, the dollar fell 0.3 percent to
113.74 yen on the Japanese currency's safe-haven status. 
    The U.S.-Canada trade deal announced on Monday had sent the
yen to an 11-month low of 114.06 per dollar as the agreement
boosted investor appetite for taking risks.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> - often viewed as a barometer
of risk appetite - fell 0.9 percent $0.7162 as markets worldwide
sold off on the euro zone concerns.
    The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it had held interest
rates at 1.5 percent, a widely expected decision. [nL4N1WI00J]
    The Canadian <CAD=> fell 0.2 percent to C$1.2834 per dollar,
reversing some of its gains the previous day.

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Union needs
clearer rules against money laundering that would apply equally
to all EU countries, European Central Bank Vice President Luis
de Guindos said on Tuesday, but several governments, including
Germany, urged caution.
    The 28-nation bloc is grappling with a string of
high-profile cases of money laundering at banks in several
member states, including Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Malta and Latvia.
    ""A higher level of harmonisation of the applicable rules in
the form of a regulation should be considered"", de Guindos told
EU finance ministers during a public debate in Luxembourg. 
    An EU regulation is directly applicable in all EU countries,
but EU rules against money laundering are currently defined in
directives which give governments broad leeway in their
application. This has resulted in different levels of
enforcement and gaps in the EU framework.
    However, EU governments have long been reluctant to give
away national powers to monitor banks and fight crime.
    Many of them confirmed on Tuesday their scepticism to de
Guindos's appeal and to a European Commission's plan to slightly
strengthen common supervision against money laundering.
    Germany, the largest country of the bloc, asked for more
time in changing the current framework. 
    Replying to de Guindos's proposal on transforming directives
into a regulation, Joerg Kukies, Germany's state secretary at
the finance ministry said: ""We think this is not an easy thing
to do in the short term but something we would be very open to
discuss"".
    The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Estonia and Finland said more
time was needed to decide on which changes would be needed,
confirming the sceptical line they held in closed-door meetings
[nL8N1W74DQ].
    Hungary opposed any proposal that would reduce national
powers.

243,538,27980b2426b4c7a7a8c3b5a62365a4a8,Portugal PM reaffirms 2019 budget deficit goal of 0.2 pct/GDP,2018-10-02 18:20:53,EUR,6.70621,2018-10-02 18:20:59,{'EUR': 'Negative'},"    LISBON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Portugal's 2019 draft budget will
target a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP, down from this year's
estimated 0.7 percent, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said,
confirming an earlier plan released in April which was
criticised by his leftist allies.
    In an interview with TVI television channel, Costa said the
budget negotiations with the Left Bloc and the Communist party,
which back the minority Socialist government in parliament, ""are
going well"" as he reaffirmed the deficit target.
    ""We should close the year with (a budget deficit of) 0.7
percent and 0.2 percent next year. We won't have an
electioneering budget,"" he said, referring to next year's
national election.
    The Socialists lead in opinion polls by a wide margin,
although just short of a parliament majority, which means they
will probably have to maintain an alliance on the left.
    The government will present the budget in October.
    Since coming to power in late 2015, Costa's government has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with measures to support
growth, while reversing most of the austerity policies imposed
by a centre-right administration during the 2010-14 debt crisis.
    In a stability programme for 2018-2022, presented in April,
the government also projected a surplus - which would be the
country's first - of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2020.
    The Eurosceptic Left Bloc and the Communists have argued
that the administration should spend more on healthcare and
civil servant wages rather than focusing on cutting the deficit.
    Last year Portugal hit a more than four-decade low in its
budget gap of 0.9 percent of GDP, excluding a one-off bank
recapitalisation, as the economy grew 2.7 percent - its
strongest pace since 2000.
    Growth this year should be 2.2-2.3 percent in a slowdown
from last year, with the same pace of expansion expected next
year and in 2020.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Stocks fell worldwide and European
assets sold off on Tuesday after anti-euro comments from an
Italian lawmaker dented the single currency and sent Italy's
bond yields to multi-year highs.
    A boost to investors' risk appetite from the new
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact proved short-lived with the MSCI
world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> falling back 0.4 percent, its
biggest loss in a month. 
    The leading index of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> lost 1
percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> fell 0.7
percent, tracking Asian stocks lower and extending losses as
Italian assets came under renewed stress.
    U.S. futures also traded down 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent.
    Claudio Borghi, the economics spokesman of Italy's ruling
League party, said in a radio interview that most of the
country's problems could be solved by having its own currency. 
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new
4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German
yields to the widest for more than five years. [nL8N1WI11F]
    Shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, which have large
sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low, falling as much as
2.8 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> tumbled 1.2 percent.
    Clarifying his remarks later, Borghi told Reuters that
Italy's government has no intention of leaving the euro.
However, the spectre of a euro zone breakup and stern words from
EU officials about Italy's budget kept markets on edge.
[nR1N1RB01P]
    Euro zone banks <.SX7E> also dropped 1 percent as the
comments reignited investors' anxieties about contagion in the
euro zone from Italy's higher-than-expected budget deficit
plans, which the government set out on Thursday.    
    ""While our economists do not expect systemic implications
for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,"" Goldman
Sachs analysts said.
    ""We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there
is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the
high trade exposure to Italy.""
    The euro <EUR=> extended losses to fall 0.6 percent to its
lowest since Aug. 21 at $1.1504 and was last trading at $1.1509.
    The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a
significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy's
debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European
Union's.
    ""The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great
fudges - think of the case of Greece,"" the Saracen global income
and growth fund's manager, David Keir, said. 
    ""But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading.
The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political
decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,"" he said. 
    
    
    DOLLAR GRINDS EMERGING MARKETS DOWN
    Asian stocks were lower as the lift from an agreement that
saved the North American free-trade deal faded.
    China's financial markets are closed for the week of Oct.
1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory
growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. [nZZN2NEO00]
    The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to
salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2
trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after
nearly a quarter century in operation. [nL8N1WH2Z5]  
    The trade pact helped the dollar index <.DXY> rise 0.4
percent to 95.718, its highest since Sept. 4.
    The dollar's strength weighed on the leading emerging
markets stock index <.MSCIEF>, which fell 1.5 percent - its
biggest one-day loss for a month.
    Oil prices recoiled slightly, having hit nearly four-year
highs in the previous session.
    Crude contracts had surged nearly 3 percent to $75.77 a
barrel, their highest since November 2014, as the deal to
salvage NAFTA stoked economic growth expectations, with
impending U.S. sanctions on Iran seen raising prices. [O/R]
    U.S. crude futures <CLc1>, having touched a high of $75.91,
were trading flat at $75.30 a barrel.
    Brent crude <LCOc1> edged down 0.5 percent to $84.52 a
barrel, having rallied the previous day to $85.45, its highest
since November 2014.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a six-week low on
Tuesday after a senior lawmaker in one of Italy's ruling parties
said most of the country's problems would be resolved if it
readopted a national currency, triggering a broad market
sell-off.
    The euro also slumped against the safe-haven yen and Swiss

    But that failed to ease pressure on the single currency
<EUR=>, which skidded as low as $1.1505, its weakest since Aug.
21. Against the yen, the euro lost almost one percent to 130.71
<EURJPY=> before recovering some ground, and dropped 0.6 percent

    By Francesco Guarascio
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Union needs
clearer rules to combat money laundering that would apply
equally to all EU countries, European Central Bank Vice
President Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday.
    The 28-nation bloc is grappling with high-profile cases of
money laundering at banks in member states, including Estonia,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and Latvia, which
have exposed serious gaps in the EU's framework to fight the
issue.
    ""A higher level of harmonisation of the applicable rules in
the form of a regulation should be considered,"" de Guindos told
EU finance ministers during a public debate in Luxembourg.  
    An EU regulation is directly applicable in all member
countries, but rules against money laundering are currently
defined in directives which give governments broad leeway in
their application. 
    This has resulted in different levels of enforcement and
gaps in the EU framework. Governments have long been reluctant
to give away national powers to monitor banks and fight crime.
    Many confirmed their scepticism to de Guindos's appeal and
to a European Commission plan to strengthen common supervision
against money laundering.
    Germany, the largest country in the bloc, asked for more
time to change the system. 
    Replying to de Guindos's proposal on transforming directives
into a regulation, Joerg Kukies, Germany's state secretary at
the finance ministry, said: ""We think this is not an easy thing
to do in the short term but something we would be very open to
discuss.""
    The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Estonia and Finland said more
time was required to decide which changes were needed,
confirming the sceptical line they held in a closed-door meeting
last week, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters.
    The flexibility given to states in applying money laundering
rules allows them to decide whether to expose banks that are
fined for breaches of the rules. 
    Germany and Luxembourg are among countries that refuse to
reveal all sanctioned banks, despite international guidelines
saying publicity is one of the most efficient tools to combat
money laundering.
    ""All sanction decisions should be published. The current
situation is massively unsatisfactory,"" Nicolas Veron, an
economist at Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel, said.
    
    SINGLE AGENCY
    Many states were even less supportive of the idea of setting
up a common agency to supervise financial crime at banks. 
    The ECB has openly called for such an organisation which
would mirror the monitoring it does on banks' financial
stability.
    France backed the initiative, but many states urged further
talks and Hungary opposed any proposal that would reduce
national powers. 
    The European Commission, which has proposed giving more
powers to the European Banking Authority to close the most
urgent gaps, said the meeting was positive despite the
divisions.
    ""Everybody agrees something needs to be done to strengthen
enforcement,"" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Stocks fell worldwide and European
assets sold off on Tuesday after anti-euro comments from an
Italian lawmaker dented the single currency and sent Italy's
bond yields to multi-year highs, despite attempts by the
government to backtrack.
    A boost to investors' risk appetite from the new
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact proved short-lived with the MSCI
world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> falling back 0.3 percent.
    U.S. futures traded down 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent ahead of
Wall Street's open, while PepsiCo <PEP.O> gained in pre-market
trading after reporting stronger-than-expected profit.
[nL4N1WI2CP]
    The leading index of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> lost 0.7
percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> fell 0.5 percent
as Italian assets came under renewed pressure, though the
sell-off lost steam by midday.
    The economics spokesman for Italy's ruling League party,
Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that most of the
country's problems could be solved by having its own currency. 
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new
4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German
yields to the widest for more than five years. [nL8N1WI11F]
    Shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, which have large
sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low before recovering
part of their losses.
    But Borghi and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed down,
calling the euro ""unrenounceable"", helping to calm markets and
erasing losses for Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB>.[nR1N1RB01P]
    ""While our economists do not expect systemic implications
for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,"" Goldman
Sachs analysts said.
    ""We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there
is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the
high trade exposure to Italy.""
    The euro <EUR=> fell 0.6 percent to its lowest since Aug. 21
at $1.1504, then recovered to trade down 0.3 percent at $1.1542.
    The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a
significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy's
debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European
Union's.
    ""The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great
fudges - think of the case of Greece,"" the Saracen global income
and growth fund's manager, David Keir, said. 
    ""But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading.
The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political
decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,"" he said. 
    
    DOLLAR GRINDS EMERGING MARKETS DOWN
    Asian stocks were lower as the lift from an agreement that
saved the North American free-trade deal faded.
    China's financial markets are closed for the week of Oct.
1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory
growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. [nZZN2NEO00]
    The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to
salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2
trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after
nearly a quarter century in operation. [nL8N1WH2Z5]  
    The trade pact helped the dollar index <.DXY> rise to its
highest since Aug. 21, at 95.744. It was last up 0.3 percent at
95.546.
    The dollar's strength weighed on the leading emerging
markets stock index <.MSCIEF>, which fell 1.3 percent, setting
it on course for its biggest one-day loss for a month.
    Oil prices recoiled slightly as investors took profit after
crude surged to near four-year highs in the previous session.
    Crude contracts rose to their highest since November 2014 as
the deal to salvage NAFTA stoked economic growth expectations,
with impending U.S. sanctions on Iran seen raising prices. [O/R]
    On Tuesday U.S. crude futures <CLc1>, having touched a high
of $75.91, were trading flat at $75.33 a barrel.
    Brent crude <LCOc1> edged down 0.4 percent to $84.60 a
barrel, having rallied the previous day to $85.45.

coalition to approve a scheme offering tax breaks to citizens
who buy government debt.
    The measure, put forward by members of the right-wing League
party, is aimed at helping the two-party coalition - which
includes the League - find extra resources to finance costly
measures it promised during campaigning for national elections
in March.
    Italy's debt already stands above 130 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, the highest in the euro zone
after Greece, and its ambitious budget plans have spooked
markets and set it on a collision course with EU authorities and
its euro zone partners. [nL8N1WI2PT]
    Armando Siri, Undersecretary for the Infrastructure Ministry
and League lawmaker, told Reuters the scheme envisaged up to 15
billion euros in investments in Treasury bonds and, if approved
in cabinet, would be included in a decree to be presented by
Oct. 20 alongside the 2019 budget.
    Italian families and businesses hold less than 5 percent of
the country's 2.3 trillion euro public debt, the bulk of which
is in the hands of banks and investment funds. 
    Another significant investor is the European Central Bank,
which is due to end purchase of Italian and other euro zone
sovereign debt under its stimulus programme at the end of this
year. 
    The finance ministry has expressed doubt over the legality
of a savings measure that would exclude European Union citizens,
a source close to the matter told Reuters.
    Siri said that the no EU rules would be breached since the
state would issued dedicated bonds for the new plan, adding
there would be a 3,000 euro ($3,470) per capita investment cap.

127 million euros behind its tax revenue target for 2018 at the
end of September, limiting the government's room for a more
generous budget package next week, unless, as expected, it
raises money elsewhere.
    Ireland has consistently beaten its revenue target in recent
years, even as it gradually unwinds tax increases introduced
during the financial crisis due to a rapid jobs recovery and the
benefits of being a major location for multinational companies.
    However while corporate tax receipts were 6.3 percent ahead
of target at the end of the third quarter, income tax and
value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1
percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent
underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company
tax gains.
    The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up
year-on-year, the data from the finance department showed on
Tuesday, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
    Assuming fiscal targets are met, Irish Finance Minister
Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million euros to dish out on
further tax cuts and spending increases next year, having
already committed over 2 billion through previously announced
increases in current and capital spending. 
    Donohoe is expected to find extra money through measures
under consideration including the scrapping or part scrapping of
a reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector. [nL5N1UR5SX] 
    With expenditure 0.1 percent behind where the government had
estimated it to be and up 8.9 percent year-on-year, the
exchequer recorded a deficit of 1.47 billion euros for the first
nine months of the year.
    The government expects to run a deficit of 0.2 percent of
economic output this year, although the central bank and
independent fiscal watchdog has urged it to be more prudent and
target a surplus. [nL5N1UN40V]

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year bond yield soared
to 4-1/2 year highs on Tuesday after a lawmaker said that most
of the country's problems would be solved by ditching the euro,
although reassuring comments from the government bought some
calm to a jittery market.
    Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League party, on
Tuesday clarified that the government had no intention of
leaving the euro, dialling back earlier comments on Italy's
membership of the bloc. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also said
Italy is totally committed to the currency. [nR1N1RB01S]
[nR1N1RB01P]
    In the wake of those comments, Italy's shorter dated
borrowing costs pulled back from four-month highs.
    Italy's two-year bond yield was up six bps at 1.43 percent,
comfortably below highs hit earlier in the day at 1.63 percent
<IT2YT=RR>. Five-year yields, which had jumped more than 20 bps
earlier in the session, were 9 bps higher in late trade at 2.65
percent <IT5YT=RR>.
    But further out the curve, borrowing costs remained elevated
as concerns about the fallout from Italy's 2019 budget plans
lingered.
    ""The assurances by the politicians that there are no plans
to leave the euro have reassured markets,"" said ING rates
strategist Benjamin Schroeder.
    ""But at the same time investors want to get a better handle
on what the budget means for Italy's debt sustainability.""
    Italy's 10-year government bond yield <IT10YT=RR> hit a
4-1/2 year high of 3.44 percent and held close to that level in
late trade, last up 14 bps on the day.         
    That left the gap <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR> between Italian
and German yields close to the widest in more than five years at
over 300 basis points.
    As euro zone officials warned of a return to crisis days,
the Italian/Spanish yield gap <ES10YT=RR> was at its widest over
any closing price in the last 20 years. [nL8N1WH6BL]
    The Greek/Italian yield gap fell to under 100 basis points,
its narrowest since 2009 <GR10YT=RR>. 
    Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated Italy would
not change its budget deficit targets. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""It smells clearly like the crisis days,"" said Commerzbank
strategist Christoph Rieger, referring to the euro zone debt
crisis of 2010-2012, when the breakup of the bloc was a
possibility.
    Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from
the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker comparing Italy
with Greece. [nB5N1O400K]        
    ITALIAN BANKS, EURO HIT
    The euro briefly fell to a six-week low at $1.1505 <EUR=>
after Borghi's comment.
    Shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, whose government bond
holdings make them sensitive to political developments, fell as
much as 3.9 percent to their lowest in 19 months on fears a bond
sell-off would cut their capital ratios, raise their funding
costs and hamper efforts to cut bad loans. 
    The bank index was last down 0.7 percent, having erased a
bulk of its earlier losses. Shares in Italy's largest lenders
Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, while lower,
were off multi-month lows.
    Still, the cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign
debt and the debt of the country's largest lenders rose sharply.
[nS8N1S000T]    
    The Italian government is to finalise the 2019-2021 budget
programme later on Tuesday, Di Maio said. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""Neither the EU or Italy is incentivised to compromise it
seems, at least in the opening gambit of the talks,"" said
Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset
Management.    
    He said Italy's 10-year borrowing costs could reach four
percent by the end of the year.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields fell as investors
retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such as
Germany, Netherlands and Austria. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield was last down four bps at 0.43
percent <DE10YT=RR>, while Spanish and Portuguese bond yields
<ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR> were little changed - showing no signs
of contagion from the Italy bond sell off.

    By Laila Kearney
    New York, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Stocks weakened around the globe
and European assets sold off on Tuesday as anti-euro comments by
an Italian lawmaker sent Italy's bond yields to multi-year highs
and optimism over an agreement to revamp a North American trade
deal receded.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.3
percent, paring Monday's gains due to the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada
trade deal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
lost 0.55 percent.
    Wall Street slipped at the open with bank stocks the biggest
drag, but soon regained some momentum. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average <.DJI> rose 81.53 points, or 0.31 percent, to 26,732.74,
the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.11 points, or -0.00 percent, to
2,924.48 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 8.49 points,
or 0.11 percent, to 8,028.82.
    The economics spokesman for Italy's ruling League party,
Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that most of the
country's problems could be solved by having its own currency. 
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new
4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German
yields to the widest for more than five years. [nL8N1WI11F]
    Shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, which have large
sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low before recovering
part of their losses.
   ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one
side and Italy on the other,"" Credit Agricole head of G10 FX
Strategy Valentin Marinov said. ""There's a lot of headline risk
about.""
    Borghi and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed down,
calling the euro ""unrenounceable"", helping to calm markets and
erasing losses for Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB>. [nR1N1RB01P]
    The euro <EUR=> fell to its weakest since Aug. 21 at
$1.1505, before retracing to $1.1537, down 0.34 percent on the
day. [nL2N1WI0K3]
    The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a
significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy's
debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European
Union's.
    Asian stocks were lower as the boost from the agreement to
save the North American free-trade deal faded. The deal lifted
optimism for a resolution of a trade row between the United
States and China. 
    China's financial markets are closed for the week of Oct.
1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory
growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. [nZZN2NEO00]
    The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to
salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2
trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after
nearly a quarter century in operation. [nL8N1WH2Z5]  
    The trade pact helped the dollar index <.DXY> rise to its
highest since Aug. 21, at 95.744. It was last at 0.17 percent.
    The dollar's strength weighed on the leading emerging
markets stock index <.MSCIEF>, which fell 1.3 percent, setting
it on course for its biggest one-day loss for a month.
    Gold rose as investors sought refuge in the safe-have after
equity markets weakened. Spot gold <XAU=> rose 1.6 percent to
$1,206.11 per ounce, reaching its highest point since Sept. 21.
U.S. gold futures <GCcv1> were up 1.5 percent at $1,209.20.
    Oil prices steadied near their highest since November 2014
as markets braced for tighter supply once U.S. sanctions against
Iran kick in next month. [O/R]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> fell 0.31 percent to $75.07 per barrel
and Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $84.77, down 0.25 percent on the
day.

    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Governments should not expect the
European Central Bank to let fiscal issues take precedence when
it sets its monetary policy even if financial stability is at
stake, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on
Tuesday.
    Villeroy, who is also governor of the French central bank,
did not single out Italy, but Rome's decision to ditch previous
deficit targets agreed with the European Union has put Italian
assets under pressure, raising financial stability questions. 
    ""There can be no fiscal dominance and no influence of any
national fiscal policy on our common monetary policy,"" Villeroy,
who is also governor of the Bank of France, told a conference in
Paris.
    He added that ECB policymakers' primary mandate was to
guarantee price stability in the euro zone and that financial
stability had to be ensured through regulatory measures.
    Financial market angst about Italy, which has weighed on the
euro and has sparked a spike in Italian bond yields, is focused
on the country's vast debt burden. [nL8N1WI11F]

 (Recasts on deficit target, upgrade of GDP forecasts)
    By Padraic Halpin
    DUBLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ireland expects to hit its budget
deficit target of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product this
year after a sharp hike to its economic growth forecast offset
overspending in some areas and a slightly weaker than
anticipated tax take.
    Ireland's finance department increased its forecast for GDP
growth this year to 7.4 percent from a previous estimate of 5.6
percent and nudged up its projection for next year to 4.2
percent from the 4.0 percent forecast six months ago.
    Irish GDP has outperformed everywhere in Europe since 2014
but the relevance of using the conventional measure of growth
has diminished after a series of distortions related to
Ireland's large multinational sector that hit again this year,
leading to first half growth of 9.1 percent. [nS8N1SB01Z]
    ""We expect to come in bang on the nose in and around a
deficit of 0.2 percent this year as projected, with the good
things being counteracted by overruns in other areas,"" Prime
Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament.
    The main overspending at the end of the third quarter was
again in the health department which was running 301 million
euros or 2.7 percent above profile, data from the finance
department showed on Tuesday.
    While total spending was 0.1 percent behind where the
government had estimated, the money set aside for departments
and capital projects is typically spent by the end of the year.
    The exchequer also remained 0.3 percent or 127 million euros
behind its tax revenue target for 2018 at the end of September,
which analysts said did little to change the arithmetic for next
Tuesday's presentation of the budget for 2019.
    While corporate tax receipts were 6.3 percent ahead of
target at the end of the third quarter, income tax and
value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1
percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent
underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company
tax gains.
    The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up
year-on-year, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
    Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million
euros to dish out on further tax cuts and spending increases
next year, having already committed over 2 billion through
previously announced increases in current and capital spending. 
    Donohoe is expected to find extra money through measures
under consideration including the scrapping or part-scrapping of
a reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector, although he is also
under pressure from the country's central bank to target a
budget surplus next year instead of the planned minor deficit.
[nL5N1UR5SX] 
    ""With Brexit uncertainties looming, it remains to be seen
whether the minister will aim for a cautious budget, eschewing
large giveaways, in favour of a more ambitious target for a
surplus,"" Davy Stockbrokers chief economist Conall MacCoille
wrote in a note.

to its lenders from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the
International Monetary Fund before they are due in a bid to cut
its debt servicing costs, its finance minister said on Tuesday.
    Greece, whose public debt amounts to 180 percent of its
gross domestic product, has received loans totalling about 280
billion euros under three international bailouts since 2010.
    The ECB holds about 12 billion euros worth of Greek debt
with an average maturity of four years and the IMF about 10
billion euros with an average maturity of three years.
    ""We have plans to pay the IMF and the ECB earlier and, you
know, this is a kind of restructuring because we swap expensive
debt for cheap debt,"" Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told
Greek state television.
    He said Athens, which emerged from its bailout in August,
could use part of a substantial cash buffer it has built with
its lenders to repay the ECB and the IMF debt.
    The buffer, which totals about 24 billion euros, covers
Greece's needs for at least two years.  
    Shut out of bond markets in 2010 after its debt crisis
erupted, Greece has been tiptoeing back and Tsakalotos said it
was in a position to decide when it would issue new debt thanks
to that cash buffer. 
    He added there was convergence with the lenders on Greece's
bid to revoke painful pension cuts mandated for next year.

    New York, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Stock indexes around the globe
weakened on Tuesday, European assets sold off and Italy's bond
yields hit multiyear highs after an Italian lawmaker made
anti-euro comments, though Wall Street's blue-chip index bucked
the trend and set a new record.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.33
percent, paring Monday's gains that followed the new
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index <.FTEU3> lost 0.57 percent.

close at 7,999.55.
    In Italy, the economics spokesman for the country's ruling
League party, Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that
most of the country's problems could be solved by having its own
currency.  [nR1N1VZ00K]
    His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new
4-1/2-year high, pushing the yield spread between Italian debt
and German Bunds to their widest in over five years.

    By Shinichi Saoshiro
    TOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro pulled ahead from a
six-week low on Wednesday after a report that Italy plans to
reduce its budget deficit in the coming years provided some
relief to the battered currency.
    The euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.1585 <EUR=> following its
descent to $1.1505 overnight, its lowest since Aug. 21.
    The single currency got some support after Italian newspaper
Corriere della sera reported that Rome aims to gradually reduce
its budget deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2021.
    The Italian government, in a tripling of its predecessor's
target, had last week set out a deficit goal of 2.4 percent of
GDP for the next three years, unnerving markets and prompting
criticism from European Commission officials.
    ""The euro was lifted, as the latest report on Italy's budget
appears to have prompted a bit of short covering following its
recent descent on budget woes,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at
FPG Securities in Tokyo.
    ""The market was relieved amid signs that perhaps Italy was
willing to play by the rules. The Italian budget could recede as
a market theme going forward, but that won't mean the euro can
regain its stride, with the dollar enjoying such an yield
advantage,"" Fukaya added.
    The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies
was 0.25 percent lower at 95.288 <.DXY> after scaling 95.744
overnight, its highest since Sept. 4.
    The yen, another safe-haven currency, also dipped against
peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian dollar.
    The greenback was up 0.15 percent at 113.79 yen <JPY=>,

    ""U.S. data due later today such as the non-manufacturing ISM
index and Friday's jobs report will provide a chance to see if

Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in
Tokyo.
    Ishikawa said the dollar has benefited from recent euro
weakness but that fundamental factors fortified after the Fed's
rate hike has played a larger role in the greenback's advance.
    The dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since last
Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as
expected and said it foresees another rate hike in December,
three more next year and one in 2020.
    The pound was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2995 <GBP=D4> after

and instant retail payment system to stop overseas competitors
taking this market and the European Central Bank should consider
taking a bigger role in the field, ECB board member Yves Mersch
said on Wednesday.
    Instant payment systems are already in place from mobile
payment services to point-of-sale payments but most are limited
in their geographic reach, leaving PayPal and big American IT
firms dominating the market.
    ""Payment service providers around Europe need to start
offering their customers instant payment services. And they need
to do so quickly,"" Mersch told a conference in Riga.
    ""To promote euro area-wide, smooth and efficient payment
systems in line with our mandate, we might even have to reflect
on whether broader access to central bank accounts for retail
purposes may be needed,"" he added.
    Such a system would only work if it is truly pan-European,
instant, cheap and not restricted to a particular group of
clients, Mersch added.
    PayPal now dominates the European market for online payments
but players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Chinese
giants like Alibaba and Tencent are also taking market share.
    Mersch added that ultimately it will be the responsibility
of each service provider to gain the necessary size but noted
that the November launch of the ECB's instant payment system
between banks, called TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, could
provide a foundation.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - After last year's disastrous
performance (remember the coughing fit and the disintegrating
stage decor?), Britain's Theresa May looks set to play it safe
with her keynote speech to party conference today. According to
pre-released extracts, she will make a plain-vanilla pitch based
around Brexit being a ""moment of opportunity"" to Britain, while
attacking Jeremy Corbyn's Labour for being too radical. That is
unlikely to generate wild excitement after Boris Johnson stole
the headlines yesterday with a speech specifically designed to
get Tory juices flowing, but it will likely be sufficient to
stave off leadership questions for now. The creeping threat to
May comes from her Northern Irish DUP allies who are getting
worried that she is preparing to sell them down the river to get
a Brexit deal. They are out this morning reiterating that they
would never accept an arrangement in which Northern Ireland was
put on a different regulatory footing to the rest of the UK.
    New details emerging this morning on Italy's budget plans
show the government is promising over three years to shave the
deficit down from 2.4 percent of GDP next year to two percent in
2021. That has calmed financial markets somewhat and presumably
it is also an effort to reassure Brussels - despite still not
chipping away at Rome's accumulated debt load. Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte is due to meet key ministers to discuss the
budget targets for 2019-2021 at around 1100 GMT, sources said.
    NATO defence ministers will discuss military spending and
the alliance's readiness to face down any threat from Russia at
a meeting today in Brussels. Ahead off the talks, the United
States signalled it would announce in the coming days that it
will use cyber capabilities to combat similar tactics by Russia.
Baltic and British security officials say they have intelligence
showing persistent Russian cyber hacks to try to bring down
European energy and telecommunications networks, coupled with
internet disinformation campaigns. But in Europe, the issue of
deploying malware and other tools is sensitive because
governments do not want to be seen to be using the same tactics
as Vladimir Putin.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
    World markets are absorbing a bit more optimism about
Italy’s budget overnight and a little less about the
reconstituted NAFTA trade pact. After a turbulent start to the
week for Italian government bonds, sovereign yields retreated
sharply from 4-1/2 year highs set on Tuesday after reports that
the government’s proposed budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
for next year would be followed by 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent
targets for the subsequent two years. The reports have taken the
edge off worries about the higher-than-expected 2.4 percent
figure for 2019, which many had assumed would be sustained over
the three years and risk boosting overall debt/GDP levels if
many investors see as optimistic growth assumptions fail to be
realized. Ten-year Italian sovereign yields fell 9 basis points
to 3.34 percent first thing, euro/dollar rallied back close to
$1.16 and European stock futures were up more than half a
percent. An increasingly angry war of words between Italian
leaders and other European Union officials and finance ministers
is keeping markets on edge, not least amid public comments on
the desirability of Italy leaving the euro by senior coalition
figures – comments which forced the Prime Minister on Tuesday to
insist Italy’s membership of single currency was irrevocable. 
    The more positive mood in Europe was in contrast to more
downbeat markets elsewhere, with ebullience over the renewed
U.S. trade pact with Canada and Mexico offset by jitters about
embedded clauses that would effectively give Washington a veto
over subsequent free trade agreements between Canada and Mexico
and non-‘market’ economies, such as China. Even though Shanghai
markets are closed for the week, Japan’s Nikkei, HK’s Hang Seng
and other regional bourses closed in the red. Fresh dollar
strength this week against many emerging market currencies has
seen Indonesia’s rupiah hit a new 20-year low and India’s rupee
hit another record low earlier today. Turkey’s lira was slightly
weaker first thing Wednesday ahead of September inflation
numbers. The lawyer for U.S. evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson
filed an appeal to Turkey's constitutional court for his release
from house arrest, according to broadcaster CNN Turk. Wall St
stocks was more mixed overnight. Even though the Dow Jones index
set another record closing high on the weekend trade news, the
S&P500 and Nasdaq slipped back and Facebook slipped again by
almost 2 percent amid nerves about last week’s huge data breach.
Brent crude oil prices hovered close to this week's 4-year highs
above $85 per barrel.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded on Wednesday
after reports that Italy plans to reduce its budget deficit over
the next three years, but traders said the rally could be
short-lived.
    Uncertainty surrounding Italy's debt, fiscal plans and
future ties with Europe have unnerved markets recently and
exacerbated tensions with other euro zone leaders.
    The euro has suffered as a result, and on Tuesday it slid to
a six-week low after a senior lawmaker's suggested that Italy
should re-adopt a national currency, prompting a broad market
sell-off [nL8N1WI2V7].
    The single currency regained some ground on Wednesday after
Italian newspapers said Rome aims to gradually reduce its budget
deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product in 2021
[nI6N1VP01Z].
    ""That the Italian government is trying to appease its EU
partners can be seen as a step in the right direction and
therefore justifies some euro-positive reaction,"" said Thu Lan
Nguyen, a FX strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
    ""The devil is in the details. The euro's recovery will only
continue if the new fiscal plans are also feasible,"" she said.
    The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.1578 <EUR=EBS> following
its descent to $1.1505 overnight, its lowest since Aug. 21.
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will meet ministers
over the budget at around 1100 GMT on Wednesday.
    Other analysts are less sanguine about the euro.
    ""When was the last time you ever heard anybody question the
integrity of any other G8 currency?"" said CMC Markets' chief
analyst, Michael Hewson. 
    ""The fact that [Italian] politicians feel the need to
constantly reiterate this line speaks to a fundamental weakness
at the heart of the single-currency area,"" he said. 
    The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies
was 0.2 percent lower at 95.313 <.DXY> after scaling 95.744
overnight, its highest since Sept. 4.
    The yen and the Swiss franc, both safe-haven currencies, 
dipped against peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian
dollar.
    ""U.S. data due later today, such as the non-manufacturing
ISM index, will provide a chance to see if the economy is
performing in line with the Fed's views,"" said Junichi Ishikawa,
senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
    Ishikawa said the dollar has benefited from recent euro
weakness but that fundamental factors after the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates last month had played a larger role. The
dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since the Fed moved
last Wednesday and said it foresees another rate hike in
December.

previously forecast and at a lower pace than expected by the
coalition government next year, the national employers' lobby
Confindustria said on Wednesday.
   The lobby estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) next
year would expand 0.9 percent, down from a previous projection
of 1.1 percent, and almost half the 1.6 percent the Rome
executive has said it will put in its three-year budget plan.   
    Confindustria also cut its 2018 GDP forecast growth to 1.1
percent from the 1.3 percent it had estimated in June.
    The group said its downward revision was linked to the
changes in US trade policy and to turbulence in emerging
economies such as Turkey and Argentina, as well as the end of
the European Central Bank's quantitative easing and the rise in
Italian bond yields.

deficit and maintain labour market reforms to resist future
shocks as downside risks to the economy build, the International

    MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Spain should rein in its debt and
deficit and maintain labour market reforms to resist future
shocks as downside risks to the economy build, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday.
    The IMF trimmed its forecast for 2018 growth in the euro
zone's fourth-largest economy to 2.7 percent, in line with the
Socialist government's expectations, from the 2.8 percent
forecast it made in April.
    The Spanish economy is showing signs of flagging after 19
consecutive quarters of growth, but is still on track to remain
among the fastest growing in Europe. [nL5N1VR5MP]    
    ""At this juncture, it is critical to strengthen the
economy's resilience to withstand shocks,"" the IMF said in the
concluding statement of its 2018 report on Spain. 
    ""Two policy areas are key for this goal: restarting
structural fiscal adjustment and preserving the thrust of the
labour market reforms"" introduced by the previous conservative
government, it added.
    Debt levels have only come down marginally while the economy
has grown strongly, making the government's aim to cut the
deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP for 2019 ""critical and
appropriate"", the IMF said. 
    It urged the government to preserve the thrust of the 2012
labour market reform, which included wage flexibility that ""has
underpinned Spain's job-rich economic recovery and regained
competitiveness"".   
    A sustainable and comprehensive pension package is also
needed to address current tensions in the system, the IMF said.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro was lifted on Wednesday
by reports that Italy plans to reduce its budget deficit over
the next three years, but traders said the gains could be
fleeting.
    Uncertainty surrounding Italy's debt, fiscal plans and
future ties with Europe have unnerved markets and exacerbated
tensions with other euro zone leaders.
    This has hit the euro, which on Tuesday slid to a six-week
low after a senior lawmaker said that Italy should re-adopt a
national currency, prompting a broad market sell-off
[nL8N1WI2V7].
    The single currency regained some poise after a government
source on Wednesday said Rome aims to gradually reduce its
budget deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product in 2021
[nL8N1WJ0RJ].
    ""That the Italian government is trying to appease its EU
partners can be seen as a step in the right direction and
therefore justifies some euro-positive reaction,"" said Thu Lan
Nguyen, a FX strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
    ""The devil is in the details. The euro's recovery will only
continue if the new fiscal plans are also feasible,"" she said.
    The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.1561 <EUR=EBS> at 1030 GMT
following a drop to $1.1505 overnight, its lowest since Aug. 21.
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will meet ministers
over the budget at around 1100 GMT on Wednesday.
    Other analysts are less sanguine about the euro.
    ""When was the last time you ever heard anybody question the
integrity of any other G8 currency?"" said CMC Markets' chief
analyst, Michael Hewson. 
    ""The fact that [Italian] politicians feel the need to
constantly reiterate this line speaks to a fundamental weakness
at the heart of the single-currency area,"" he said. 
    The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies
was 0.1 percent lower at 95.425 <.DXY> after scaling 95.744
overnight, its highest since Sept. 4.
    The yen and the Swiss franc, both safe-haven currencies, 
struggled against peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian
dollar.
    ""U.S. data due later today, such as the non-manufacturing
ISM index, will provide a chance to see if the economy is
performing in line with the Fed's views,"" said Junichi Ishikawa,
senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
    Ishikawa said the dollar has benefited from recent euro
weakness but that fundamental factors after the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates last month had played a larger role. The
dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since the Fed moved
last Wednesday and said it foresees another rate hike in
December.
    The pound was 0.2 percent lower at $1.2995 <GBP=D3> after
dropping on Tuesday to $1.2941, its weakest since Sept. 10, as
conflicts over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan
escalated [nL8N1WH6ZA].
    The Australian dollar was down half a percent at $0.7150
<AUD=D4>, a two-week low.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - As bond investors stress about
Italy's budget plans, key market gauges of euro break-up risks
are starting to flicker -- but to a far lesser degree than they
did just a few months ago.
    Italy's government appears set for a clash with the European
Union, given its spending plans for 2019 and beyond.
[nL8N1WI14R]
    Italy's 10-year bond yield hit 4 1/2-year highs on Tuesday
<IT10YT=RR>, gaining momentum after a lawmaker said most of
Italy's problems would be solved if it ditched the euro. 
    But in contrast to the brutal May selloff, market gauges
reflecting risks of Italy leaving the euro zone -- a possibility
market players dub ""Quitaly"" or ""Italexit"" -- are flickering
rather than flashing.
        
    1. CDS VS CDS 
    Italian credit default swaps (CDS), derivatives used to
protect against exposure to a default, are considered more
likely to pay out in event of ""Quitaly"", if the contract was
drawn up according to 2014 guidelines instead of earlier 2003
rules.
    Therefore, the difference between how the two types of CDS
trade is one gauge of whether markets are positioning for
redenomination. 
    While the gap between the two contracts has spread, it
remains below the width reached in May, when markets were roiled
by fears of a snap election that could become a de facto
referendum on the euro.
    ""It's clearly not as bad as May. Italy doesn't want to leave
the euro,"" said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at
Futures First Info Services.
    
    
    2. CACS IN THE CRADLE
    How investors trade Italian bonds issued before and after
2013 is also telling. 
    That year, regulators introduced new rules stipulating that
European government bond contracts contain collective action
clauses (CACs). This means that majority bondholder approval is
needed for a restructuring, including a change in the currency
of payment. 
    In late May, bonds issued before 2013 – and therefore
without CAC protection – sold off more sharply than debt issued
after 2013; for example, the yield gap between Italy's March
2022 bond issued in September 2011 and an April 2022 bond was 10
basis points.    
    
   Since then, the two issues have traded in lock-step, although
this week has seen some signs of slight preference for the 2017
issue, suggesting a ""Quitaly"" premium may be creeping back.
    
    3. NEW YORK OR ROME?
    During the May rout, Italy's two dollar-denominated bonds
maturing 2023 and 2033 outperformed their locally-issued, euro
denominated peers, as bonds governed by New York law offer
stronger protection against restructuring, including currency
redenomination.
    However, yields on both types of bonds have risen since
Italy delivered its budget deficit proposal last week.
    
    There are perhaps two explanations for this. 
    First, while the budget deficit forecast was higher than
expected, it did not breach the 3 percent limit mandated by the
EU, which would have raised questions about Italy's commitment
to the euro. 
    Second, overall rhetoric from top officials reaffirms
Italy's commitment to the euro [nR1N1RB01S].
    ""We think the key worry for markets right now is not an
‘Italexit’, but the impact from a wider fiscal deficit on
Italy's debt sustainability, especially given the backdrop of a
fast-approaching end to ECB QE,"" said TS Lombard senior
economist Shweta Singh.
    
    4. INFLATION STATION
    Italy issues inflation-linked bonds, some pegged to euro
zone inflation and others to Italian prices. 
    Demand for bonds pegged to euro zone consumer prices should
have more demand than those linked to domestic prices because
Italy's economic growth and inflation lag the bloc. 
    But that doesn't hold if a possible redenomination comes
into play, because a new Italian currency would probably fall,
fuelling inflation.
    So buying Italian inflation is a clean hedge for
redenomination risk. In May, yields and break-even levels on
Italy's May 2023 bond pegged to euro zone inflation and May 2023
bond pegged to Italian inflation were almost identical.
<IT525367=> <IT532934=> 
    In September, when hopes were for a market-friendly budget, 
the spread between the real yield of the two bonds widened to
nearly 30 basis points. It has now narrowed back to just 6 bps.
    
    5. LOVING THE SCHATZ
    German two-year government bonds -- the Schatz -- are a
favourite with investors nervous about a euro zone break-up.
    Bonds from top-rated Germany, the euro zone's biggest
economy, are viewed as some of the safest assets in the world.  
    Short-dated bonds also tend to benefit from near-term risks
and are seen by some as a proxy for the how the deutsche mark
would trade should it return. 
    The Schatz yield hit a one-month low at almost minus 0.60
percent <DE2YT=RR> on Tuesday as Italian bonds sold off.     
    In May, two-year yields tumbled far more, hitting one-year
lows, slid to record lows ahead of French elections last year
and dived after Britain's Brexit vote in 2016.
    ""This does seem to be seen as an Italian-specific issue
rather than a systemic issue for Europe,"" said David Zahn, head
of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The dollar strengthened against
other major currencies on Wednesday after a top U.S. policymaker
said inflation expectations haven't gone up as much as he would
have liked and he was comfortable with a December rate hike.
    Federal Reserve policymaker Charles Evans's comments cut the
euro's fledgling rally short after it was lifted earlier by
reports that Italy plans to reduce its budget deficit over the
next three years.
    Evans said getting U.S. interest rates up to ""a slightly
restrictive setting"" of 3.0 or 3.25 percent would be consistent
with the strong U.S. economy and its inflation rate.
[nL9N1UT04N]
    The greenback edged 0.05 percent higher at 95.56 <=USD>
against its rivals and erased its losses against the euro which
had gained in early London trading.

at the heart of the single-currency area,"" he said. 
    The yen and the Swiss franc, both safe-haven currencies, 
struggled against peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian
dollar.
    ""U.S. data due later today, such as the non-manufacturing
ISM index, will provide a chance to see if the economy is
performing in line with the Fed's views,"" said Junichi Ishikawa,
senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
    Ishikawa said the dollar has benefited from recent euro
weakness but that fundamental factors after the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates last month had played a larger role. The
dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since the Fed moved
last Wednesday and said it foresees another rate hike in
December.
    The pound was 0.4 percent lower at $1.2963 <GBP=D3> after
dropping on Tuesday to $1.2941, its weakest since Sept. 10, as
conflicts over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan
escalated [nL8N1WH6ZA].
    The Australian dollar was down half a percent at $0.7150
<AUD=D4>, a two-week low.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - European Union banks should be
allowed to continue using British clearing houses for
derivatives transactions even under a no-deal Brexit, a top EU
regulator said on Wednesday, in an effort  to quell rising
concern in markets.
    With just six months to go until Brexit, Britain and the EU 
have still not agreed a divorce settlement that would include a
""standstill"" transition period from March until the end of 2020.
    Cross-border banks fear that if Britain crashes out of the
bloc, they could no longer use LCH, a unit of the London Stock
Exchange <LSE.L> that clears about 90 percent of
euro-denominated interest rate swaps. There is too little time
to move contracts from LCH to EU rivals before March.
    LCH can't apply for EU authorisation as a foreign clearing
house or central counterparty (CCP) until after Britain has left
the EU, meaning a potentially destabilising legal hiatus looms.
    ""To respond to those risks to the stability of EU financial
markets, in my view we need to ensure continued access to UK
CCPs for EU clearing members and trading venues,"" Steven
Maijoor, chair of the bloc's European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA) said.
    It is the clearest signal yet that LCH in London would not
face a problem obtaining EU authorisation. Scott O'Malia, chief
executive of global derivatives industry body ISDA, called last
week for such authorisation to be a matter of urgency.
    Faced with a critical part of its financial system's
plumbing being based outside the bloc, Brussels has proposed
tougher supervision of foreign clearers if they want EU market
access.
    Maijoor urged ""swift"" approval of the draft law,
""complemented by a transitional provision allowing for the
continued access to UK-based CCPs"".
    LCH had no comment on Maijoor's speech to an audience of
stock exchange executives in Athens.
    Tim Cant, a financial regulatory partner at Ashurst law
firm, said ESMA's backing for speedy action regarding British
clearing houses would put an end to the ""melodrama"" that has
surrounded EU pronouncements on the matter.
    In another safeguard against disruption from a no-deal
Brexit, Maijoor said there would be ""memorandums of
understanding"" (MOU) with British regulators, allowing them to
continue swapping information, crucial for enforcement cases.
    ""Taking the wider negotiations between the EU and UK into
account, we plan to start negotiations with the UK Financial
Conduct Authority with the objective to have these MOUs in place
sufficiently on time before the end of March 2019,"" Maijoor
said.

    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, according to the
country's central bank.
    The European Union member country has been rocked by
revelations that banks there laundered money from Russia,
Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank accounts. The
scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and neighbouring Latvia to
shut down.
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all flows, including resident and
non-resident transactions, a spokesman said. 
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the flows suspicious.
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident, cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    A central bank spokesman told Reuters the bank does not have
specific data for non-resident transactions.
    Nordic banking shares fell after the Bloomberg report.
Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking operations in
Estonia, were trading 5.4 percent and 7.2 percent lower,
respectively.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market.
Swedbank declined to comment.
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

columnist for Reuters.)
    By Jamie McGeever
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The new Italian government's
latest budget proposals have caused consternation in markets and
irritation in Brussels - yet many at the heart of euro
policymaking will quietly feel a dose of market discipline is a
precisely what's needed to rein Rome in.
    Let the bond vigilantes loose, is how thinking goes. A surge
in Italian government borrowing costs and steep drop in the
country's banking stocks have the power to change even the most
ambitious budget mathematics and force Italy's coalition leaders
to roll back their plans.
    ""If they do crazy things, let the market play its role.
Market discipline exists, as we have seen,"" one policymaker put
it recently.
    Sounds good in theory. But it may also be a case of ""careful
what you wish for"". At what point does market discipline in
Italy and its related political fallout infect the rest of the
euro area and undermine the single currency? 
    A paper by Guido Tabellini, professor of economics at
Bocconi University, published by the Centre for Economic Policy
Research in July, found that efforts to impose market discipline
work ""very imperfectly"", even if the economic fundamentals are
relatively sound.
    ""The larger the outstanding debt, the higher the risk that
market discipline degenerates into a debt run,"" Tabellini wrote,
and a crisis of confidence in one euro zone country was likely
to spread to others. 
    ""The resilience of the euro area is not much higher than
that of its weakest member. For this reason, reforms that
increase the vulnerabilities of the weaker countries may be
counter-productive for all,"" he found.
    Italy's economic fundamentals are not particularly sound,
and its outstanding debt is huge. While there's been relatively
little spillover to date from the turmoil in Italian markets,
the recent history of euro crises shows it's dangerous to assume
that will remain the case indefinitely.
    The scars of 2010-2012 are healing but run deep. 
    Greece - with an economy almost a tenth the size of Italy's
- was the epicentre of that euro crisis. And yet the financial
contagion associated with risk of an unprecedented euro exit
ripped through Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal - eventually
forcing ECB president Mario Draghi to do ""whatever it takes"" and
fire up the bank's money printing presses to calm the storm.
    Italian bond yields hit 7.45 percent in 2011 and the spread
over Germany topped 550 basis points. We're not back there yet,
but the 10-year yield is near 3.50 percent and the spread over
Germany is 300 bps, both the highest in years.
    Since Italy's general election in May, the country's stock
market has lost 18 percent and bank stocks have plunged 30
percent. Wider contagion has been pretty limited, but at this
stage it cannot be blindly dismissed.
    
    SPILLOVER
    Goldman Sachs has constructed a model that shows that since
2010, on days when there's been an equivalent 100 bps rise in
Italian yields, Spanish yields rise by around 40 bps, while
safe-haven flows push German yields down by around 20 bps.
    In equities, this results in Spanish, French and German
markets falling 3.5 to 5 percent, and U.S., UK and Japanese
stocks falling between 2 and 3 percent. 
    More broadly, Spanish financial conditions tighten by around
40 bps, and U.S., UK and Japanese conditions tighten by around
20 bps. Thanks to the fall in the euro's exchange rate and Bund
yields, German financial conditions ease by around 15 bps.
    
    
    
    
    Spillovers in the 2010-13 period were obviously greater than
the years since, but the analysis shows that meaningful moves in
Italian bonds do move other markets. Some more than others.
    Given how heavily invested Italian banks are in the
country's sovereign bonds, the correlation between BTP futures
and euro zone banking stocks is particularly strong.
    This week, the simple daily correlation between the two
reached 0.76, matching levels seen in May and closing in on the
crisis peaks of 0.85 to 0.90 in 2011 and 2012. The highest
possible correlation between two asset classes or markets is
1.0.
    

    At the root of the current volatility is the budget standoff
between Rome and Brussels. Italian government sources told
Reuters on Wednesday that next year's deficit target remains 2.4
percent of gross domestic product, falling to 2 percent in 2021,
maybe even lower. 
    But growth in Italy has been chronically low for years,
nowhere near strong enough to prevent the country's debt-to-GDP
ratio from rising. Are these forecasts enough to bring the ratio
down to a rate acceptable to Brussels? 
    Punishment from Brussels over the deficit might not keep
Italian politicians up at night, but market forces would. Rising
bond yields would damage growth even more, and the perfect storm
of weak growth and higher debt funding costs could push the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 130 pct even higher. 
    That would bring the rating agencies back into play. Italy
could be downgraded, maybe even by three notches to junk. ""The
wider connotations of falling down this path don't bear thinking
about,"" says Steve Barrow at Standard Bank.

    The scale of the cross-border flows, first report by

Baltic country may have been larger then previously thought. The
news sent Nordic banking shares sharply lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27

    Estonia's entire GDP is only about $23 billion.

    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Danish expert on money
laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates that the
Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the problem related
to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 5.4 percent and 7.2 percent
lower, respectively.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,

annual report.

7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.

European Union legislators a document in which he proposes a

    Savona, who was the Italian government's original pick as

    Savona was likely referring to a document he posted on his

    In that paper he called for the public debt of all euro zone
states to be brought below 60 percent of gross domestic product,
via long-term restructuring underwritten by the European Central
Bank [nL8N1W54SJ].
    At more than 130 percent of its economic output, Italy has
the second largest debt ratio of the bloc, after bailed-out
Greece. 
    Speaking to reporters after meetings with EU legislators in
the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Savona also said he
wanted the establishment of a European school ""to build

    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, according to the
country's central bank.
    The European Union member country of just 1.3 million people
has been rocked by revelations that banks there laundered money
from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank
accounts. The scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and
neighbouring Latvia to shut down.
    The data on cross-border flows, first reported by Bloomberg,
suggests that the scale of the money laundering through the
small Baltic country may have been larger then previously
thought. The news sent Nordic banking shares sharply lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all flows, including resident and
non-resident transactions, a spokesman said. 
    Estonia's entire economic output came to about $25 billion
last year - roughly the same as that of Uganda or Nepal -
suggesting that much of the money flow was not directly linked
to economic activity in the country.
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the flows suspicious. 
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    The central bank later said the figure in the Bloomberg
report doesn't relate specifically to non-resident transactions
but to all flows in and out of the country, including imports
and exports and routine financial transactions such as
securities purchases. 
    Estonia's imports and exports totalled 232 billion euros
between 2008 and 2017, official data showed. 
    The central bank said in a statement that non-resident flows
""only make up one part of the sum,"" adding that it does not
collect separate data for those transactions.
    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Copenhagen-based expert
on money laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates
that the Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the
problem related to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 3.3 percent and 5.8 percent
lower, respectively. The region's biggest bank Nordea was
trading 2.9 percent lower, while Danske Bank, whose shares have
lost one-third of their value since March, was down 1.5 percent.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,
according to its website. 
    Its Nordic rival SEB <SEBa.ST> also has major operations in
the Baltics after acquisitions in the late 1990s. It had 920,000
private and 99,000 corporate customers according to its 2017

    STRASBOURG, Oct 3 (Reuters) - There is ""no chance"" of Italy
defaulting on its debts and the country is very different from
Greece, Italy's minister for European affairs was quoted on
Wednesday as telling EU lawmakers.
    Paolo Savona was speaking after presenting a document to
Italian lawmakers in the European Parliament in which he
proposes a review of the EU's monetary and fiscal policy.
    ""I think there is no chance that Italy will default on its
public debt,"" Savona said, according to a person who attended
the meeting.
    Italy has the second largest debt in the European Union as a
proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) after Greece,
which has received three multi-billion-euro bailouts over the
past few years. Italy's debt exceeds 130 percent of GDP.
    Italy's populist-led government said last week it planned to
run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP next year, tripling the
previous government's target.
    After the announcement triggered a sell-off in Italian
assets and EU criticism, Rome said on Wednesday it would cut its
deficit from 2020.
    Savona, who was his government's original pick as economy
minister but vetoed by Italy's president due to his critical
opinion of the euro, said he had presented to EU lawmakers a
document in which he proposed ""to reassess the European monetary
and fiscal policy in an integrated manner"".
    Savona was referring to a document he posted on his

    In that paper he called for the public debt of all euro zone
states to be brought below 60 percent of gross domestic product,
via long-term restructuring underwritten by the European Central
Bank [nL8N1W54SJ].
    Savona also said Italy was very different from Greece, in an
apparent reaction to remarks made by European Commission
President Jean-Claude Juncker.
    Juncker warned Rome this week against following a fiscal
policy that he said could cause a financial crisis like the one
experienced by Greece over the past few years [nB5N1O400K].

    TIRANA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Albania's central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate at the historic low of 1 percent on
Wednesday and signalled there would be no change before next
April.
    Speaking after the bank's board meeting, Governor Gent Sejko
said they had also kept unchanged the rates on one-day deposit
and lending rates respectively at 0.1 and 1.9 percent.
    ""The supervisory board believes... the normalisation of
interest rates in the internal financial market will not start
before the second trimester of 2019,"" Sejko told reporters.
    The bank has steadily cut the benchmark rate since 2008,
from 6.25 percent to the current level of 1 percent, to spur
lending and growth as it seeks to hit its annual inflation
target of 3 percent.
    Albania's economy grew by 4.3 percent in the first half of
2018 and a similar trend was observed in the third quarter,
Sejko said.
    Growth came from private spending and investment, exports
and electricity production in the first quarter, helped by an
improving international economic environment.
    Sejko said monetary stimulus would be needed to guarantee
stable growth in the medium term, adding that the intensity of
the stimulus would diminish in line with the growth performance 
and the speed with which inflation returns to target.
    He said the bank saw inflation, which was slightly higher on
an annual basis at 2.3 and 2.2 percent in July and August
respectively, hitting the 3 percent annual target in 2020.
    ""This dynamic (of inflation) will be backed by the continued
expansion of aggregate demand, leading to higher employment,
wages and profit margins,"" Sejko said.
    Sejko said the board thought that demand and supply for hard
currency, mostly euros, were stable and the appreciation of the
lek to the euro represented ""a lower threat to inflation"". 
    The euro fell to its lowest level to the lek in 10 years in
June before the bank intervened to buy euros. At the end of the
tourism season, Sejko said the demand and supply ratio for hard
currency was ""balanced"" although the bank had not intervened.

    By Jamie McGeever
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The new Italian government's
latest budget proposals have caused consternation in markets and
irritation in Brussels - yet many at the heart of euro
policymaking will quietly feel a dose of market discipline is a
precisely what's needed to rein Rome in.
    Let the bond vigilantes loose, is how thinking goes. A surge
in Italian government borrowing costs and steep drop in the
country's banking stocks have the power to change even the most
ambitious budget mathematics and force Italy's coalition leaders
to roll back their plans.
    ""If they do crazy things, let the market play its role.
Market discipline exists, as we have seen,"" one policymaker put
it recently.
    Sounds good in theory. But it may also be a case of ""careful
what you wish for"". At what point does market discipline in
Italy and its related political fallout infect the rest of the
euro area and undermine the single currency? 
    A paper by Guido Tabellini, professor of economics at
Bocconi University, published by the Centre for Economic Policy
Research in July, found that efforts to impose market discipline
work ""very imperfectly"", even if the economic fundamentals are
relatively sound.
    ""The larger the outstanding debt, the higher the risk that
market discipline degenerates into a debt run,"" Tabellini wrote,
and a crisis of confidence in one euro zone country was likely
to spread to others. 
    ""The resilience of the euro area is not much higher than
that of its weakest member. For this reason, reforms that
increase the vulnerabilities of the weaker countries may be
counter-productive for all,"" he found.
    Italy's economic fundamentals are not particularly sound,
and its outstanding debt is huge. While there's been relatively
little spillover to date from the turmoil in Italian markets,
the recent history of euro crises shows it's dangerous to assume
that will remain the case indefinitely.
    The scars of 2010-2012 are healing but run deep. 
    Greece - with an economy almost a tenth the size of Italy's
- was the epicentre of that euro crisis. And yet the financial
contagion associated with risk of an unprecedented euro exit
ripped through Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal - eventually
forcing ECB president Mario Draghi to do ""whatever it takes"" and
fire up the bank's money printing presses to calm the storm.
    Italian bond yields hit 7.45 percent in 2011 and the spread
over Germany topped 550 basis points. We're not back there yet,
but the 10-year yield is near 3.50 percent and the spread over
Germany is 300 bps, both the highest in years.
    Since Italy's general election in May, the country's stock
market has lost 18 percent and bank stocks have plunged 30
percent. Wider contagion has been pretty limited, but at this
stage it cannot be blindly dismissed.
    
    SPILLOVER
    Goldman Sachs has constructed a model that shows that since
2010, on days when there's been an equivalent 100 bps rise in
Italian yields, Spanish yields rise by around 40 bps, while
safe-haven flows push German yields down by around 20 bps.
    In equities, this results in Spanish, French and German
markets falling 3.5 to 5 percent, and U.S., UK and Japanese
stocks falling between 2 and 3 percent. 
    More broadly, Spanish financial conditions tighten by around
40 bps, and U.S., UK and Japanese conditions tighten by around
20 bps. Thanks to the fall in the euro's exchange rate and Bund
yields, German financial conditions ease by around 15 bps.
    
    
    
    
    Spillovers in the 2010-13 period were obviously greater than
the years since, but the analysis shows that meaningful moves in
Italian bonds do move other markets. Some more than others.
    Given how heavily invested Italian banks are in the
country's sovereign bonds, the correlation between BTP futures
and euro zone banking stocks is particularly strong.
    This week, the simple daily correlation between the two
reached 0.76, matching levels seen in May and closing in on the
crisis peaks of 0.85 to 0.90 in 2011 and 2012. The highest
possible correlation between two asset classes or markets is
1.0.
    

    At the root of the current volatility is the budget standoff
between Rome and Brussels. Italian government sources told
Reuters on Wednesday that next year's deficit target remains 2.4
percent of gross domestic product, falling to 2 percent in 2021,
maybe even lower. 
    But growth in Italy has been chronically low for years,
nowhere near strong enough to prevent the country's debt-to-GDP
ratio from rising. Are these forecasts enough to bring the ratio
down to a rate acceptable to Brussels? 
    Punishment from Brussels over the deficit might not keep
Italian politicians up at night, but market forces would. Rising
bond yields would damage growth even more, and the perfect storm
of weak growth and higher debt funding costs could push the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 130 pct even higher. 
    That would bring the rating agencies back into play. Italy
could be downgraded, maybe even by three notches to junk. ""The
wider connotations of falling down this path don't bear thinking
about,"" says Steve Barrow at Standard Bank.

    BENGALURU, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The euro will withstand the
latest political turmoil in Italy and any short-term spill will
be limited, but it may be another six months before the dominant
dollar trade is swept aside, according to a Reuters poll of
currency strategists.
    After its best run since 2003 last year, the single currency
is down close to 4 percent so far in 2018, driven mainly by
increasing bets in favour of the dollar on solid U.S. economic
performance and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening path.
    Markets recently have been unnerved by the uncertainty
surrounding Italy's debt pile, fiscal plans and future ties with
Europe, which pushed the single currency to a six-week low of
$1.1504 against the dollar on Tuesday. [nL8N1WI4KW]
    But the latest poll of over 70 strategists taken Sept 28-Oct
3 forecast the euro <EUR=> to trade higher at $1.16 in three
months from around $1.15 on Wednesday. It was then expected to
rise to $1.22 in a year, about a six percent rise from here.
    ""We feel that a lot of bad news is already priced into
Italian assets - including a Moody's downgrade - and hence see
the balance of risks tilted towards the euro moving higher from
here as some of the markets' worst fears are shelved,"" noted
Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
    The single currency is expected to fall at most by only one
percent to a low of $1.14 at some point over the next three
months, according to the median of 30 strategists who answered
an additional question. But that would still be comfortably
above a 13-month low of $1.1297 hit in August.
    ""For the euro to move well below $1.1500 and back down
towards the previous lows...we would really need to see the
Italian debt situation escalate significantly from here and
challenge the sustainability of the euro zone and euro going
forward,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG.
    ""That is not our base case scenario. But obviously if we
reach that kind of a crisis scenario, all bets are off, because
it will be going a lot lower.""
    
    LESS BACKING FOR GREENBACK IN 2019
    While currency speculators increased their bets in favour of
the dollar for the second week in a row, strategists in the
latest Reuters poll were almost evenly split on whether the
greenback's rally has already stalled. [nL2N1WE1SB]
    A majority of strategists who answered a separate question
said the U.S. dollar's dominance will last only another three
months or six most.
    With several of the factors that have helped the dollar
rally expected to fade soon, most major currencies are forecast
to gain in a year.
    
    
    ""It might run up a little bit further for a couple of months
on the emerging markets side, but the dollar versus major
currencies is starting to peak,"" said Gavin Friend, senior
markets strategist at NAB.
    ""Markets are getting more interested in the end of the U.S.
(tightening) cycle, which has been almost fully priced in.""
    Against the dollar, sterling was forecast to strengthen by
the time Britain leaves the European Union. But over the coming
year it was not expected to regain its losses since the shock
Brexit vote in 2016. [GBP/POLL]
    ""Our basic assumption is that we think the EU and the UK
will eventually reach a Brexit deal. At this stage, it is still
highly uncertain how they get to that kind of end-point of a
deal. The pound could yet weaken further before a deal is
reached,"" added Hardman.
    ""But we still think that overall, a deal is more likely as
both sides want to avoid a no-deal scenario. That should result
in the pound strengthening notably.""

    * Higher funding costs ahead compound capital erosion
problem
    * Lenders' refinancing needs become more pressing in 2019

    By Valentina Za
    MILAN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A spike in Italy's bond yields has
put the country's banks under renewed pressure, raising the
spectre of capital shortfalls just as challenging refinancing
deadlines near.
    Domestic government bonds account for 10 percent of Italian
banks' total assets, making them vulnerable to a rise in Rome's
debt costs under the anti-austerity government.
    Caught in the bank-sovereign ""doom loop,"" Italian banks
replaced fleeing foreign investors during the euro zone debt
crisis of 2011-2012, buying up Italy's bonds. They similarly
stepped up purchases of domestic debt in May and June during a
market sell-off of Italian assets, before lowering them in
August as prices steadied. [nL8N1VI0NL]
    But as the yield premium Italian bonds pay over safer German
Bunds rose, banks lost on average 40 basis points of their core
capital in the second quarter and another 8 bps in the third,
analysts say. 
    When the new coalition's spending plans first emerged in
mid-May, the Italian-German spread was just 130 bps. It climbed
above 300 bps this week after the government unveiled deficit
goals that increase the borrowing needs of a country that has
the world's third-largest public debt pile.
    An increase to 400 bps would force some lenders to tap
investors for cash, the head of the Italian traders' association
Assiom Forex, Luigi Belluti, warned last week.   
    Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM <BAMI.MI> was among the
worst-hit in the second quarter, losing precious capital it
needs for a bad loan clean-up. Capital erosion also complicates
turnaround efforts at Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>,
bailed out by the state last year.
    
    REGULATORY PRESSURE?
    Italian banks have been restructuring in recent years,
raising capital to fund disposals of bad debt and cutting costs.
But loan losses and negative interest rates hurt earnings and
mean returns do not cover their cost of equity.
    Market stress is meanwhile driving up the cost of funding.
    Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, one of Italy's strongest banks, in
March paid 1.83 percent to issue a 10-year bond <IT178534017=>
that traded on Wednesday at 3.12 percent.
    Intesa is the only lender to have raised unsecured funds
since the May turmoil, selling five-year debt at a hefty 2.15
percent in August. [nL8N1VE4MC]
    Traders say the market has now frozen up again. 
    That is an issue for banks such as Monte dei Paschi and
Carige <CRGI.MI> which need to replenish their second-tier
capital with hybrid debt, and could become a problem across the
sector if the hiatus is prolonged. 
    With 240 billion euros in cheap longer-term funds from the
European Central Bank, of which they have been the biggest
takers, Italian banks have no immediate liquidity concerns.
    They have not suffered deposit flights and could easily
continue to shield their net interest income and get to the end
of the year without selling bonds.
    But market access is crucial.
    ""If the dearth of wholesale issues we're currently observing
were to last for another three to six months it would become a
real problem: regulators want banks to be able to tap markets
whenever they need to,"" said Francesco Castelli, head of fixed
income at Banor Capital.
    Italian banks had an average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
-- one of two key liquidity indicators monitored by supervisors
-- of 171 percent at end-2017, well above the required 100
percent, according to the Bank of Italy.
    The LCR ratio measures assets a bank can promptly sell for
cash and suffers if rising interest rates erode their value.    
    Larger-than-average liquidity buffers may reflect regulatory
pressure, Castelli said, adding supervisors would probably want
banks to keep those reserves intact when they start replacing
ECB funds with regular debt.
    
    SHARING THE PAIN
    Refinancing needs will become more pressing next year.
    Starting from mid-2019 Italian banks will have to exclude
from their net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the second key
liquidity indicator monitored by regulators, 140 billion euros
in longer-term loans that mature in June 2020.
    Even before the latest flare-up in Italian yields, rating
agency Moody's warned that Italian banks would see funding costs
rise as they repaid those ECB funds, pressuring earnings.
    Italian banks must also refinance by 2020 roughly half of
267 billion euros in bonds they had outstanding in February.
    They have traditionally relied on customers to buy debt but
stricter financial rules introduced after the global crisis of
2007-2008 and tax changes in Italy since 2012 now make retail
funding more difficult. 
    In a further funding challenge, banks will have to comply
with new European rules on debt and capital that can be wiped
out to absorb potential losses.
    ""There is a phase-in period from January 2019, but if they
don't start issuing efficiently next year banks might face
difficulties meeting the requirements,"" said Cristiano Tommasi,
a partner at law firm Allen & Overy. 
    UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, which has specific such requirements as
Italy's sole globally systemically important bank, has so far
met only around one third of its 2018 funding plan.
    Lenders have passed onto customers only one-fifth of a 100
basis point increase in yield premiums, but they may soon have
to share more of their pain with borrowers. 
    ""If bond spreads keep rising, sooner or later we'll have to
increase lending costs,"" a senior Italian bank executive said.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - As bond investors stress about
Italy's budget plans, key market gauges of euro break-up risks
are starting to flicker -- but to a far lesser degree than they
did just a few months ago.
    Italy's government appears set for a clash with the European
Union, given its spending plans for 2019 and beyond.
[nL8N1WI14R]
    Italy's 10-year bond yield hit 4 1/2-year highs on Tuesday
<IT10YT=RR>, gaining momentum after a lawmaker said most of
Italy's problems would be solved if it ditched the euro. 
    But in contrast to the brutal May selloff, market gauges
reflecting risks of Italy leaving the euro zone -- a possibility
market players dub ""Quitaly"" or ""Italexit"" -- are flickering
rather than flashing.
        
    1. CDS VS CDS 
    Italian credit default swaps (CDS), derivatives used to
protect against exposure to a default, are considered more
likely to pay out in event of ""Quitaly"", if the contract was
drawn up according to 2014 guidelines instead of earlier 2003
rules.
    Therefore, the difference between how the two types of CDS
trade is one gauge of whether markets are positioning for
redenomination. 
    While the gap between the two contracts has spread, it
remains below the width reached in May, when markets were roiled
by fears of a snap election that could become a de facto
referendum on the euro.
    ""It's clearly not as bad as May. Italy doesn't want to leave
the euro,"" said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at
Futures First Info Services.
    
    
    2. CACS IN THE CRADLE
    How investors trade Italian bonds issued before and after
2013 is also telling. 
    That year, regulators introduced new rules stipulating that
European government bond contracts contain collective action
clauses (CACs). This means that majority bondholder approval is
needed for a restructuring, including a change in the currency
of payment. 
    In late May, bonds issued before 2013 – and therefore
without CAC protection – sold off more sharply than debt issued
after 2013; for example, the yield gap between Italy's March
2022 bond issued in September 2011 and an April 2022 bond was 10
basis points.    
    
   Since then, the two issues have traded in lock-step, although
this week has seen some signs of slight preference for the 2017
issue, suggesting a ""Quitaly"" premium may be creeping back.
    
    3. NEW YORK OR ROME?
    During the May rout, Italy's two dollar-denominated bonds
maturing 2023 and 2033 outperformed their locally-issued, euro
denominated peers, as bonds governed by New York law offer
stronger protection against restructuring, including currency
redenomination.
    However, yields on both types of bonds have risen since
Italy delivered its budget deficit proposal last week.
    
    There are perhaps two explanations for this. 
    First, while the budget deficit forecast was higher than
expected, it did not breach the 3 percent limit mandated by the
EU, which would have raised questions about Italy's commitment
to the euro. 
    Second, overall rhetoric from top officials reaffirms
Italy's commitment to the euro [nR1N1RB01S].
    ""We think the key worry for markets right now is not an
‘Italexit’, but the impact from a wider fiscal deficit on
Italy's debt sustainability, especially given the backdrop of a
fast-approaching end to ECB QE,"" said TS Lombard senior
economist Shweta Singh.
    
    4. INFLATION STATION
    Italy issues inflation-linked bonds, some pegged to euro
zone inflation and others to Italian prices. 
    Demand for bonds pegged to euro zone consumer prices should
have more demand than those linked to domestic prices because
Italy's economic growth and inflation lag the bloc. 
    But that doesn't hold if a possible redenomination comes
into play, because a new Italian currency would probably fall,
fuelling inflation.
    So buying Italian inflation is a clean hedge for
redenomination risk. In May, yields and break-even levels on
Italy's May 2023 bond pegged to euro zone inflation and May 2023
bond pegged to Italian inflation were almost identical.
<IT525367=> <IT532934=> 
    In September, when hopes were for a market-friendly budget, 
the spread between the real yield of the two bonds widened to
nearly 30 basis points. It has now narrowed back to just 6 bps.
    
    5. LOVING THE SCHATZ
    German two-year government bonds -- the Schatz -- are a
favourite with investors nervous about a euro zone break-up.
    Bonds from top-rated Germany, the euro zone's biggest
economy, are viewed as some of the safest assets in the world.  
    Short-dated bonds also tend to benefit from near-term risks
and are seen by some as a proxy for the how the deutsche mark
would trade should it return. 
    The Schatz yield hit a one-month low at almost minus 0.60
percent <DE2YT=RR> on Tuesday as Italian bonds sold off.     
    In May, two-year yields tumbled far more, hitting one-year
lows, slid to record lows ahead of French elections last year
and dived after Britain's Brexit vote in 2016.
    ""This does seem to be seen as an Italian-specific issue
rather than a systemic issue for Europe,"" said David Zahn, head
of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Britain issued statements
overnight accusing Russian military intelligence of directing a
host of cyber attacks aimed at undermining Western democracies
by sowing confusion in everything from sport to transport and
the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has yet to respond
but has in the past repeatedly denied such accusations. The
Dutch Ministry of Defense and UK officials are scheduled to hold
a news conference in the Hague this morning that's also expected
to be about Russian intelligence activities. In the wake of the
Skripal poisoning, Britain has been active in trying to persuade
other European capitals to back further sanctions on Moscow.
    Irish PM Leo Varadkar heads to Brussels as the decisive
period for Brexit negotiations begins. The core of the
discussion today will be about the European Union stance in
resolving the disagreement with the UK on managing the Irish
border after Brexit: the aim is still to get much of the deal
worked out by the EU summit later this month. The FT reports
that Dublin would back any push by Theresa May to keep all the
UK in a temporary customs union with the EU until a permanent
arrangement was worked out - something Brussels has until now
balked at.

today on the 60th anniversary of the French constitution, which
de Gaulle introduced in 1958 with sweeping powers for the office
of president. Macron will no doubt pay homage to his predecessor
and to the stabilising effects which the constitution had on
France, at the time seriously buffeted by the aftermath of the
Algerian conflict. The added piquancy of the event is that
Macron is still aiming to revamp the charter to cut the number
of lawmakers by a third and introduce an unaccustomed dose of
proportional representation. 
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
Growing evidence the U.S. economy is picking up steam just as
the rest of the world cools has catapulted 10-year U.S. Treasury
yields to their highest in seven years and the dollar to its
strongest in six weeks, unnerving global markets fearful of the
rising cost of dollar funding around the world. Outsize gains in
U.S. September business confidence and private-sector payrolls
saw markets rush on Wednesday to fully price in the four more
U.S. interest rate rises that the Federal Reserve has been
signalling, and which Fed chief Jerome Powell reinforced this
week by describing the U.S. economy as ""remarkably positive"".
Ten-year Treasury yields climbed more than 10 basis points on
Wednesday to their highest since 2011, the biggest one-day gain
since just after the U.S. election in November 2016. They 
extended that climb overnight to as high as 3.23 percent and 
the 2-10-year U.S. yield curve steepened above 30 basis points
for the first time since July. The dollar’s rise was broad-
based, with dollar/yen rising to the year’s highs and
euro/dollar falling below $1.15 for the first time since
mid-August. 
    With Brent crude oil prices rising above $86 per barrel,
many emerging markets heavily dependent on dollar borrowing and
energy imports are feeling the heat. Hong Kong, Seoul and
Jakarta benchmark indices all fell more than 1 percent overnight
with Japan’s Nikkei in the red too. India’s rupee hit another
record low and Indonesia’s rupiah fell to its weakest in 20
years. MSCI’s emerging-market equity index suffered its biggest
fall in four months. 
    Buoyed by both the upbeat economic news and the approach of
a third-quarter U.S. earnings season next week that’s likely to
clock annul profit growth in excess of 20 percent, the S&P500
came within a sliver of record highs late Wednesday – even
though the bond market disturbance has seen futures drop 0.5
percent today. European stock futures are marked down by a
similar amount as European government bond yields rose in tandem
with Treasuries.

506,1130,8b421b0b84c8ccb001068ff775dff09a,Need for lengthy ECB guidance will diminish as inflation rises: Rehn,2018-10-04 16:00:01,EUR,1.43986,2018-10-04 16:00:36,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    HELSINKI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The need for the European
Central Bank to give financial markets an extended guidance on
future interest rate moves will diminish once inflation bounces
back enough, ECB policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday.
    The comments suggest that the debate about the ECB's
guidance remains open after board members Benoit Coeure and
Peter Praet both argued recently that the bank may need to
provide an even longer view on the expected path of interest
rates beyond an initial hike. [nL8N1W66BW]
    The ECB now guides markets for steady rates ""through"" the
summer of 2019, suggesting a move sometime in the final quarter
of the year.
    ""The need for extended forward guidance on monetary policy
will also diminish, once inflation has reached sufficient
progress towards the price stability objective,"" Rehn, also the
Governor of Finland's central bank, said in a statement.
    ""As it stands, financial market expectations concerning the
timing of the first interest rate rise are consistent with the
Governing Council's statements,"" Rehn added.
    The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent and does
not expect to hit this level before the end of the decade as the
currency bloc is still struggling to absorb economic slack.
    Steering market expectations has been a key challenge for
central banks across the world since the start of the financial
crisis in 2008 as policymakers battled a lending freeze and
fears of an unprecedented depression.
    The ECB expects rates to rise only very slowly and a
longer-term guidance could stop investors from pricing in more
aggressive moves and keep borrowing conditions low for longer.
    After years of aggressive stimulus, the ECB has been
preparing investors for the end of its 2.6 trillion-euro ($3.00
trillion) bond-buying programme in December and for the first
interest rate increase since 2011 sometime after the summer of
next year.

    BERLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A significant slowdown in private
investment is a weak spot for the German economy, the BdB
banking association said on Thursday, slightly lowering it 2019
growth forecast for Europe's largest economy on trade frictions
and weak emerging markets.
    The association said it expected the economy to grow by 1.8
percent, down from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent. The BdB
expects a growth rate of 1.9 percent this year.
    ""Given the escalating trade conflict and the difficulties
facing some emerging countries, the world economy faces the
threat of sliding toward dangerous territory,"" BdB Managing
Director Christian Ossig said in a statement.
    ""We assume that the risks will remain manageable,"" he said,
adding that the German economy should remain stable despite
growth rates lower than last year's 2.2 percent.
    The German economy has been relying on private consumption
and government spending for growth as exports weaken. The
services sector has been providing a cushion against slowing
manufacturing output. 
    The German government last month also lowered its growth
forecast for this year to around 2.0 percent, saying companies
were not investing enough to achieve higher growth rates because
they lacked skilled workers to increase their output.
    ""Judging by the profits of companies, high capacity
utilisation, persistent economic growth and very low interest
rates, investments should have increased much more strongly,""
Ossig said.
    The BdB has also lowered its forecasts for private
investments in machinery and construction for both 2018 and
2019. It expects investments in machinery to grow by 3.1 percent
next year, down from a previous forecast of 3.6.
    It said the European Central Bank needed to put an end to
its negative interest rate policy.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A decade since Lehman Brothers
bank collapsed, the world's top lenders largely meet tougher
capital requirements aimed at averting a repeat of the ensuing
markets meltdown, regulators said on Thursday.
    The Basel Committee of regulators said that as of December
2017, the world's 111 biggest cross-border or ""Group 1"" banks
would have had a collective capital shortfall of just 25.8
billion euros ($29.8 billion), had all Basel's rules been in
force, a fraction of their earnings.
    The overall core equity capital ratio, which measures
capital to risk-weighted assets, would have risen to 12.9
percent from 12.5 percent in June 2017, roughly triple
pre-crisis levels.
    Basel has published regular updates on compliance with its
tougher capital rules introduced in the aftermath of the crisis,
but the latest assumes that a final batch of requirements agreed
only last December are also in force.
    The minimum versions of these additional rules won't become 
mandatory until January 2022, but Thursday's figures show banks
are largely compliant years ahead of the deadline as markets
pile pressure on lenders to demonstrate their financial
resilience.
    Banks had lobbied hard to water down the additions, warning
that hefty increases in capital requirements would make it
harder for them to lend to businesses.
    But Basel said on Thursday there was no significant increase
in minimum capital requirements due to the final rules added
last December. The capital shortfall does not reflect any
additional capital requirements that national regulators impose.
    
    
    
    OP RISK ROCKETS
    Most of a bank's core capital buffer covers the risk of
loans defaulting, but such ""credit"" risk has fallen
significantly and now represents 65.2 percent of buffers, Basel
said.
    The amount of capital set aside to cover operational risks
such as fines for misconduct, fraud, cyber attacks, poor
internal controls and unauthorised trading, has risen sharply.
It has increased from 7.8 percent at the end of June 2011 to
16.4 percent currently, Basel said.
    Since the financial crisis, banks have been fined billions
of dollars for trying to rig interest rate benchmarks such as
Libor, and currency markets.
    Apart from capital, major banks must also issue a special 
debt known as TLAC that can be converted to capital if a crisis
burns through their core capital buffer. This aims to avoid a
repeat of taxpayers having to bail out lenders.
    When the minimum requirements for TLAC due in 2022 are
applied, eight of the world's 30 top banks have a combined
shortfall of 82 billion euros, down from 109 billion at the end
of June 2017, Basel said.

point of view,"" Rehn said at a conference. ""Monetary policy will
be done based on that, not looking at just one member state but

    He added that the recent sell-off has not had any
significant impact on other members of the currency bloc,
playing down fears that Italy's troubles could spread to others,
like Portugal, Spain or Greece.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Danish bank said
it faces a U.S. criminal probe over suspicious payments in
Estonia. That raises the risk that it could be blacklisted in
America, which sank Latvian peer ABLV, or be fined. Even a
plausible $5 bln hit would send Danske’s capital ratio below its
minimum level.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Danske Bank announced on Oct. 4 that it is in talks with
the U.S. Department of Justice in relation to a criminal
investigation into the bank’s Estonia branch which processed 200
billion euros of potentially suspicious payments between 2007
and 2015.
    - “We are cooperating with the authorities investigating us
as a result of the case. However, it is too early to speculate
on any outcome of the investigations,” interim CEO Jesper
Nielsen said in a statement. 
    - Separately, Denmark’s largest bank by assets disclosed
that it would end its 10 billion crown ($1.5 billion) share
buyback programme after the country’s Financial Supervisory
Authority said it must increase its common equity Tier 1 capital
by the same amount “in order to ensure an adequate capital
coverage of increased compliance and reputational risks”.
    - As a result, Danske Bank said its targeted CET1 capital
ratio would increase to 16 percent from a previous target of
between 14 and 15 percent. The lender’s CET1 ratio was 15.9
percent at the end of June.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A decade since Lehman Brothers
bank collapsed, the world's top lenders largely meet tougher
capital requirements aimed at averting a repeat of the ensuing
markets meltdown, regulators said on Thursday.
    The Basel Committee of regulators said that, as of December
2017, the world's 111 biggest cross-border, or ""Group 1"", banks
would have had a collective capital shortfall of only 25.8
billion euros ($29.8 billion) had all Basel's rules been in
force, a fraction of their earnings.
    The overall core equity capital ratio, which measures
capital to risk-weighted assets, would have risen to 12.9
percent from 12.5 percent in June 2017, roughly triple
pre-crisis levels.
    Basel has published regular updates on compliance with the
tougher capital rules introduced in the aftermath of the crisis,
but the latest assumes that a final batch of requirements agreed
only last December are also in force.
    The minimum versions of these additional rules won't become 
mandatory until January 2022, but Thursday's figures show banks
are largely compliant years ahead of the deadline as markets
pile pressure on lenders to demonstrate their financial
resilience.
    Banks had lobbied hard to water down the additions, warning
that hefty increases in capital requirements would make it
harder for them to lend to businesses.
    But Basel said on Thursday there was no significant increase
in minimum capital requirements as a result of the final rules
added last December. The capital shortfall does not reflect any
additional capital requirements that national regulators impose.
    Separately, the European Banking Authority said that banks
in the European Union would need a collective 24.5 billion euros
of capital to meet the full Basel requirements, of which 6
billion euros would be for core buffers.
    
    
    
    OPERATIONAL RISK ROCKETS
    Most of a bank's core capital buffer covers the risk of
loans defaulting, but such ""credit"" risk has fallen
significantly and now represents 65.2 percent of buffers, Basel
said.
    The amount of capital set aside to cover operational risks
-- such as fines for misconduct, fraud, cyber attacks, poor
internal controls and unauthorised trading -- has risen sharply.
It has increased from 7.8 percent at the end of June 2011 to
16.4 percent currently, Basel said.
    Since the financial crisis, banks have been fined billions
of dollars for trying to rig interest rate benchmarks such as
Libor and currency markets.
    Apart from capital, major banks must also issue a special 
debt known as TLAC that can be converted to capital if a crisis
burns through their core capital buffer. This aims to avoid a
repeat of taxpayers having to bail out lenders.
    When the minimum requirements for TLAC due in 2022 are
applied, eight of the world's 30 top banks have a combined
shortfall of 82 billion euros, down from 109 billion at the end
of June 2017, Basel said.

[nL8N1WB2TD]

 (Adds details)
    DUBLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ireland's central bank has seen a
surge in financial services firms seeking to set up or extend
their operations in Ireland as a result of Brexit and is
processing over 100 applications, its governor Philip Lane said
on Thursday.
    Ireland last year said it had received over 100 enquiries
from London-based companies examining moves, but the central
bank's update suggested firms are triggering plans on how to
serve their customers once Britain leaves the European Union.
    ""The potential activities range from banks, investment
firms, trading venues, electronic money institutions, commercial
insurance and retail insurance,"" Lane told a parliamentary
committee.
    Although Lane reiterated that Brexit will be negative for
Ireland's economy and financial system, the growth of its
international financial centre as a result of neighbouring
Britain leaving the bloc is seen as one of the opportunities.
    Barclays, Legal & General Investment Management and Standard
Life Aberdeen are among the companies who have chosen Dublin as
a post-Brexit base against stiff competition from rival centres
including Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris.
    The Irish Central Bank's Director of Asset Management
Supervision Michael Hodson said last week that the bank had seen
a sizeable number of fund management companies seeking to
relocate to Ireland.
    He also warned that firms who had not yet lodged their
applications would face a challenge to get authorised by March
2019, when Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The European Union's top court
should back the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme
against a group of German complainants seeking to block it on
legal grounds, the court's adviser on the case said on Thursday.
    The programme is set to end at the end of the year in any
case, but the court's ruling will set a key precedent for future
ECB policy decisions.
    Advocate general Melchior Wathelet rejected complainant
arguments that the ECB's 2 trillion-euro ($2.30 trillion)
purchases of government bonds had bankrolled indebted
governments and distorted financial markets.
    The purchases, a cornerstone of the ECB's efforts that have
revived inflation and growth in the euro zone, has often been
criticised in Germany for inflating bond prices and endangering
taxpayer money.
    ""The programme does not infringe the prohibition of monetary
financing and does not exceed the powers of the ECB,"" Wathelet
said in his opinion to the court.
    The advocate's opinions are not binding, but the court
generally follows them.  
    Wathelet emphasised, among other factors, that the risks
associated with the purchases were only partly shared across
countries and that the ECB retained the power to stop them at
any time, meaning they did not represent a guaranteed source of
funding for governments.    
    The European Court of Justice had been asked by Germany's
constitutional court to provide a preliminary ruling on whether
the ECB's bond purchases broke EU law.
    Once that ruling is out, the case will go back to the German
court in Karlsruhe, where the group of conservative German
academics and politicians brought the original case.

reduce the amount of interest payments and accounting losses
that banks can deduct from their taxable income as part of
measures to fund next year's budget, a government source said.
    The source said it was possible that such a move, which was
first reported by Il Sole 24 Ore daily, could be included in the
budget law for 2019.
    Banks would only be able to deduct 85 percent of interest
payments from their tax base and would have to spread writedown
losses stemming from the newly introduced IFRS9 accounting rule
over a period of two to 10 years, the paper said.
    The source also confirmed that the government was

executive to spur companies' capital levels, known as 'Allowance

    BELGRADE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
on Thursday raised Serbia's 2018 growth forecast to 4.2 percent
from the 3.5 percent it had forecast previously, citing the
country's ""dramatic"" economic improvement. 
    Serbia, the largest of the six ex-Yugoslav republics, has
seen its economy start to recover in the past three years after
years of decline due to wars and isolation in the 1990s,
followed by the 2008 global financial crisis.   
    ""Strong macroeconomic performance continues. Growth
accelerated in 2018 supported by private consumption and strong
investment and exports,"" James Roaf, the head of the Fund's
mission told a news conference after a two-week visit to
Belgrade. 
    The IMF expects Serbia's economy to grow 3.5 percent in
2019.   
    The Washington-based lender also reviewed a 30-month
non-financial, advisory and monitoring arrangement (PCI) agreed
with Serbia in June, which is tailored for countries that do not
need financial support. Serbia needs the arrangement to bolster
investor confidence. 
    Roaf said the mission and the Serbian government had also
agreed a 2019 fiscal deficit target of 0.5 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP). According to Finance Ministry data,
Serbia currently maintains a 0.6 percent budget surplus.
    The public debt of the European Union applicant country is
expected to shrink to around 55 percent of GDP by the end of
2018, from around 70 percent at the beginning of 2015 when
Belgrade and the IMF agreed a 1.2 billion euro loan deal. 
    The arrangement expired in February without Serbia drawing
funds from it.
    ""In the last few years, Serbia had a huge, dramatic
improvement ... and experienced an increase of growth,"" Roaf
said. 
    Due to the improvement in the economy, the government will
from November abolish pension cuts introduced in 2014 and raise
payments by between 8 percent and 13.2 percent.
    Serbia's headline inflation increased to 2.6 percent in
August but is expected to stay inside the central bank's target
of 3 percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points, in 2018 and
2019.
    Serbia's Finance Minister Sinisa Mali said the government
plans to ease some of the tax burden on labour, make phased
increases in public sector wages and use 208 billion dinars
(1.76 billion euros) for capital investments in 2019. 
    Roaf warned Serbia must complete its structural reforms,
dispose of remaining state-run firms and improve its resiliency
to global risks.

    ATHENS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Greece has been working on an
asset protection scheme to help its banks offload sour loans
from their balance sheets and shown it to European Union
competition authorities and banking supervisors, bankers close
to the matter said on Thursday.
    The scheme would involve setting up special purpose vehicles
(SPVs) where billions of euros of bad loans would be transferred
from bank balance sheets to help speed up the clean-up process.
    ""There is such a plan that has been prepared by the HFSF
bank rescue fund some time ago,"" one senior banker told Reuters
on Thursday, declining to be named.
    ""The plan has been shown to the government, European
authorities and SSM banking supervision,"" the banker said.
    The key question remains whether such a plan could get the
green light from the EU's DG Competition or hit a brick wall as
a form of state aid.
    The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), the bank
rescue fund that owns stakes in Greek banks after taking part in
three recapitalisations, would not confirm whether such a scheme
was ready to go into operation if it gets EU clearance.
    ""All this talk about an asset protection scheme is ideas,
thoughts that the fund exchanges with stakeholders. There is no
final, concrete plan,"" an HFSF official told Reuters.
    A senior government official said that Athens was ""not
looking into such solutions soon"", adding that bank fundamentals
did not justify Wednesday's selloff which saw bank shares tumble
8 percent, led by a hefty drop in shares of Piraeus Bank
<BOPr.AT>.
    The Greek bank association has not seen details of the
scheme, which media reports suggested could involve state
guarantees on bonds issued by the SPVs and sold to distressed
debt funds.
    ""I am not aware of any discussion going on these days
between the Greek government and (EU) institutions on solutions
that would involve state guarantees,"" said a European Union
official.
    Should such a plan for sour loan disposals get EU clearance
it would help banks shrink their mountain of so-called
non-performing exposures (NPEs), or bad loans, faster.
    Bad loans are the biggest challenge facing the Greek banking
sector. At the end of June they had fallen by 4.1 percent from
the first quarter to 88.6 billion euros ($102 billion) or 47.6
percent of banks' overall loan book.
    Banks have been under regulatory pressure to tackle the bad
debt problem, which restricts their ability to expand credit and
help the economy's recovery.
    Greek lenders had bad loans totalling 14.5 billion euros or
5.5 percent of all their loans, when the global financial crisis
began in 2008.
    Bad loans then soared to 106.9 billion euros or 50.5 percent
of all loans by the end of June 2016.
    Banks have agreed with ECB regulators to take steps to
shrink them to 64.6 billion euro by the end of 2019, meaning the
NPE ratio would fall to 35.2 percent of all loans on their
books.

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Italy is considering reducing tax
benefits for the country's lenders as part of measures to fund
next year's budget, a government source said on Thursday.
    Confirming a report in Il Sole 24 Ore daily, the source said
the government could reduce the amount of interest payments and
writedowns that banks can deduct from their taxable income.
    Italy's anti-establishment government is struggling to
finance a number of expensive electoral promises which it wants
to include in next year's budget.
    If the changes went through, banks would only be able to
deduct 85 percent of interest payments from their tax base and
would have to spread losses stemming from the newly introduced
IFRS9 accounting rule over a period of two to 10 years, Il Sole
reported.
    Giovanni Razzoli, an analyst at broker Equita SIM, said he
expected a muted impact on banks' earnings from the outlined
measures, adding this was already priced in by the market, where
Italian banks trade at a deep discount to the value of their
assets.
    Razzoli estimated a 4 percent hit to earnings and an average
capital erosion of 6 basis points.
    The head of Italian banking association ABI said increasing
the tax pressure on banks risked weakening the economy as
lenders could become less able to support businesses.
    But Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the
populist 5-Star Movement, said it was ""sacrosanct ... to strip
bankers of some of their privileges.""
    ""If a good economic performance hinged on bankers'
privileges, we would be in the Land of Plenty by now given all
the money the sector got from previous governments. Things are
going to change,"" he said in a Facebook post.
    Italy's previous centre-left government passed several
measures to help the banking sector recover after a deep
recession, culminating in the state bailout of the country's
third-largest bank Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> in 2017.
    The 5-Star Movement rode popular anger at a string of bank
failures in recent years that have left thousands of Italian who
held their local lenders' bonds and stocks out of pocket.
    Italian banks are large holders of the country's debt and
have been badly hit by market turmoil over Italian bonds.
[nL8N1WH52F]
    The source also confirmed that the government was
considering scrapping tax incentives introduced by the previous
executive to spur companies' capital levels, known as 'Allowance
for Corporate Equity' or ACE.

potentially decisive talks in the Brexit saga. Foster is due to
meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier and diplomats from other EU

trade unions organise demonstrations today against his reforms.
    The eurozone was not spared as the IMF cuts its growth
forecasts for this year and next across the board due to growing
protectionism and troubles in emerging markets. The region saw
its 2018 growth forecast cut to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent
previously, with Germany particularly hard hit by a drop in
manufacturing orders and trade volumes. The new forecasts,
released on the Indonesian resort island of Bali where the IMF
and World Bank annual meetings are getting underway, show that a
burst of strong growth, fueled partly by U.S. tax cuts and
rising demand for imports, was starting to wane: it now predicts
3.7 percent global growth this year and next, down from its July
forecast of 3.9 percent growth for both years.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
    World markets remain on edge after a nervy start to the week
in holiday-sapped trading on Monday. The International Monetary
Fund chimed with the tension by downgrading its global economic
growth forecasts for this year and next to 3.7 percent from 3.9
percent, talking of ‘plateauing’ of the world economy and
raising red flags about rising trade barriers, tightening dollar
funding and stress in emerging markets. Wall St stock indices
closed little changed on Monday night, with government and
Treasury markets shut for the Columbus Day holiday. But with
markets increasingly convinced the incoming U.S. economic news
warrants four more Federal Reserve interest rate rises between
now and the end of next year, 10-year Treasury yields resumed
their steep climb to new 7-year highs on Tuesday, hitting 3.2520
percent earlier and pushing the 2-10 year yield curve to its
steepest since June - at almost 37 basis points. The dollar
strengthened across the board overnight as a result, with only
Japan’s yen outperforming among the major currencies as stock
market tensions rose in Asia. 
    Returning from Monday’s holiday, Japan’s Nikkei lost more
than 1 percent but Chinese benchmarks stabilised after their
worst one-day fall on Monday in more than two years amid worries
about trade and tech sector friction with the United States.
China’s yuan recovered some ground from Monday’s 7-week lows,
hit after the latest weekend easing of bank reserve requirements
by the People’s Bank of China. The offshore yuan was a touch
weaker early in London trade, but off its worst levels from
Monday at 6.9371 per dollar. The dollar was generally higher
against other Asia currencies such as India’s rupee, Indonesia’s
rupiah and Malaysia’s ringgit. MSCI's benchmark emerging market
equity index was in the red for the fourth straight session.
Pakistan’s rupee tumbled some 8 percent in an effective
devaluation by the central bank and as the finance minister said
the government would seek to open talks with the IMF this week
on emergency financial assistance – despite recent efforts by
the government of PM Khan to avoid a second bailout programme in
five years. 
    U.S. stock futures were slightly lower and European
equivalents higher after the latter suffered heavy losses on
Monday amid fresh worries about the standoff between Rome and
Brussels over Italy’s planned budget loosening. Ten-year Italian
government yields briefly touched a new 4-1/2 year high of 3.628
percent first thing before retreating amid reports the
government was set to launch an investor roadshow to support the
bond market. Italy’s deputy PM Salvini, meantime, said the
government would not change its budget plans. South Africa's
rand lifted off lows as a Treasury spokesman said embattled
finance minister Nene will travel to Indonesia for this week’s
IMF meeting despite reports on Monday he was set to resign.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The euro languished near a
seven-week low on Tuesday as concerns about a row in the
European Union over Italy's budget persisted.
    The euro has tended not to budge in response to spikes in
Italian bond yields triggered by developments in the dispute,
with investors judging that Rome's spending plans will not
impact the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
    But the threat of a showdown along with weakness in stock
markets worldwide has seen traders who had bet on a fourth
quarter euro rebound ditch the single currency. 
    The euro <EUR=EBS> fell 0.2 percent to $1.1465, close to a
seven-week low of $1.146 reached during the previous session. 
    Italian government bond yields meanwhile edged down from 
4-1/2-year highs on hopes that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
will strike a moderate tone when defending the government's
budget in parliament. 
    ""In light of current levels of stress in the Italian
markets, the question now is how far the Bund/BTP yield gaps can
blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,""
said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister on Monday denounced European
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Economics
Commissioner Pierre Moscovici as enemies of Europe.  
    Derrick said increasingly it was the dollar rather than the
Swiss franc that was benefiting from safe-haven trades in
response to the concerns over Italy.  
    Against the Swiss franc <EURCHF=EBS>, the euro gained 0.1
percent to 1.1414 <EURCHF=EBS>.  
    Ten-year Treasury yields resumed their steep climb to
seven-year highs on Tuesday. That helped the dollar strengthen
across the board with only Japan's yen outperforming among the
major currencies.
    Against a basket of its rivals <.DXY>, the greenback rose
0.2 percent to 95.933, not far off a seven-week top of 96.127
hit last week.
    The Chinese offshore yuan <CNY=D4> was slightly stronger on
the day at 6.9160 yuan per dollar. It recovered somewhat after
slipping about 0.35 percent overnight.
    At the weekend, China's central bank moved to inject more
liquidity into the financial system as policymakers worried
about the economic impact of a heated trade row with the United
States. [nL4N1WO023]
    ""U.S. yields are rising, whereas the Chinese authorities are
trying to push down the Chinese yield. That's typically a
stronger dollar/weaker renminbi situation,"" Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, said.
    ""If the stimulus measures... by the Chinese authorities are
regarded as positive for the Chinese economy, then it will
support the renminbi,"" he said. ""But at the moment, that's not
the case.""

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a seven-week low
on Tuesday as the dollar rose broadly and concerns persisted
about a row in the European Union over Italy's budget.
    The euro has tended not to budge in response to spikes in
Italian bond yields triggered by developments in the dispute,
with investors judging that Rome's spending plans will not
impact the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
    But the threat of a showdown along with weakness in stock
markets worldwide has seen traders who had bet on a fourth
quarter euro rebound ditch the single currency. 
    The euro <EUR=EBS> fell 0.4 percent to $1.1444, its lowest
since Aug. 20. 
    ""Concerns over Italy have largely remained contained,
dampening downside risks for the euro in the near-term, but it
may not remain that way if Italian risks continue to escalate,""
said analysts at MUFG. 
    The dollar strengthened across the board helped by U.S.
Treasury yields resuming their steep climb to seven-year highs.
Only Japan's yen outperformed the dollar among the major
currencies.
    Against a basket of its rivals <.DXY>, the greenback rose
0.3 percent to 96.081, not far off a seven-week top of 96.127
hit last week.
    Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria struck a resolute
tone on his controversial budget plans in Rome's parliament and
that saw Italy's benchmark 10-year government bond yield move
towards a 4-1/2-year high. [GVD/EUR]
    ""In light of current levels of stress in the Italian
markets, the question now is how far the Bund/BTP yield gaps can
blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,""
said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister on Monday denounced European
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Economics
Commissioner Pierre Moscovici as enemies of Europe.  
    Derrick said increasingly it was the dollar rather than the
Swiss franc that was benefiting from safe-haven trades in
response to the concerns over Italy.  
    Against the Swiss franc <EURCHF=EBS>, the euro gained 0.2
percent to 1.1376 <EURCHF=EBS>.  
    The Chinese offshore yuan <CNY=D4> was slightly weaker on
the day at 6.9350 yuan per dollar. It recovered somewhat after
slipping about 0.35 percent overnight.
    At the weekend, China's central bank moved to inject more
liquidity into the financial system as policymakers worried
about the economic impact of a heated trade row with the United
States. [nL4N1WO023]
    ""U.S. yields are rising, whereas the Chinese authorities are
trying to push down the Chinese yield. That's typically a
stronger dollar/weaker renminbi situation,"" Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, said.

676,1538,1104482cfc5c118168918d67bd84dbd7,"Portugal expects 2.2 pct growth, budget near balance in 2019-MP",2018-10-09 19:04:51,EUR,0,2018-10-09 19:04:57,{'EUR': 'Negative'},"    LISBON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Portugal's government expects the
economy to grow 2.2 percent in 2019 and the budget deficit to
all but disappear, a lawmaker said on Tuesday after meeting the
finance minister about next year's budget plans.
    Andre Silva of the small PAN party, who was the first to
meet with minister Mario Centeno in a round of consultations in
parliament, told reporters the government was aiming to slash
the budget deficit to 0-0.2 percent next year after this year's
projected 0.7 percent. 
    ""Growth is expected to be around 2.2 percent, unemployment
at 6 percent, and public debt cut to 117 percent of GDP,"" Silva
said. That would put growth in line with this year's estimated
expansion.
    ""The minister did not give a precise deficit figure, but it
is expected to be between zero and 0.2 percent, that big a cut,""
he added.
    Portugal expects to finish this year with a debt-to-GDP
ratio of 121.2 percent as it continues to retreat from record
highs of more than 130 percent two years ago.
    The government has to present the draft budget to parliament
by Oct. 15. Meeting this year's 0.7 percent target would mean a
record low deficit in over four decades of the country's
democratic history. And it would come just four years after
Portugal exited an international bailout.
    Although the growth forecast is a tad lower than 2.3 percent
expected previously, it is well above the International Monetary
Fund's latest projection of 1.8 percent, released earlier on
Tuesday as part of its global economic growth forecasts.
    Last year the economy grew 2.7 percent - its strongest pace
since 2000.
    Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week the 2019 draft
budget would target a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP, confirming
an earlier plan released in April which was criticised by his
leftist allies, who want more spending on healthcare and civil
servant wages rather than focusing on deficit cuts.
    Since coming to power in late 2015, Costa's government has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with measures to support
growth, while reversing most of the austerity policies imposed
by a centre-right administration during the 2010-14 debt crisis.

 (Adds details)
    By Michelle Martin
    BERLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - German firms would face extra
tariffs of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) a year if
Britain quits the European Union without a trade deal, and their
exports to Britain might drop by up to 57 percent, Germany's IW
institute said on Tuesday.
    Talks on ending four decades of Britain's membership in the
European Union have entered their final stage more than two
years after Britons voted for Brexit. A hard Brexit would mean
Britain leaving the bloc with no trade deal.
    The BDI industry association - one of Germany's most
influential lobby groups - said a breakthrough in Brexit
negotiations was needed at an Oct. 17-18 summit in Brussels.
    ""Otherwise there is the risk that Europe slides into a
disorderly Brexit and that would cause a huge crisis,"" Managing
Director Joachim Lang told a news conference in Berlin.
    A hard Brexit would cause huge difficulties for tens of
thousands of companies in Europe and hundreds of thousands of
employees in Britain and the European Union, Lang said.
    He noted that many companies were preparing for a hard
Brexit and some wanted to suspend production in Britain from
April as delivery routes could not be secured and some were
moving their headquarters from Britain, adjusting their legal
frameworks and looking for new transport routes.
    Lang said there was no overall figure for how much companies
had spent on preparing for Brexit but some individual
pharmaceutical and chemical companies had spent up to 100
million pounds ($130 million) preparing for Brexit.
    
    AUTO SECTOR TO SUFFER
    A hard Brexit would affect the auto sector - which employs
some 800,000 people in Germany and is the country's biggest
exporter - particularly hard as it would be hit with about 60
percent of the extra costs German companies would face, IW said.
    About 5 percent of Germany's gross domestic product depended
either directly or indirectly on trade with Britain, IW said,
making it the third biggest trading partner for German firms.
    ""That could dramatically change in the foreseeable future,""
the IW study said.
    Referring to a potential plunge in German exports to Britain
if a hard Brexit happens, IW researcher Markos Jung said: ""This
horrific scenario should force politicians to act
constructively."" 
    In the long term, a hard Brexit would probably result in
price rises and a shift in Germany's flow of goods, the IW said.
    Lang said a transition period, which would only be possible
with a Brexit deal, was indispensable to enable German companies
to adapt to the changes to the legal framework that would come
afterwards.
    ""A strong agreement with the EU is far more important for
both sides, especially for Britain, than the remote prospect of
deals with third countries,"" he said.

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italy will do whatever is necessary
to restore calm if market turbulence turns into a financial
crisis, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Tuesday, calling
for more measured debate over government budget plans.
    The coalition last week set a deficit target of 2.4 percent
of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous goal for the
heavily indebted nation, unnerving investors and prompting sharp
criticism from the European Commission.
    Addressing a parliamentary commission, Tria said fears over
next year's budget plan were unjustified. However, he said the
government would act if the spread between its benchmark 10-year
bond yield and the equivalent German bund balloons.
    ""In the face of a financial crisis, the government will do
what it must do, as (ECB president Mario) Draghi did,"" Tria
added, referring to a promise the central bank chief had made in
2012 to do whatever it took to save the euro currency. 
    His words failed to reassure the market, with 10-year yields
hitting a 4-1/2 year high <IT10YT=RR>, pushing the premium
investors demand for holding the bonds over top-rated Germany
paper to around 312 basis points, its widest in five years.
[nL8N1WP2A1]
    The European Commission warned last week that Italy's
deficit plans represented ""a significant deviation from the
fiscal path recommended by the Council"". [nL8N1WM0IR]
    The leaders of the two ruling parties, Luigi Di Maio and
Matteo Salvini, denounced the Commission position and said they
would not backtrack on their spending plans, including tax cuts
and a significant boost in welfare. [nR1N1VZ00V]
    Tria, who is a university professor and is not affiliated to
either coalition party, said the strategy adopted by previous
governments to contain debt had not been efficient, adding that
Italy needed to do more to boost growth and employment. 
    However, he said he wanted to lower the tone with Brussels.
    ""There will now be a constructive discussion with Europe to
show the well-founded reasons for this government's growth
strategy,"" he said.
    Underscoring the anxiety in Europe, European Commission Vice
President Jyrki Katainen told reporters on Tuesday that Italy
was highly vulnerable.
    ""We are concerned that Italy will present totally
unrealistic fiscal targets or growth projections, and that
negotiations will prove very difficult,"" he said in Helsinki.
    The government says its expansive budget will boost growth
and it has targeted output of 1.5 percent next year, which is
strong by Italy's chronically sluggish standards, 1.6 percent in
2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
    ""These targets are prudent,"" said Tria, brushing off
widespread criticism from independent analysts who have said
they were overly optimistic.
    ""(We will) significantly reduce, within the first two years
of this legislature, the growth gap with the eurozone and bring
about the first significant decrease in the debt ratio over the
next three years,"" Tria said.
    At around 131 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), Italy
has the highest debt ratio in Europe besides that of Greece.
Tria predicted this ratio would fall to 130.0 next year, 128.1
in 2020 and 126.7 in 2021. [nL8N1WL29P]
    The Bank of Italy said on Tuesday there was always a risk of
a vicious circle over debt costs, with repercussions for the
real economy.
    ""Given the (debt's) size and the need to service each year a
not insignificant amount (about 400 billion euros), the danger

said.

    FLORENCE, Italy, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte said on Tuesday the International Monetary Fund's
forecasts for the Italian economy should be revised in light of
the government's 2019 budget proposals. 
    ""The (IMF) forecasts should be updated in respect of our

ratio in the third year will fall under 2 percent ... the same
works for debt/GDP, which we will contain, and will fall,"" Conte
said.
    In the World Economic Outlook published on Tuesday, the IMF 
forecast Italian GDP growth would fall to 1 percent in 2019 from
1.5 percent this year, with the deficit/GDP ration stabilising
at 1.7 percent.

    A further drop in government bond prices could hurt banks'
ability to offer credit, with possible spillover effects on
other European countries, the IMF said.
    The Fund listed Italy, along with France and Spain, among
the eurozone countries with limited budget margins.
    Italy should take advantage of the economic recovery to
build up financial buffers instead of increasing the deficit,
the IMF said.
    The IMF also called on the government to maintain previous

    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Some Italian banks may be forced to
tap investors for cash if the risk that premium domestic bonds
pay over safer German Bunds rises above certain levels, a top
central bank official warned.
    Market concerns over the fiscal profligacy of Italy's new
anti-establishment government have driven the 10-year yield gap
between Italy and Germany above 300 basis points, from 130 in
mid-May before the new coalition's spending plans first leaked.
    ""There are (spread) levels that may force some banks to tap
markets (for cash),"" Bank of Italy Deputy Director General Luigi
Federico Signorini told a parliamentary hearing.
    Filling capital shortfalls could prove difficult for Italian
lenders, which have come under heavy pressure due to their large
holdings of domestic government bonds. [nL8N1WH52F]
    Credit Suisse analysts said on Monday a widening of the
yield differential between Italian and German bonds above 400 
basis points would not be sustainable and would trigger capital
increases.
    Italian lenders have tapped markets in recent years to fund 
a restructuring after a deep recession.
    But weak profitability and growing uncertainty over the
country's prospects could make it hard for them to lure
investors despite extremely cheap market valuations.     
    Signorini also flagged the risk that banks face constraints
in lending because the falling value of their government bond
holdings erode their capital buffers.
    ""The falling value of the government bonds they hold impacts
banks' capital levels. Above a certain threshold, it may hamper
their ability to provide credit to the economy,"" he said.
    Domestic bonds account on average for 10 percent of Italian
banks' overall assets.

 (Adds European Commission reaction, industry comment)
    By Huw Jones and William Schomberg
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of England urged the
European Union on Tuesday to do more to protect cross-border
financial services from the risks of a ""cliff-edge Brexit"",
saying the need for action was now pressing.
    Less than six months before Britain is due to leave the EU,
creating the potential for new barriers for companies doing
business across the English Channel, the BoE said in its
strongest warning so far that it saw risks for insurance,
derivatives and the transfer of data.
    London and Brussels have yet to agree the terms of Britain's
departure from the bloc and their new relationship, a deal that
would mean business as usual until the end of 2020.
    ""There has been considerable progress in the UK to address
these risks, but only limited progress in the EU,"" the central
bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said in a statement
published on Tuesday after a meeting on Oct. 3.
    ""In the limited time remaining, it is not possible for
companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption
to cross-border financial services. The need for authorities to
complete mitigating actions is now pressing.""
    Bankers say Brussels wants to pile pressure on banks,
insurers and fund managers in London to open up new hubs in
rival EU financial centres such as Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin.
    The European Commission said on Tuesday it has consistently
encouraged all stakeholders in financial services to prepare for
Brexit, and that it continued to analyse with the European
Central Bank possible risks for markets.
    The EU executive will review the situation after an EU
summit next week that seeks to finalise Britain's exit deal and
transition period, a Commission spokesman said.
    The industry is also waiting to see what steps if any a
joint BoE and ECB working group will take to keep markets
orderly around Brexit Day.
        
    NO TIME
    Derivatives with a nominal value of 41 trillion pounds would
face legal uncertainty if the EU took no action in the event of
a no-deal Brexit, the BoE said.
    On insurance, even if companies based in Britain complete
planned moves of their European business to the EU before March,
around 9 million policyholders in the bloc would still be under
the shadow of uncertainty after March, it said.
    Britain is approving a law that would temporarily allow EU
financial firms to continue doing business here in the event of
a no-deal Brexit and wants the EU to do likewise, but Brussels
has so far refused.
    ""Financial stability should not be jeopardised in a game of
high-stakes political poker,"" said Catherine McGuinness,
political leader of the City of London financial district.
    LCH in London, which clears most euro-denominated interest
rate swaps, faces having to force EU-based members to shift
their contracts to rivals in the bloc, a costly undertaking.
    LCH had no immediate comment.
    The FPC also said it was keeping its capital buffer rate for
banks unchanged, noting restraint among borrowers, although it
said it was concerned by fast growth in lending to riskier,
highly indebted companies.
    Banks generally hold enough core capital to cope with a
disorderly Brexit, it said.
    Britain's banks are required to meet a so-called
countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) of 1 percent of their
risk-weighted assets as part of BoE efforts to avoid a repeat of
the taxpayer bailouts after the global financial crisis.
    The FPC said it would review the CCyB level at its next
meeting on Nov. 28.

expected on Tuesday to reject the official candidate to head its

    Primoz Dolenc, who has been the bank's deputy governor since
2016, was nominated for the top job last month by President
Borut Pahor.
    But Jozef Horvat, of opposition party conservative New
Slovenia, told parliament he believed Dolenc's record at the
bank meant his credentials were lacking.
    ""It is our belief that the Bank of Slovenia did not perform

resigned in April to take on a position on the EU's Single

    Dolenc, 41, needs the backing of at least 46 out of 90
parliamentary members in a secret ballot to be elected. 
    If chosen, he would also sit on the European Central Bank's
governing council.
    If not, Pahor is likely to nominate a new candidate in the
coming weeks. According to Slovenian legislation there is no
deadline by which a new central bank governor has to be elected.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament on
Tuesday rejected the central bank's deputy governor, Primoz
Dolenc, as the official candidate to take over as bank chief
after most parties gave him the thumbs-down even though he had
the backing of the president.
    With the minority centre-left government unable to agree on
a joint candidate, the outcome suggested it would be some time
before the highly-sensitive top banking job can now be filled.  
    Dolenc, deputy governor since 2016, was nominated for the
job last month by President Borut Pahor but received support on
Tuesday from only 30 parliamentary members with 39 voting
against him in a secret ballot.
    Slovenia lost its vote on the European Central Bank's

resigned to take a position on the EU's Single Resolution Board.
It will regain the vote only after it elects a governor.
    Allegations of money laundering have plagued Slovenia's
banking sector since it came close to seeking an international
bailout in 2013.
    Pahor's office said after the vote that the president
planned to open a three-week tender for new candidates after 
which he will hold discussions with parliamentary parties and
try to come up with a new name ""as soon as possible"".
    Anyone can propose a candidate for the governor but the
president can then choose among the proposed candidates or name
his own candidate. Slovenian law does not set a deadline for
when a new central bank governor must be elected. [nL8N1W52X5]

    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European banking supervisors
have stepped up their monitoring of liquidity levels at Italian
banks after a sharp increase in the country's government bond
yields, although there is no cause for alarm, a senior EU source
said on Tuesday.
    The source told Reuters the monitoring was being carried out
""more intensely than usual"" due to market turmoil in recent
days.
    The checks involve both customer deposits and the interbank
market that banks use to lend to each other without requesting
collateral, the source said, adding that ""no sign of alarm"" had
been detected.
    Both the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank, the
euro zone's single banking supervisor, declined to comment. 
    The ECB, along with national supervisors, regularly monitors
lenders' liquidity conditions and adjusts its monitoring,
including its frequency and depth, during periods of stress or
market volatility, a source at the ECB said. 
    A budget standoff between Rome's anti-establishment

Italy's benchmark 10-year debt costs <IT10YT=RR> to 3.72
percent, the highest level since February 2014. 
    The ruling coalition last month set a deficit target of 2.4
percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous
government's goal for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving
investors and prompting sharp criticism from the European
Commission.
    Italian banks are vulnerable to sovereign debt problems
because they hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds -
or 10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by
hurting the value of those holdings, eats into their capital
levels.
    Shares in the country's lenders have fallen sharply in
recent months and the cost of insuring major banks' debt against
a potential default has increased.
    However, the ample liquidity provided by the ECB during
years of ultra-expansionary monetary policy is shielding the
interbank market from any tensions, Milan traders said.
    Banks have not suffered any deposit flights either, based on
the latest available data. Italian banks' deposits stood at 2.39
trillion euros in July from 2.41 trillion euros in June, when
the new government was sworn in, and have been broadly stable in
recent months.

    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italian European Affairs Minister
Paolo Savona said on Tuesday the government could change its
expansionary 2019 budget plan if market pressure on Italy

    ""If the spread (between Italian benchmark bond yields and

television interview.
   ""I am pretty sure that the spread won't reach 400 (basis
points),"" Savona added, according to Ansa, while repeating a
view he has expressed before that if necessary the European
Central Bank should intervene to ensure market stability.
    Italy's 10-year bond yield spread with Germany reached a
5-year peak of around 312 basis points on Tuesday over concerns
about the budget, before narrowing sharply to 293 points.
    The budget plan outlined this month by the right-wing League
and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement aims to raise next
year's fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product,
tripling the target set by the previous centre-left
administration.

    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The leaders of Italy's ruling
parties said on Tuesday they would permit no change to the
government's 2019 budget plan, despite financial market pressure
and criticism from the country's central bank and the
parliamentary fiscal watchdog.
    Speaking jointly to reporters, Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi
Di Maio and Matteo Salvini reiterated they would not change the
target of a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product for next year.
    That was three times the forecast of the previous
centre-left administration and sparked criticism from the
European Commission and a rise in yields on Italian government
bonds.
    Backtracking on the budget would mean ""betraying the
Italians"", said Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement.
    Salvini, who leads the right-wing League, said he was
convinced the expansionary budget would yield economic growth of
2 percent next year, rather than the 1.5 percent official
forecast the government set this month.
    Italy's fiscal watchdog, the parliamentary budget office
(UPB), earlier on Tuesday refused to validate the government's
multi-year budget plan, saying its forecasts for economic growth
were too optimistic.
    The planning document projected growth targets of 1.5
percent next year, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
    The government can ignore the UPB's verdict, but if it does
so parliament can call on the economy minister to explain why.
    The Bank of Italy warned on Tuesday that lowering the
retirement age, as the government plans, could put the
sustainability of the pension system at risk.
    Di Maio shot back that the 2011 reform that hiked the
retirement age, approved by a technocratic government, had ""not
been voted for by anybody,"" and those who want to maintain it
should have the courage to run for government.
    Salvini said the people and institutions now criticising the
government's plans were those who had ""brought Italy to
disaster"".
    Shortly before Di Maio and Salvini spoke, Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte said on Facebook the government would not change
its fiscal targets but ""strengthen"" the budget by beefing up
plans for investment.
    Conte, who is close to 5-Star but not a member of either
ruling party, said he would hold a meeting on Wednesday with
state-owned companies to begin putting together a National
Investment Plan.

    CENBANK: Czech consumer prices in September fell the most on
a monthly basis since 2015 due to deep discounts for holiday
tours and train tickets, a small respite from inflationary
pressures that continue to keep rate hikes in the cards.
    After the data, central bank Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl -
viewed as the biggest proponent of steady rate hikes but whose
final term on the Czech National Bank's seven-member board ends
soon - said there was little reason to change his view.

    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Even before any Brexit deal has
been concluded between the UK and Brussels, attention is turning
to whether it will get through a delicately balanced UK
parliament. With the support of the Northern Irish DUP, Theresa
May has a majority of just 13 but various estimates put at 40
the number of Conservative MPs who are prepared to defy her and
vote down any deal. Set against that are reports in The Times
and FT this morning that between 30-40 Labour lawmakers would
rebel against their party leadership and back May's deal for
fear that the alternative is a dire, no-deal Brexit. There is
still a long way to go on this one: the party whip system under
which various forms of pressure and inducements are applied on
recalcitrant parliamentarians has yet to make itself fully felt.
    What has happened to Emmanuel Macron's cabinet reshuffle,
originally expected on Monday and then put back to yesterday?
Finally a statement emerged from the Elysee yesterday evening to
say that it would not be happening just yet; Macron is due to
hold a regular cabinet meeting this morning before he heads off
on an official trip to Armenia. The opposition is having a field
day, accusing him of dithering and making a huge fuss over
something which is largely a presentational move. One of the
downsides of having sprung open the established party system
with his En Marche movement is that Macron has not got an
obvious pool of ministerial candidates to choose from. And as
his government looks more and more uncertain in office, some
possible names are even ruling themselves out.
    Italian government officials have come out this morning to
insist there will be no change to the 2019 budget and its growth
targets after parliament's fiscal watchdog said the forecasts -
for 1.5 percent growth next year, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4
percent in 2021 - were too optimistic. The government can indeed
ignore that judgment, but if it does so parliament can call on
the economy minister to explain why.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    World markets’ volatile start to the week petered out
somewhat on Wednesday as key flash points in U.S. Treasuries,
emerging markets and Italian debt calmed down and eyes shifted
to critical U.S. inflation updates, debt auctions and the start
of the Q3 earnings season later this week. Sterling continued to
stand out as it pushed to its strongest levels in four months
against the euro and on a trade-weighted basis following a
series of reports that a Brexit deal between the European Union
and Britain could be reached as soon as next week. Italian
government bond yields and debt spreads versus Germany hovered
close to Tuesday’s closing levels and off their highest levels
this week after finance minister Tria said the government would
act if bond market pricing became excessive and European banking
monitors said stepped-up surveillance of Italian banks’
liquidity position showed up no cause for alarm. 
    After surging to 7-year highs above 3.26 percent yesterday
and unnerving world equity markets in the process, 10-year U.S.
Treasury yields slipped back to hover just above 3.20 percent
first thing Wednesday ahead of a 10-year auction later tonight.
With markets now starting to chime with Fed indications of
another four interest rate rises between now and the end of next
year, the release later today of U.S. producer price data for
September and the consumer price report tomorrow will be
important in determining the next twist in the bond market. Some
traders pointed to further criticism of the Fed overnight from
U.S. President Trump, who said the central bank was tightening
too fast, but the impact of that political pressure could just
as easily embolden Fed policymakers to stick to their course. 
    After cutting world growth forecasts this week by 0.2
percentage points for this year and next, the International
Monetary Fund’s Financial Stability Report on Wednesday
spotlighted the risks of mounting pressure points on the world
economy, not least various financial firestorms across the
emerging markets. Helped by a pause in rising U.S. yields and
step-back in the dollar on Wednesday, emerging market equities
turned slightly positive for the first time in five sessions.
Chinese stock markets and the yuan were flat during the day
after a seismic start to the week saw the biggest one-day equity
market fall in more than 2 years. Tokyo’s Nikkei ended
marginally in the black, but South Korea’s Kospi lost more than
1 percent amid some disappointment that the second summit
between Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un was delayed to
next month.  Emerging Asia currencies steadied too after a
torrid start to the week and Tuesday's effective devaluation of
Pakistan’s rupee. South Africa’s rand held most of Tuesday’s
sharp gains after news that former central bank chief Mboweni
would take over the job of finance minister after the
resignation of scandal-tainted incumbent Nene. Turkey’s lira was
also steady after the government announced a series of price
control measures and discounting to try to control runaway
inflation that hit almost 25 percent last month.

the ceiling on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) Greek banks
draw from the domestic central bank by 200 million euros to 5.0
billion euros ($5.74 billion), the Bank of Greece said on
Wednesday.
    The move reflected improved liquidity conditions, taking
into account private sector deposit flows and banks' access to
financial markets, it said. The ELA ceiling is valid through to
Nov 7.
    Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) since February 2015 after being cut off from the ECB's
funding window. Emergency funding is more costly than borrowing
directly from the ECB.
    In June 2016 the ECB reinstated Greek banks' access to its
cheap funding operations, allowing lenders to reduce their
dependence on the emergency liquidity lifeline.
    But with Athens out of its bailout programe since August 21
this year, the ECB has ended a waiver that made Greek government
bonds eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

caused by external factors, not the health of the country's

    Greek banking stocks have lost more than 40 percent so far
this year, and the selling pressure grew in recent days.

    Those factors include rising interest rates generally and in
Greece's neighbouring countries in particular.
    ""The ongoing improvement of the liquidity situation of Greek
banks reflects the improved condition of the Greek financial
system,"" Stournaras said.
    On Wednesday, the European Central Bank lowered the ceiling

    By Gernot Heller and Rene Wagner
    BERLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The German government has cut its
forecasts for growth this year and next in Europe's largest
economy and sees an escalation in the global trade dispute as
the main risk for the future, a document seen by Reuters on
Wednesday showed.
    The government - due to present its updated forecasts on
Thursday - slashed its 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts to 1.8
percent, compared with its previous predictions of 2.3 percent
and 2.1 percent respectively, the document showed.
    It blamed weak global trade, reduced state consumption,
revisions to previously reported data and slower production in
the auto sector due to difficulties adjusting to a new pollution
standard.
    Risks for the German economy include Britain's looming
departure from the European Union and threat of economic crises
in Turkey and Argentina spreading to other emerging economies,
the document showed.
    The German government expects the economy to expand by 1.8
percent in 2020, the document showed.
    It said domestic demand remained strong but that the global
economic environment was increasingly difficult.
    Traditionally driven by exports, the German economy - now in
its ninth year of expansion - relies heavily on household
spending to grow as consumers enjoy record-high employment,
rising real wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
    Due to an increasingly tight labour market, characterized by
low unemployment and more than a million job vacancies, the
government expects nominal wages to rise by 3.0 percent this
year and by 3.1 percent in both 2019 and 2020.
    With inflation, predicted to rise to 1.9 percent this year
and 2.0 percent in 2019, the wage hikes mean that German
consumers will have more money to spend also in real terms.
    ""In view of the strong expansion of disposable income and
moderate inflation, private consumption is likely to pick up
noticeably,"" the document said.
    Household spending is projected to grow by 1.6 percent in
2018 and by 2.0 percent in 2019.
    Provisional budgeting in the first half of this year caused
by an unusually long coalition building period means that state
spending will be postponed into next year, it said.
    State consumption is projected to rise by 1.4 percent this
year and by 2.5 percent next while state investments are seen
jumping by 5.9 percent in 2018 and by 5.2 percent in 2019.

Board members present at the meeting: Mugur Isărescu, Chairman
of the Board and Governor of the National Bank of Romania;
Florin Georgescu, Vice Chairman of the Board and First Deputy
Governor of the National Bank of Romania; Eugen Nicolăescu,
Board member and Deputy Governor of the National Bank of
Romania; Liviu Voinea, Board member and Deputy Governor of the
National Bank of Romania; Marin Dinu, Board member; Daniel
Dăianu, Board member; Gheorghe Gherghina, Board member; Ágnes
Nagy, Board member; and Virgiliu-Jorj Stoenescu, Board member.

During the meeting, the Board discussed and adopted the monetary
policy decision, based on the data and analyses on current and
future macroeconomic, financial and monetary developments
submitted by the specialised departments, as well as on other
available domestic and external information.

Looking at the recent evolution of inflation, Board members
noted that it had been in line with expectations. The annual
inflation rate had seen a significant downward correction in
July to 4.56 percent from 5.4 percent in the previous month,
reaching 5.06 percent in August, i.e. slightly below the
forecast. The fall versus June had been particularly induced by
administered prices and fuel prices, mainly against the backdrop
of some base effects. The developments in vegetable and fruit
prices had had opposite influences, albeit of a lower magnitude.

It was remarked that core inflation as well had further
contributed to the inflation slowdown, although only marginally,
with the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate remaining
virtually flat at 2.9 percent in July and subsequently declining
to 2.8 percent in August, i.e. slightly below the forecast. The
decline had been supported, that time too, by processed food and
services, more visibly influenced by the dynamics of
international prices of some agri-food items, including the
associated base effects, as well as by the relative appreciation
of the leu against the euro. An opposite effect worth mentioning
had had the dynamics of non-food prices. Some Board members were
of the view that, overall, core inflation was further marked by
the unexpectedly sudden loss of momentum of consumer demand in
2018 Q1, associated with the moderation of the cyclical position
of the economy, likely to exert an inertial influence on the
price-setting behaviour on certain retail trade segments. Unit
labour costs had, however, retained their double-digit annual
dynamics in Q2 or had increased at faster rates, while
short-term inflation expectations had remained elevated.
Moreover, GDP deflator had continued to rise, while the annual
growth rate of industrial producer prices of non-durables on the
domestic market had turned upwards June through July.

Looking at the cyclical position of the economy, Board members
first remarked the strong slowdown in the economy’s rate of
increase versus last year. At the same time, it was noted that
in Q2 the economic growth had seen, however, a slight
re-acceleration, in annual terms, to 4.1 percent from 4.0
percent in Q1, given the step-up in its quarterly dynamics. That
was indicative of a larger-than-expected re-widening of the
excess aggregate demand April through June. Private consumption
had continued to be the main driver of the economic advance,
making an even somewhat higher contribution, as a result of the
unexpected acceleration in its annual dynamics. It had been
closely followed by the change in inventories, whose
contribution to GDP dynamics had reached a 5-year high, whereas
the contribution of gross fixed capital formation had turned
negative again, amid the new contraction in annual terms
reported by that component, after three quarters of growth in a
row. Some Board members warned that the evolution was a matter
of concern, considering the economy’s growth potential over the
medium term. The contribution of net exports to the advance in
GDP had remained negative, yet had diminished somewhat, in the
context of a clearer deceleration in the growth rate of imports
than in that of exports. The current account deficit had seen a
small contraction versus 2017 Q2, on account of the improved
balance on primary income. It was also shown that, on the supply
side, the economic growth had benefited from an almost general
support. The services sector had been further the main engine of
growth, albeit making a somewhat lower contribution, whereas the
industrial sector had had a notable, constant contribution.

Board members observed that the statistical data indicated a
renewed labour market tightening in Q2. The ILO unemployment
rate had posted a new quarterly decline to hit a historical low
of 4.2 percent in May, remaining flat at this level through July
as well, while the job vacancy rate had gone up for the second
consecutive quarter. The number of employees economy-wide had
continued to reach new highs, while its annual dynamics had
stopped trending downwards in July, given the slight
re-acceleration in its growth rate in the private sector, for
the first time since 2017 Q1. Board members concluded that
pressures on wages would be further on the rise in the near
term, given the improvement in employment intentions in 2018 Q4,
shown by surveys, as well as the higher difficulties in
recruiting skilled labour. In that context, mention was made of
the re-acceleration seen in Q2 by the annual growth rate of
average gross nominal wage earnings, as well as of the
double-digit range within which the indicator had remained in
July, amid its slight moderation. At the same time, reference
was made to the pick-up reported for the second straight quarter
by the annual change in unit wage costs in industry, followed,
however, by a marked decline in July.

Turning to discussions on monetary conditions, Board members
showed that key interbank money market rates had seen their
positive spread vis-à-vis the monetary policy rate narrow
gradually after the resumption of repos by the central bank,
while remaining at a high level. Some Board members highlighted
that the spread was relevant from the perspective of judging the
monetary policy stance. Reference was made to the continued
relative stability of the EUR/RON exchange rate over the recent
months, most likely attributable to the considerable
differential of interest rates on the local market versus those
prevailing in Europe and regionally.

It was noted that the robust growth of credit to the private
sector had extended into July and August, at an annual pace of
6.6 percent in each month – only marginally below the Q2 average
and slightly above the Q1 reading. In turn, the dynamics of the
leu-denominated component had stuck to double-digit levels,
while following a somewhat steeper downtrend, primarily on the
back of housing loans and credit to non-financial corporations.
However, the share of the domestic currency component in total
private sector credit had further widened in July, before
sticking to 65.3 percent in August.

As regards future developments, based on the latest data and
analyses, Board members shared the view that the annual
inflation rate would probably decline further in the near run,
in line with the medium-term forecast published in the August
2018 Inflation Report, which anticipated its drop to 3.5 percent
in December 2018 and then to 2.7 percent at end-2019. It was
stated that the significant downward correction in inflation
developments expected for Q4 was mainly ascribable to the base
effects associated with the previous year’s increases in all CPI
exogenous components: administered prices, fuel prices, tobacco
product prices and VFE prices. The disinflationary contribution
of supply-side factors was, however, seen to be more modest than
in the latest medium-term forecast, given the unexpected hike in
the electricity price in August, as well as the relative
increase in oil prices. The latter might, nevertheless, exceed
again expectations over the short time horizon,
higher-than-anticipated rises being also possible in the case of
some administered prices and the prices of some food items,
owing to the African swine fever outbreak, the evolution of some
grain prices on the international market, and to the sudden
worsening of weather conditions in September. Some Board members
cautioned that, were such adverse developments to materialise,
the risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations would become
increasingly relevant.

Examining the likely trend of inflationary pressures from the
cyclical position of the economy, Board members noted that the
new assessments reconfirmed the prospects for a marked
deceleration in the annual economic growth in Q3 – largely on
the back of negative base effects –, followed by a more modest
re-acceleration in 2018 Q4, as quarterly GDP dynamics were
expected to slow visibly versus Q2 and only marginally from the
earlier forecast. It was shown that such an evolution implied a
slightly slower widening of the positive output gap during the
second half of the year than in the August forecast, yet at
somewhat higher values than previously anticipated, as a result
of its reopening above expectations in Q2.

In addition, it was observed that, according to the latest
developments in high-frequency indicators, private consumption
had remained the engine of economic growth in Q3 too, but also a
major determinant of its deceleration. In turn, gross fixed
capital formation may have made a more negative contribution to
GDP dynamics during that period, the same as net exports, given
that the differential between the annual growth rate of exports
of goods and that of imports had become negative again in July,
while the surplus on services had followed a steeper downward
path versus the same year-earlier period. Against that
background, in the first month of Q3, the current account
deficit had widened again at a faster rate in annual terms.
Deficit financing seemed, however, to be adequate in the opinion
of some Board members, who nonetheless cautioned about the
reduction in the share of autonomous financing in 2017.

In light of the mixed developments, Board members deemed that
the uncertainties and risks surrounding the latest medium-term
inflation forecast remained significant. Reference was made to
the relative volatility of consumer confidence, which had
however recently re-embarked on an upward path, as well as to
the likely evolution of households’ real disposable income,
inter alia amid the renewed tightening of labour market
conditions, but also amid the potential developments in fuel and
utility prices. Mention was also made of the lower-than-planned
EU funds absorption and public investment spending, with
unfavourable implications for the dynamics of gross fixed
capital formation and ultimately for the internal and external
equilibria of the economy, as well as of the legislative
initiatives on the banking sector, with a potential adverse
impact on lending to non-financial corporations.

Discussions also touched upon the risks to euro area’s economic
performance induced by trade protectionism and the Brexit
uncertainties, as well as by the situation in Italy and the
global financial market volatility. Reference was implicitly
made to the ECB’s monetary policy stance and to its relevance in
terms of the decisions taken by central banks in the region. The
recent financial turmoil in some emerging economies was also
mentioned, while its spillover effects were deemed as modest and
confined to the vulnerable economies in terms of macroeconomic
fundamentals. Against that background, Board members underlined
again the need for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix, to avoid
the overburdening of monetary policy, with undesired effects in
the economy. Moreover, most Board members reiterated the
importance of an adequate dosage and pace of adjustment of the
monetary policy stance, from the perspective of anchoring
inflation expectations and maintaining the annual inflation rate
on the trajectory shown by the NBR’s latest medium-term
forecast, while safeguarding financial stability.

Under the circumstances, the NBR Board unanimously decided to
keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent, the
deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent and the lending (Lombard)
facility rate at 3.50 percent. In addition, the NBR Board
unanimously decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum
reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign
currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions.

    * Fiscal compliance should be assessed only on primary
expenditure
    * Proposal comes as Italy, Commission spar on next year's
budget

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Union should
change its budget rules to make them more effective in bringing
down public debts, EU fiscal advisers said in a report on
Wednesday, urging the bloc to scrap deficit targets for
countries where debt is falling.
    The publication of the report coincides with a row between
Italy and Brussels over the country's 2019 budget, in which the
eurosceptic Italian government plans to flout EU fiscal rules to
fulfil electoral promises of government largesse.
    The European Fiscal Board, which advises on the EU's
supervision of member states' budgetary plans, said the existing
budget rules are too complex and have largely failed to improve
the long-term sustainability of public finances in several EU
states.
    The report highlighted that improvements in EU countries'
fiscal positions in past years largely came from higher growth.
It also said that an opportunity to reduce high debt levels
faster was missed.
    The Fiscal Board's report suggested getting rid of existing
deficit targets, which require structural adjustments and a
nominal ceiling of 3 percent of the gross domestic product.
Instead, the Commission should focus exclusively on reducing the
debt, the report said.
    ""The debt-to-GDP ratio should be the anchor of the new
simplified fiscal framework. This choice ensures that long-term
debt sustainability in the member states remains the ultimate
objective of the rules,"" the report said.
    Under the proposal, countries which maintain their primary
expenditure below a set ceiling over a three-year period - and
therefore are set to lower their debt - could be considered in
line with EU rules even if they run excess deficits. 
    Advisers also proposed scrapping structural deficit targets
as a way of assessing fiscal compliance.
    The proposal could be welcomed in countries like Italy which
call for larger deficits. The Commission last week warned Italy
that its budgetary plans for next year were at risk of breaching
the structural deficit requirement.
    But even under the Fiscal Board's proposals, Italy would be
likely to be non-compliant as the country's debt is not on a
credible downward path.
    The report said debt should remain below 60 percent of GDP,
in line with current requirements, but proposed a longer
adjustment period of 15 years to reach the target.
    Italy has a debt above 130 percent of GDP. The Italian
government says its expansionary budget will reduce the debt by
increasing growth, but experts agree the expected output is
over-optimistic.
    Advisers also recommended making sanctions for offenders
more gradual and effective as existing penalties have never been
applied.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - There is no
immediate danger of Italy losing market access or being

has underlying strengths, the head of the euro zone bailout fund
ESM Klaus Regling said on Thursday.
    In a panel discussion at an event at the International

debt crisis in Europe.
    ""There is no immediate danger for Italy to lose access to
the markets, there is no immediate danger of it being downgraded
below investment grade, they are still two notches above,""
Regling said.
    Regling noted that during the Greek debt crisis, Italy never
lost market access because of the underlying strengths of its
economy.
    ""Despite the high debt levels, the fiscal deficit was never
excessively high, the primary surplus was quite sizeable, Italy
has a current account surplus and Italian private domestic
savings are very strong, and a large share of Italian government
bonds are in the hands of residents,"" Regling said.
    Italy's populist government raised market concern when it
announced two weeks ago a plan to raise its headline budget gap
to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 and keep it
there in 2020 and 2021. 
    This would mean also a higher structural deficit - the
balance which excludes one offs and business cycle effects - and
higher debt in a country which already has a debt to GDP ratio
of 133 percent, the second highest in Europe.
    ""I don't like the announcements on fiscal targets for the
next three years because they are not in line with the European
fiscal framework which was adopted by all governments including
the Italian government at the time,"" Regling said.
    Pressure from investors selling Italian debt and from euro
zone peers made Rome lower the deficit targets for 2020 to 2.1
percent and to 1.8 percent in 2021, but euro zone officials said
it was not nearly enough, as Italian debt would still rise.
    ""We already saw that the Italian government made some
adjustments during the last few weeks, so I hope this is not the
end of the story,"" Regling said.
    ""But at the same time, let's not forget that there are some
underlying strengths so there is no reason to immediately expect
now the worst,"" Regling said.
    Italian benchmark 10-year bonds <IT10YT=TWEB> still held at
4.5 year highs of 3.543 percent on Thursday, though slightly off
the peak of 3.697 percent on Tuesday.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Euro zone corporate debt will be
hit harder and faster than government bonds by the withdrawal of
massive European Central Bank support, which means companies
will see funding costs rise and investors will need to
scrutinise borrowers more carefully.     
    Confident that the economy is in decent shape and inflation
is picking up, the ECB appears set to end its $2.6 trillion ($3
trillion) asset purchase scheme in December. 
    The big unwind from an era of easy money is already under
way - overall ECB monthly bond buying dropped by half in
October. But the end of quantitative easing (QE) comes with a
bigger bump for corporate bonds than for government debt, which
will continue to see massive inflows for some time thanks to
reinvestments from maturing debt already held by the ECB.
    As a result, several European companies are already finding
new debt and refinancing conditions tighter. Corporate borrowing
costs relative to those of governments have risen by around 50
basis points this year, and the pool of negative-yielding
corporate bonds is at its lowest since June 2016.
    Last month, the ECB bought 30 billion euros of debt, which
includes 4.5 billion of corporate bonds, according to analyst
estimates. With monthly purchases cut in half this month, buying
of corporate bonds is estimated at 2.5 billion euros.

    READY OR NOT
    As the ECB's sizeable presence unwinds, the corporate bond
market is already starting to feel the effects. Higher funding
costs could also reduce appetite for mergers and acquisitions,
or push corporates back to the loan market for more concessional
borrowing, bankers and investors said.
    German media company Bertelsmann was unable to find enough
demand to print a seven-year euro-denominated bond in May after
offering a starting price of 45 basis points over mid-swaps, a
risk-free benchmark.
    Bertelsmann returned to the market last month with a
slightly shorter tenor and a starting price of 85 basis points.
The deal, which raised 750 million euros, was finally priced at
65 basis points over. [nL8N1WB3RI]
    ""Companies like Bertelsmann have seen their funding costs
blow out,"" said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate
at Barclays Bank.
    ""You can't see any clearer indication as the end of the
effect of CSPP on the corporate bond market,"" he said, referring
to the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme, the ECB's name for
its corporate bond buying scheme.
    A Bertelsmann spokesperson declined to comment.  
    Bankers and dealers said this factor was only beginning to
surface in the primary market.
    ""We've not had that much issuance since QE was tapered at
the start of October, so I don't think the impact has been felt
yet,"" said a debt syndicate banker in London.
    The segment of the market most at risk is the 25 billion
euros of high yield bonds which only just qualify for ECB
purchases because they have an investment grade rating from one
ratings agency, bankers said. Of this, 19 billion euros of bonds
appear on the ECB's purchase list.
    Access to cheaper funding led to an ""explosion"" in the
amount of single BBB-rated paper in Europe, which is now the
""most mispriced"" segment of the market, Baldini said.
    
    UNCERTAINTY
    ECB QE, launched in March 2015, first focused on the biggest
and most liquid government bond markets but was extended to
include corporate bonds in June 2016. Economists estimate the
ECB now owns about a fifth of the stock of eligible corporate
bonds, versus about a quarter of eligible government debt. 
    Without a boost from ECB buying, bond prices will
increasingly reflect market factors, said Edward Farley, head of
European corporate bonds at PGIM Fixed Income.
    ""Ultimately, this means there will be more focus on
fundamentals and getting those right because you don't have
anybody propping up the market in an artificial way.""
    As a result, the difference between corporate and government
bond yields has widened and the pool of negative-yielding
investment-grade corporate bonds is shrinking.[nL8N1WI1XB]
    (For interactive chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OzhvIJ)
    ""The whole corporate bond market has gone through a drastic
repricing,"" said Baldini at Barclays. 
    He said anticipation of the end of QE has helped push the
euro-denominated European Aggregate Corporate BBB index 50 basis
points wider from January to September, more than double the
widening of the U.S. equivalent. 
    Investment grade corporate bonds still retain a QE premium,
so further spread-widening is likely said Stephen Caprio, global
credit strategist at UBS.
    Farley said the end of QE marks an opportunity, because
prices more accurately reflect risk. Previously, his firm had
been ""very underweight"" ECB-eligible names, because bond spreads
traded so tight.
    ""New issues are now coming at sensible levels rather than
ECB compressed levels,"" he said. ""There are plenty of reasonably
attractive opportunities that just simply weren't there before.""

must do more to support global demand as interest rates rise,
making it more expensive for debtors to pay their dues, European
Central Bank policymaker Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on

    Rising rates in the United States have squeezed debtors in
emerging economies from Argentina to Turkey and the euro zone
has some issues of its own with borrowing costs surging in Italy
due to worries about the new government's plans to raise its

Indonesia.    
    ""These results support the recommendations to creditors to
increase their contribution to global demand in order to support
adjustment of global disequilibrium,"" de Cos said. 
    ""On the debtors' side the lack of automatic adjustment
through exchange rate shifts suggests the need to boost
competitiveness through structural reforms.""
     Higher rates in developed economies, particularly in the
United States, is pressuring emerging markets as funds get
sucked out. That has seen a selloff in emerging market
currencies, raising financial risks in countries with current

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Euro zone corporate debt will be
hit harder and faster than government bonds by the withdrawal of
massive European Central Bank support, which means companies
will see funding costs rise and investors will need to
scrutinise borrowers more carefully.     
    Confident that the economy is in decent shape and inflation
is picking up, the ECB appears set to end its 2.6 trillion
euros($3 trillion) asset purchase scheme in December. 
    The big unwind from an era of easy money is already under
way - overall ECB monthly bond buying dropped by half in
October. But the end of quantitative easing (QE) comes with a
bigger bump for corporate bonds than for government debt, which
will continue to see massive inflows for some time thanks to
reinvestments from maturing debt already held by the ECB.
    As a result, several European companies are already finding
new debt and refinancing conditions tighter. Corporate borrowing
costs relative to those of governments have risen by around 50
basis points this year, and the pool of negative-yielding
corporate bonds is at its lowest since June 2016.
    Last month, the ECB bought 30 billion euros of debt, which
includes 4.5 billion of corporate bonds, according to analyst
estimates. With monthly purchases cut in half this month, buying
of corporate bonds is estimated at 2.5 billion euros.
    But next year, when purchases are likely to be limited to
reinvestment of maturing debt, corporate debt's share will
shrink faster than that of government debt.
    ECB data shows a monthly average of just 470 million euros

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank is in no rush to provide more clarity on how its easy
monetary policy would be tightened, but it will move only very
gradually, policymakers said on the sidelines of the IMF's
annual meeting on Thursday. 
    The ECB has given guidance that asset purchases would end in
December and interest rates would be held steady through next
summer, but has avoided giving more detail, arguing that
inflation developments would be factored in and policy was not
simply on auto pilot.
    ""To be any more precise than that, to lock in a date, to tie
our hands would be rather risky,"" Ardo Hansson, Estonia's
central bank chief said as the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank began on the
Indonesian island of Bali. 
    ""When we get closer, we can have another discussion if we
need to adjust the language again, but this is not a debate we
are going to have just yet,"" Hansson said.
    While most policymakers have argued that the wording implies
no move before the end of the summer, Dutch policymaker Klaas
Knot, an outspoken hawk, recently argued that the guidance was
the midpoint of expectations and the actual move could be ""to
the left or the right of that point"".
    Some uncertainty over inflation may be blurring the outlook,
as underlying price pressures remain weak despite accelerating
wage growth and record employment, a somewhat puzzling outcome
which suggests some invisible slack in the euro zone economy.
    The ECB has undershot its medium term inflation target -
currently set at close to but below 2 percent - for over five
years and its projections show only a very gradual rise even
after years of stimulus. 
    ""Core inflation is still rather weak in the euro zone at
around 1 percent, as it has been for the last couple of years,
so an accommodative monetary policy is still needed in Europe,""
Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said in Bali.
    But Rehn added that rebuilding some of the ECB's firepower
before the next downturn was needed, even if unconventional
policy tools will remain permanent part of its arsenal.

    MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Worsening investor
sentiment caused by the new government’s fiscal binge is hurting
the country’s banks. The weakest ones, like Carige, need
capital, but may struggle to raise it. Either rescuing a bank or
shutting it down would be politically toxic.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Rating agency Fitch on Oct. 10 downgraded Banca Carige’s
long-term rating to CCC-plus from B-minus, saying there was a
“real possibility” the Italian bank could fail.
    - The rating firm said it would be “challenging” for Carige
to replenish its Tier 2 capital buffer, which is currently below
the level demanded by regulators.
    - The European Central Bank has given Carige until the end
of the year to plug the capital hole or find a partner.
Carige’s restructuring has been delayed by a boardroom dispute.
Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino was replaced in September.
    - Carige shares were down 10.2 percent at 0.0044 euros by
0840 GMT. The stock has fallen about 45 percent since the start
of the year.

Tony Blair said there was a 50-50 chance of getting another
Brexit referendum as Prime Minister Theresa May will be unlikely
to secure a majority for any divorce deal in parliament.
    ""Whatever Brexit is on offer today is going to result in
significant economic harm,"" Blair, who served as prime minister
from 1997 to 2007, told Reuters.
    ""I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped, I
think there is no majority in parliament for any proposition
that the prime minister brings back,"" Blair said, adding that he
wanted a second referendum.
    Less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from
the European Union, there is little clarity about how the
world's fifth largest economy and its preeminent international
financial centre will trade with the EU after Brexit.
    May is trying to clinches a deal but there is uncertainty on
whether she could sell it at home, where she will need approval
from the British parliament.
    Blair said European regulators would not want the centre of
European finance to be outside their orbit so jobs would be lost
in the financial sector.
    ""Why give ourselves this problem in a field of the global
economy where we are globally preeminent?"" Blair said, adding
that the government had cast aside the interests of the service
sector.
    Blair said that if Brexit did go ahead and was followed by a
Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, then the country would
face a ""truly damaging and challenging situation"".
    ""This is the problem with the policies of both major
parties: they seem to think you can do Brexit and then engage is
a whole lot of social legislation to make capitalism fairer and
more equal and so on,"" Blair said.
    ""They have got to wake up to the fact that if you do Brexit
your number one priority is going to be keeping this place as an
attractive place for investors to come.""

slow euro zone growth further, and European Central Bank
policymakers debated last month whether to downgrade their risk
assessment, minutes of their September meeting showed on
Thursday.
    But policymakers ultimately decided that the domestic
economy was showing considerable resilience, so risks to growth
remained balanced, even if some argued that the factors behind
the recent slowdown may not be temporary, the ECB said in the
accounts of the Sept 13 meeting.
    The ECB kept policy unchanged as expected last month,
staying on track to wrap up a 2.6 trillion-euro ($3
trillion)bond purchases scheme this year and raise interest
rates next autumn, even as it warned that risks from
protectionism were growing [nL5N1VZ1K2].
    ""A remark was made that some of the factors behind the
(downward growth) revisions might not be entirely of a
transitory nature,"" the minutes showed. ""It was also argued that
there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to
domestic demand."" 
    Still, while some policymakers argued that the case could be
made for downgrading the risk assessment, there was agreement
that the underlying strength of the economy would mitigate the
downside risks to activity.
    Rate setters also concluded that the actual impact of trade
tensions has been limited so far, even if there could still be
an impact over time.
    ""High-frequency indicators had stabilised and remained at
elevated levels, underlining the overall robustness of economic
activity,"" chief economist Peter Praet told policymakers,
according to the minutes.
    With years of unprecedented stimulus are finally lifting
inflation and the ECB has been dialling back support, but only
by the smallest of increments, fearing that bigger moves risked
unravelling its work. 
    While the ECB has not explicitly pledged any rate hikes,
policymakers, including Praet, have argued that they were
comfortable with market expectation for a small increase in the
fourth quarter of 2019, followed by only small and infrequent
moves [nL8N1WB23P].
    Policymakers also concluded that domestic cost pressures
continued to build and broaden, indicating that inflation would
rise, moving back towards the bank's target of almost 2 percent
after undershooting it for over five years. 
    A slowdown in growth and the rising threat of protectionism
has also been adding to the ECB's caution. Some policymakers
have warned that external risks, ranging from trade tensions to
an emerging market shakeout and Brexit, could derail global
growth.
    Indeed, earlier this week the International Monetary Fund
cut its global economic growth forecast for this year and next,
saying that the U.S.-China trade war was taking a toll and
emerging markets were struggling with tighter liquidity and
capital outflows [nL2N1WP03N].

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - European Commission Vice
President Jyrki Katainen urged Italy on Thursday to submit a
draft budget in line with commitments and warned of risks for
Italy and other euro zone states.
    Italy's eurosceptic government raised market concern when it
announced two weeks ago a plan to raise its headline budget gap
to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 and flout
fiscal targets agreed with euro zone peers.
    ""The situation is very fragile,"" Katainen told reporters
when asked about Italy's budgetary plans and initially negative
market reaction. He said no one wanted financial instability
that could hit Italy and other euro zone countries ""that may
suffer from contagion risks"".
    On Wednesday, the governor of the Bank of Greece said a drop
in Greek bank shares was caused by external factors, as analysts
blamed Italy's row with the EU over its budget as the main cause
of market pressure on Greek lenders [nL8N1WQ1NS].
    Katainen, who is responsible for jobs and growth, said the
Commission was trying to convince Italy to change its budget
plans, which are likely to flout EU fiscal rules.
    ""Everybody has seen the situation in the markets, which is
not positive,"" he said, referring to reaction to the Italian
plans. ""Our interest is to get a result which is credible and
try to convince the Italian government to take responsibility.""
    All euro zone states have to submit their draft budgets for
next year to Brussels by Oct. 15. The Commission could reject
Italy's plan if it is found in breach of fiscal rules.
    ""We do hope we can get good cooperation with the Italian
government,"" Katainen said.
    He added: ""It is not too late to maintain stability. It is
not too late to make sure that growth can continue in Italy. It
is not too late to show that public financing in Italy is on a
credible path.""
    Last week, the Commission sent a letter to the Italian
government warning its budget plans were a reason for ""serious
concern"" as they appeared to deviate significantly from agreed
fiscal targets. [nL8N1WM0IR]

target of 0.7 percent of GDP appears to be within reach, the
Bank of Portugal said on Thursday, also confirming its previous
economic growth estimate of 2.3 percent, which is in line with
the government's forecast.
    ""The target, of 0.7 percent deficit, appears feasible 
considering the seasonal profile of half-yearly deficits,
although it still involves some uncertainty,"" the central bank
said in its autumn economic bulletin. 
    The targeted deficit would be the narrowest in over four
decades of Portugal's democratic history, coming four years
after its exit from an international bailout programme.
    The central bank also revised last year's growth higher to
2.8 percent from 2.7 percent, which was the strongest rate of
expansion since the turn of the century.
    The slowdown this year is mainly due to a weaker exports
growth, which the central projects at 5 percent after last
year's 7.8 percent, and gross fixed capital formation, seen
growing 3.9 percent this year after 9.2 percent in 2017.

    By Balazs Koranyi
    FRANKFURT, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Global trade tensions could
slow euro zone growth further and European Central Bank
policymakers debated last month whether to downgrade their risk
assessment, minutes of their September meeting showed on
Thursday.
    But policymakers ultimately concluded that the domestic
economy was showing enough resilience to consider risks broadly
balanced, even if some argued that the factors behind the recent
slowdown may not be temporary as earlier thought, the ECB said
in the accounts of the Sept 13 meeting.
    The ECB kept policy unchanged as expected last month,
staying on track to wrap up a 2.6 trillion-euro ($3
trillion)bond purchases scheme this year and raise interest
rates next autumn, continuing its slow but steady pace of policy
tightening. [nL5N1VZ1K2].
    Indeed, even as trade tensions weighed on growth and a stock
market selloff amplified growth fears, some policymakers argued
that was not enough for the bank to backtrack on policy
normalisation. 
    ""A gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation is
justified,"" Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said in
Indonesia on Thursday. ""The current strength of the euro area
economy supports our confidence that inflation will converge
towards ... the ECB's price stability target."" 
    But some policymakers appear to be increasingly cautions,
according to the minutes.
    ""A remark was made that some of the factors behind the
(downward growth) revisions might not be entirely of a
transitory nature,"" the minutes showed. ""It was also argued that
there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to
domestic demand."" 
    Still, while some policymakers argued that the case could be
made for downgrading the risk assessment, there was agreement
that the underlying strength of the economy would mitigate the
downside risks to activity.
    ""High-frequency indicators had stabilised and remained at
elevated levels, underlining the overall robustness of economic
activity,"" chief economist Peter Praet told policymakers at the
meeting, the minutes showed.
    With years of unprecedented stimulus finally lifting
inflation, the ECB has been dialling back support, but only by
the smallest of increments, fearing that bigger moves risked
unravelling its work. 
    While the ECB has not explicitly pledged any rate hikes,
policymakers, including Praet, have argued that they were
comfortable with market expectation for a small increase in the
fourth quarter of 2019, followed by only small and infrequent
moves [nL8N1WB23P].
    ""To be any more precise than that, to lock in a date, to tie
our hands, would be rather risky,"" Ardo Hansson, Estonia's
central bank chief said at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund on Thursday.
    ""When we get closer, we can have another discussion if we
need to adjust the language again, but this is not a debate we
are going to have just yet,"" Hansson said.    
    Policymakers also concluded last month that domestic cost
pressures continued to build and broaden, indicating that
inflation would rise, moving back towards the bank's target of
almost 2 percent after undershooting it for over five
years.[nL2N1WP03N].

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A looming banking
headache could put Italy’s radical government on the spot.
Worsening investor sentiment caused by the Rome’s planned fiscal
binge and its defiant stance vis-à-vis EU partners is hurting
the country’s banks. The weakest ones, like mid-sized Carige,
need capital, but may struggle to raise it. Failure or a bank
rescue would both be politically toxic.
    Loss-making Carige <CRGI.MI>, Italy’s tenth-largest bank by
assets, was struggling long before Fitch Ratings’ warning on
Thursday that it might fail. A restructuring plan launched in
2017 stalled because of persistent shareholder squabbling.
Shareholders who stumped up more than 500 million euros of fresh
equity in December have seen half of it wiped out. The bank
needs 200 million euros or so to meet its capital requirements,
and probably another 300 million euros to cover for losses
linked to a bad debt clean up.
    An already bad situation has been made much worse by the
policies of the current government, a coalition of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League party.
With government bond yields surging, issuing hybrid bonds, as
the bank has promised to do, would command an interest rate well
above 10 percent, bankers say, hurting Carige’s already weak
margins. A takeover by another bank is also unlikely while other
lenders struggle with falling government bond prices. Some may
need to raise capital themselves.
    Carige is also vulnerable from a liquidity perspective. The
group relies mostly on its deposit base for funding. Fitch
Ratings worries that it could be vulnerable to outflows. That,
or failure to plug the capital gap could put it at risk of
resolution. Another crisis would be a difficult scenario for the
current executive. It has been critical of bankers and attacked
the previous government for its handling of past rescues, such
as Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>.
    Letting Carige fail, as Europe’s ‘bail-in’ rules require,
would shield taxpayers from any cost, but could hurt retail
creditors in Genoa, the birthplace of the 5-Star Movement.
Offering state-support, or nationalising the bank, would push up
Italy’s budget deficit and anger other voters. It might still be
the government’s preferred option. That would trigger an even
bigger clash with the European Union.

    He also predicted public debt would fall to 66.6 percent of

    Slovenia, which narrowly avoided an international bailout

    Bertoncelj said last month he planned to reduce debt by 2021

Greek banks dropped in September compared to the previous month,
Bank of Greece data showed on Thursday.
    Emergency funding, which is more costly than borrowing from
the European Central Bank, dropped to 3.58 billion euros ($4.14
billion) from 4.49 billion euros at the of August, the data
showed.
    Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) drawn from the central bank since February 2015 after
being cut off from the ECB's funding window due to stalled
bailout talks between the government and its official creditors.
    Their dependence on the ELA emergency lifeline declined
sharply since June 2016 when the European Central Bank
reinstated banks' access to its cheap funding operations.
    But with Athens out of its bailout program since August 21,
the ECB has ended the waiver that made Greek government bonds
eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

    * EU's Moscovici says not looking for confrontation
    * Moscovici says markets watching Italy closely

    By Jan Strupczewski
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Italy's fiscal
policy must lead to debt reduction because policies that raise
debt are not good for the Italian people, European Commissioner
for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici said before Italy sends
its draft budget for scrutiny in Brussels.
    Italy's populist government is to present to the European
Commission on Monday its draft budget for 2019, which assumes a
deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, three times as
much as foreseen by the previous government.
    This means a higher structural deficit -- which excludes
one-offs and business cycle swings -- which in turn means higher
public debt in a country which already has a debt-to-GDP ratio
of 133 percent, the second highest in Europe after Greece.
    ""I understand that the Italian government wants to implement
programmes to fight poverty, for social inclusion or for
investment. But this is perfectly compatible with serious public
finances and is a matter of political choice,"" Moscovici told
Reuters in an interview.
    ""If debt rises, in the end, who pays? The Italian citizens.
So a budget that would increase public debt would be a budget
against Italian people,"" he said on the sidelines of the
International Monetary Fund's annual meetings in Indonesia. 
    The draft Italian budget also raised concern on financial
markets. Italian three-year bond yields rose to five year highs
at an auction on Thursday and benchmark 10-year paper traded at
4-1/2-year highs. 
    Many officials are privately concerned about the possibility
of Italy sparking another sovereign debt crisis like the one
triggered by Greece in 2010 that nearly destroyed the euro zone.
Italy's economy is almost 10 times bigger than Greece's.
    ""We don't want a crisis, neither a political crisis nor a
financial crisis. With a minimum of goodwill we can avoid bad
scenarios,"" Moscovici said.
    But the Italian government reiterated on Thursday it would
not backtrack on its 2019 budget plan regardless of mounting
market concern over its financial sustainability.
    ""We will not take a step back. We'll invest in jobs and
economic growth,"" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said.
    Moscovici struck a more conciliatory tone.
    ""I do not want us to be in a confrontational mood, because
it leads us nowhere. Rome vs Brussels is absurd, because Italy
is so close to the heart of Europe,"" he said.
    
    'RULES MUST BE MET'
    Moscovici said he would travel to Rome next Thursday and
Friday to discuss the budget with Finance Minister Giovanni Tria
and other officials to find a solution. The commission's focus
is on Italy's structural deficit, which under the rules should
fall by 0.6 percent of GDP next year, but under the current plan
is to rise by 0.8 percent of GDP.
    ""It is clear that there might be a gap at the end of the
dialogue, but we need to reduce that gap,"" Moscovici said.
    ""We have shown a lot of flexibility to Italy and I am not
talking about that anymore. Rules have to be met. You talked
about markets -- everybody will be watchful about the direction
of the movements -- whether they tend to increase the deficit or
decrease it,"" he said.
    The draft Italian budget assumes economic growth of 1.5
percent, that is to accelerate to 1.6 percent in 2020 and slow
slightly to 1.4 percent in 2021. These forecasts are seen as
optimistic by euro zone officials and by the Italian Fiscal
Board, an independent body set up to check budget assumptions.
    ""Of course the forecast on public finances is linked to the
forecast on growth,"" Moscovici said.
    If Italy's deficit targets do not change the Commission has
the right to reject the draft budget and demand a new one -- a
move it has never resorted to so far.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British banks could face
potential credit rating downgrades if there is a disorderly
Brexit as this would be likely to trigger a domestic political
crisis and economic contraction, credit rating agency Standard &
Poor's said on Thursday.
    S&P said that UK banks' earnings and balance sheets would
provide a solid cushion against a disorderly Brexit. But the
agency also said: ""Their current ratings and/or outlooks may not
prove to be consistent with a disruptive Brexit accompanied by a
severe economic shock.""
    Britain and the European Union are aiming to reach agreement
on a divorce settlement in time for an EU summit next week.
    S&P said that while it expects an orderly departure in March
followed by a transition period to the end of 2020, some
financial institutions have reached a point of no return and are
setting up new hubs in the EU to avoid disruption.
    Even with an orderly Brexit, there would be pressure on
banks to shift euro-denominated clearing of transactions, such
as derivatives, from London-listed LCH <LSE.L> to the EU, S&P
said.
    Fitch Ratings, a rival ratings agency, said that UK banks
are well funded to face a no-deal Brexit, but could face
challenges if wholesale markets were disrupted for a lengthy
period.
    ""Their ratings should be able to withstand economic
deterioration in the no-deal scenarios,"" Fitch said in a
statement. 
    
    EURO CLEARING
    S&P reiterated warnings from the Bank of England on Tuesday
that derivatives markets face disruption from a no-deal Brexit
unless the EU allows EU customers to continue using LCH, part of
the London Stock Exchange, that clears the bulk of euro
denominated swaps. [nL8N1WP2EO]
    Some euro clearing of these transactions has already moved
to rival central counterparty (CCP) Eurex <DB1Gn.DE> in
Frankfurt.
    The EU is in the process of introducing a law that would
require LCH to be supervised by the bloc's regulators as well as
the Bank of England if it wants to continue serving EU
customers.
    ""While dual supervision could yet be a negotiated middle
ground for one or more U.K. CCPs, it appears challenging to
apply effectively in practice, not least when clear and rapid
decision making is required in a crisis,"" S&P said.
    Clearing houses such as LCH act as a financial backstop if
transactions they handle run into trouble.
    Pressure to shift euro clearing would moderately affect LCH,
S&P said.
    ""Our base-case view is that LCH Ltd will maintain its market
leading franchise in OTC interest rate swaps following Brexit,
and an (ratings) upgrade would depend on us becoming
increasingly confident in this outcome,"" the agency said.
    Fitch said there would be significant negative consequences
for banks and financial stability if no interim solution was in
place for derivatives ahead of a no-deal Brexit.

Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget could escalate in the coming days if the EU Commission
decided to trigger a procedure to reject the Italian budgetary
plans.
    The unprecedented move would formally begin a long legal
dispute that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy
until it is resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but has so far not been applied to any member
of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the possible
procedure and of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Oct. 15: This is the deadline for euro zone states to submit
to the EU Commission their draft budgets for the following year.
     
    Oct. 22: After the submission of draft plans, the Commission
has one week to identify ""particularly serious non-compliance
with the budgetary policy obligations"" of a state. Assuming
Italy submits its draft budget on Oct. 15, as is common
practice, the Commission will have until Oct. 22 to make its
concerns known to Italy.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to a run a structural surplus of 0.6
percent of its Gross Domestic Product in 2019, but the
government's new plans foresee instead a structural deficit of
0.8 percent of GDP. The structural balance excludes one-off
expenditures, for emergencies or natural catastrophes.  
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of 130 percent of GDP, which should instead fall,
under EU rules.
    
   Oct. 29: If the Commission decided to consider Italy's draft
budget non-compliant with EU rules, it has to reject it within
two weeks of submission. This deadline would expire on Oct. 29
if Italy submits its budget on Oct 15. Brussels would have to
explain in a written opinion its reasons for sending the budget
back to Rome for changes. 
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
regular monthly meeting which would put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 19: In the event its budget were rejected by the
Commission, the Italian government would have three weeks from
the date of the EU opinion to submit a revised budget. This
deadline would expire on Nov. 19 if the Commission's opinion was
adopted on Oct. 29.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 10: The Commission would have three weeks, likely until
Dec. 10, from the submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt
a new opinion in which it would describe Italy's overall
budgetary position and its impact on the whole euro zone.
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission is expected
to publish its economic forecasts up to 2020, which would show
whether EU calculations match Italy's growth, debt and deficit
projections which underpin budget targets. The data could pave
the way to sanction procedures if EU and Italian data differed
widely.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines. 
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just few
weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

figure includes inward and outward payments)
    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled cross-border transactions
of more than $1 trillion in and out of the country between 2008
and 2017, according to its central bank.
    The European Union member country of just 1.3 million people
has been rocked by revelations that banks there laundered money
from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank
accounts. The scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and 
neighbouring Latvia to shut down.
    The data on cross-border transactions, first reported by
Bloomberg, suggests that the scale of the money laundering
through the small Baltic country may have been larger then
previously thought. The news sent Nordic banking shares sharply
lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all payments, including resident
and non-resident transactions, a spokesman said.
    Estonia's entire economic output came to about $25 billion
last year - roughly the same as that of Uganda or Nepal -
suggesting that much of the money flow was not directly linked
to economic activity in the country.
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the payments suspicious. 
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    The central bank later said the figure in the Bloomberg
report doesn't relate specifically to non-resident transactions
but to all payments in and out of the country, including imports
and exports and routine financial transactions such as
securities purchases. 
    Estonia's imports and exports totalled 232 billion euros
between 2008 and 2017, official data showed. 
    The central bank said in a statement that non-resident flows
""only make up one part of the sum,"" adding that it does not
collect separate data for those transactions.
    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Copenhagen-based expert
on money laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates
that the Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the
problem related to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 3.3 percent and 5.8 percent
lower, respectively. The region's biggest bank Nordea was
trading 2.9 percent lower, while Danske Bank, whose shares have
lost one-third of their value since March, was down 1.5 percent.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,
according to its website. 
    Its Nordic rival SEB <SEBa.ST> also has major operations in
the Baltics after acquisitions in the late 1990s. It had 920,000
private and 99,000 corporate customers according to its 2017
annual report. 
    ""We have very few if any customers that are not based in the
Baltic countries,"" an SEB spokesman said. ""We feel satisfied
that our process concerning these issues works.""
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
    That compares to outgoing payments of $500 billion from
Estonia between 2008 and 2015, according to central bank data.  
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

    By Francesco Canepa
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank won't come to Italy's rescue if its governments or bank
sector run out of cash unless the country secures a bailout from
the European Union, five senior sources familiar with the ECB's
thinking told Reuters.
    Italy has seen its borrowing costs surge on financial
markets since its new government unveiled plans to increase its
budget deficit late last month, defying EU rules and reawakening
concerns about its huge pile of public debt.
    The sources, present an economic summit in Indonesia, said
Italy could still avoid a debt crisis if its government changed
course but should not count on the central bank to tame
investors or prop up its banks. 
    This is because EU rules do not allow the ECB to help a
country unless this has already agreed on a rescue ""programme"" -
political jargon for a bailout in exchange for belt-tightening
and painful economic reforms, an option the Italian government
has firmly rejected.
    Any attempt to circumvent those rules would damage the ECB's
credibility beyond repair and undermine acceptance of the
monetary union in creditor countries, such as Germany, the
sources said. 
    ""It’s a test-case to show Europe and its mechanisms work,""
said one of the sources on the sidelines of the International
Monetary Fund's annual meetings in the Indonesian resort town of
Nusa Dua.
    If Italy did secure a bailout, the ECB could then buy its
bonds on the market via Outright Monetary Transactions, a so far
unused policy tool unveiled in 2012 to quash speculation on a
euro break-up.
    An ECB spokesman declined to comment. 
    
    FLASHPOINT
    The sources warned that Italian banks, with 375 billion
euros ($435 billion) of domestic government debt on their
balance sheet, were the possible flashpoint.
    This is because they relied on those government bonds as
collateral to secure cash at the ECB, including some 250 billion
euros worth of long-term loans.
     If Italy, like Greece, were to lose its investment-grade
rating, the bonds that the banks used would become ineligible
for regular ECB lending, as well as for the ECB's bond-buying
stimulus programme.
    Banks that don't have alternative collateral of good quality
would then need to apply for a lifeline known as Emergency
Liquidity Assistance, supplied by the Bank of Italy.
    ""There are some banks that are actually in pretty good shape
so it wouldn’t be all of them (requesting ELA),"" another source
said.
    But even ELA could run into constraints after a while if
reliance on grew too high.
    As ELA can only be granted to solvent banks, the ECB's
Governing Council could require that an economic programme is in
place in Italy before it gives its all-clear to large amounts of
ECB cash being disbursed, much like it did in Greece.
    The ECB froze the amount of ELA available to Greek banks in
the summer of 2015 when Alexis Tsipras' leftist government
refused to agree to a bailout, leaving him with little choice
but to close the banks.
    ""We wouldn't want to give out cash to the banks only for it
to be taken abroad,"" a third source said. 
    Before that even happens, depositors and lenders would have
likely cut ties with Italian banks in anticipation of the
downgrade, triggering a liquidity crisis, the sources said.
    Italy's debt is rated two notches above junk by three of the
four ratings agencies recognised by the ECB, and three notches
above that key threshold by the remaining one, DBRS.
    Moody’s and S&P Global are due to provide an updated opinion
on Italy’s credit rating in the second half of October, with
analysts saying that around one downgrade is already priced in.

raised its economic growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 on
stronger than expected domestic demand, but warned that even an
orderly Brexit would significantly dent growth over the next
several years. 
    In a quarterly report on the health of the economy, the
central bank estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) would
expand by 6.7 percent this year and 4.8 percent next year, up
from forecasts in July of 4.7 and 4.2 percent respectively.
    The Irish government last week forecast GDP growth of 7.5
percent in 2018 and 4.2 percent in 2019. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    Ireland has posted the fastest economic growth in the
European Union every year since 2014 but the relevance of using
the GDP benchmark has been put into doubt by foreign investment
flows skewing the figure.
    The central bank said underlying domestic demand, a measure
that strips out the impact of investment flows by Ireland's
large multinational sector, would grow 5.6 percent this year and
4.2 percent next year. 
    ""The underlying picture suggests that the growth of domestic
economic activity gathered pace in the first half of 2018,"" the
report said. ""Supported by strong and sustained employment
growth and improving household balance sheets, growth in
consumer spending has gained momentum.""
    Growth is also being boosted by construction, with
housebuilding growing by around 25 percent per year as the
country struggles to make up for several years of minimal
construction in the aftermath of the country's economic crisis,
the bank said.  
    The bank also published new estimates of the impact of
Brexit on Ireland. If Brexit leaves World Trade Organisation
rules governing trade between Britain and Ireland, Ireland's GDP
will be 2.9 percent lower in the long run. 
    If the Brexit proposal favoured by British Prime Minister
Theresa May - the so-called Chequers option - Irish GDP would be
1.7 percent smaller than if Britain remained in the EU's single
market and customs union, it said.

are arriving in Indonesian resort of Bali this week for the

    The gathering comes amid an escalating trade dispute between

a ""normalisation"" from previous years' exuberance, rather than a
consequence of trade tensions.
    Turning to Italy, Scholz said he took Italian policymakers'
pledge to respect EU budget rules ""at face value"" but sent a
warning to the euro zone's largest debtor.
    ""If anybody has to give advice to Italy it's to be careful
what it's doing,"" he said.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Sujata Rao. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has a
blunt message for Italy's leaders: Don't expect us to shield you
or your banks from financial market displeasure at your spending
plans. Sources at the ECB point to European Union rules that
state that cannot help a country unless it has already agreed on
an EU bailout in exchange for belt-tightening and painful
economic reforms - an option Rome has firmly rejected. This
message is in line with the one coming from Brussels sources,
which previously indicated to Reuters that it does not consider
Italy ""too big to save"" - in other words, the EU believes the
eurozone now has the structures in place both to limit any
contagion from Italy and then to clean up the mess afterwards.
As one source familiar with the ECB's thinking said: ""It’s a
test-case to show Europe and its mechanisms work.""
    The general noise coming out of British PM Theresa May's
cabinet meeting last night suggests that she gave ministers the
distinct impression a Brexit deal was imminent. That has in
turned prompted speculation that those ministers on the
hard-Brexit end of the spectrum are equally close to quitting,
given their fears that May's deal will bind the UK into
perennial vassalage; DUP officials are meanwhile talking darkly
of betrayal. In other words, it's all business as usual ahead of
next week's summit and probably only a foretaste of the
grandstanding to come over the next few weeks. Envoys from the
other 27 EU member states meet in Luxembourg to discuss the
state of play today.
    The big election over the weekend is in Bavaria, where the
incumbent conservative CSU party faces a major challenge from
the upstart AfD far-right movement. Polls show the CSU will win
at most 35 percent on Sunday, losing the absolute majority with
which it has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of
the post-war period. One possible outcome is that the socially
conservative party is forced into an alliance with the left-wing
Greens - odd bedfellows indeed. The election also has
consequences for national politics: the CSU are Merkel's
longstanding allies in Berlin, so anything that weakens them in
turn could make her coalition even more fragile. 
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
Is this it for the stock market bulls? Maybe not. After Wall
Street's SP500 fell another 2 percent last night -- weaker-than-
expected inflation numbers failed to staunch the bleeding -- 
futures are pointing to a strong rebound today. Asia’s MSCI
ex-Japan index has bounced 2 percent and Europe is set for a
firmer opening, too. But two big loss-making sessions have left
the S&P500 looking at its third straight week of losses –- the
longest weekly stretch in the red since June 2016.  It’s also
left investors scratching their heads for the reasons – is it
machine-based trading?  Trade tensions? The Fed? One theory has
been that equity markets, especially tech shares, have been
carried higher by momentum, above where they should reasonably
be -- the question is whether the same will apply on the way
down. But maybe that downturn has been deferred for the time
being. U.S. banks today kick off the third-quarter earnings
season, a crucial test for markets. Expectations are the quarter
as a whole will deliver 20 percent-plus earnings growth, which
should be a source of encouragement for equity investors.
    But fears may centre around China, where Shanghai stocks,
despite today’s 1 percent bounce, are set for almost a 10
percent fall this week. And the yuan is biting the dust again
today, down a quarter percent to the dollar to a near four-year
low on nervousness that a U.S. Treasury Department report due
next week will label Beijing a currency manipulator. What’s
more, latest Chinese trade figures may stoke President Donald
Trump’s ire. There’s no sign so far of trade wars denting
Chinese exports -- its trade surplus with the United States hit
a record high in September. However, the trade data may have
helped Shanghai stocks rebound 1 percent. 
    On the currency front, the dollar touched a fresh two-week
low against a currency basket, reeling from the equity selloff,
the weaker inflation data and Trump’s fresh criticism of the
Fed, whose rate rise he called ""ridiculous"".  But the dollar’s
weakness has provided some relief to emerging currencies, with
an index up almost half a percent and others, such as the Indian
rupee, rebounding from record lows. The other emerging-market
weak link -- the Turkish lira -- now seems firmly above 6 per
dollar, approaching two-month highs on hopes that a trial of a
U.S. evangelical pastor will result in his release. Sterling and
euro are motionless this morning, though the former is near
three-week highs, coiled like a spring for any sign of more
Brexit news. 
    European shares  were set to benefit from Asia’s rebound,
with futures extending gains up 0.7 to 1.2 percent across the
main euro zone and UK benchmarks. If the bounce is sustained,
the euro zone STOXX could make up some of this week’s heavy
losses, which have left it on track for its worst week since the
February selloff. Positive comments from the IMF could help
confirm Europe’s rebound: the head of the IMF’s European unit
said the direct impact of potential U.S. car tariffs on Europe
would be relatively limited, though they could still affect
investor sentiment. Big European brewers ABInBev and Carlsberg
could move after a source-based Reuters report that India’s
antitrust watchdog raided their offices in at least two Indian
cities as part of an investigation of alleged price-fixing.  
    In the UK, results from more asset managers are likely to
move shares after Jupiter and Hargreaves Lansdowne disappointed
on Thursday. Both Man Group’s and Ashmore’s funds under
management rose thanks to market gains and net inflows.
    Other stock movers: Sports Direct buys Glasgow department
store Frasers for 95 million pounds; Atalaya Mining to explore
strategic options; Lockheed, Rheinmetall to make joint bid to
supply German navy helicopters; Italy's Carige to look at naming
investment bank for tie-ups; Italy could have around 15 percent
of new Alitalia; Italian railways on board; Virgin's Branson
halts talks on $1 billion Saudi investment in space ventures;
Shell seeks to sell Venezuela venture stake to France's Maurel &
Prom; Hurricane Michael cuts U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output 40
percent; Tencent Music delays $2 billion U.S. IPO; India to
raise import tariffs on electronic and communication items;
Vonovia buys stake in residential portfolio from SNCF; Brexit
negotiators eye Monday breakthrough -- Northern Irish party ups
the ante.
    Emerging-market stocks rose almost 2 percent, snapping a
six-day losing streak that culminated in the biggest daily fall
since the Brexit vote market turmoil in June 2016. Asian shares
rebounded; Hong Kong, Taiwan and India jumped 2 percent and
China mainland shares gained 1 to 1.5 percent. However, the
latter are on track for their worst week since the emerging=
market rout in early February, while the broader MSCI’s EM index
is on track for a 2.8 percent fall over the week – its third
straight week in the red.
    Emerging-market currencies also chalked up healthy gains.
Turkey’s lira rose nearly 1 percent against the dollar,
extending a 2.5 percent gain the previous day, on expectations
that the standoff between Washington and Ankara over the U.S.
evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson could be resolved soon with
another court hearing in the case set for Friday. The currency
looks on track for a gain of around 4 percent for the week, its
best such advance since mid-August. South Africa’s rand sailed
0.8 percent higher ahead of a Moody’s ratings decision, though
markets widely expect the ratings agency to keep as is and await
the mid-term budget to be delivered by new Finance Minister Tito
Mboweni on Oct. 26.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro zone's
continuing expansion has vindicated European Central Bank policy
but risks to the outlook, from trade protectionism to the threat
of a hard Brexit, are on the rise, ECB President Mario Draghi
said on Friday.
    The ECB has been dialling back stimulus for months and
expects to end a 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase scheme in
December, arguing that it has done enough to sustain growth and
the rebound in inflation.
    But Draghi also toned down earlier remarks, which
foreshadowed a ""relatively vigorous"" rise in underlying
inflation, merely predicting a ""gradual"" increase over the
medium term. 
    ""Recent developments vindicate the Governing Council’s
earlier assessments of the medium-term inflation outlook,""
Draghi said at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting.
""Uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding.""
    In a potential reference to the rise in Italian yields,
Draghi also played down concerns about recent market volatility,
suggesting that this has not had a broader impact.
    ""With respect to financial stability more broadly, recent
episodes of heightened financial market volatility have led to
only limited contagion across countries and markets,"" Draghi
told the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee in
Bali.
    Still, he warned of increasingly prominent external risks,
which would impact euro zone growth.
    ""An orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the
European Union poses a limited overall risk to the euro area’s
financial stability,"" Draghi said.
    ""However, the uncertainty triggered by a cliff-edge Brexit
could have the potential to pose a more significant downside
risk to financial stability,"" he added.

responsibility and others making the case that it should focus
on inflation only and leave stability to political authorities.
    Lautenschlaeger warned that the ECB's own bond purchases,

reducing liquidity and distorting asset prices while its low
rates could fuel asset price bubbles.

    By Jan Strupczewski and Francesco Canepa
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Italy must respect
European Union budget rules with its 2019 budget and improve
public finances if it wants to create headroom to loosen fiscal
policy during the next economic downturn, a top International
Monetary Fund official said.
    Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF's European department,
told a news conference on Friday that Rome was wrong to target
an increase in its headline and structural budget deficit next
year in breach of EU budget rules.
    ""We still project relatively strong growth in Italy next
year. This is not the time to relax fiscal policy, this is the
time to have some fiscal structural adjustment,"" Thomsen said at
the IMF's annual meeting on the Indonesian resort island of
Bali.
    The populist government in Rome plans a headline gap of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's 
target. EU officials estimate this would translate in to a rise
in the structural deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP, while EU rules
ask for a 0.6 percent cut, rather than an increase.
    ""A fiscal relaxation of that magnitude... is not correct.
The market reaction has been quite unfavourable and that
illustrates the point about fiscal space,"" Thomsen said.
     Investors have been selling Italian bonds in reaction to
the higher borrowing plan with yields of the three year paper
hitting 5-year highs at an auction on Thursday and 10-year
benchmark paper trading at 4.5 year highs <IT10YT=TWEB>.
    The European Commission, which is the guardian of EU rules,
and euro zone finance ministers have said the planned deficit
most likely meant a rise in Italy's public debt which is already
the second biggest in Europe at 133 percent of GDP.
    Italy's Economy Minister Giovanni Tria raised many eyebrows
earlier this month at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers
when he said in an ad-hoc presentation of the draft that despite
the deficit increase, debt would fall.
    EU officials at the Bali meeting said this would only be
possible if economic growth generated by the higher deficit was
very high.
    But the 1.4 percent economic growth forecast by the Italian
government for next year and 1.5 seen in 2020 has already been
declared as too optimistic by the Italian Fiscal Board - an
independent body set up to check budget assumptions.
    EU officials also note that higher borrowing costs for
Italy, triggered by the announcement of the higher deficit plans
already offset much of the expected higher growth. 
    ""If anybody has to give advice to Italy it's to be careful
what it's doing,"" Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz said in
Bali on Friday.
    Tria reaffirmed his ""intention to maintain a constructive
dialogue with the EU Commission and the other euro area
partners"" on Friday after meeting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin in the resort island.

    By Paul Carrel and Alexander Hübner
    BERLIN/MUNICH, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Munich-based German
aircraft engine maker MTU Aero Engines <MTXGn.DE> has warned its
employees against populism before a regional election in
Bavaria, and consultants EY have issued their local staff with
similar guidance.
    Though neither company mentioned the anti-immigration
Alternative for Germany (AfD) in their internal memoranda, the
messages highlight corporate concerns about the rise of the
far-right and perceived threats to German political stability.
    The AfD, which has campaigned in Bavaria with the slogan
""our state, our homeland"", is poised to surge into the regional
assembly in Bavaria for the first time after Sunday's vote.
    MTU told employees in a letter: ""Populist slogans don't take
our country forward, but rather targeted government action on
the basis of our core values.""
    ""Germany, and especially a strategically-orientated industry
like ours, relies on stable political conditions,"" MTU directors
added in the letter, which was posted on the company's intranet
and a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
    The directors stressed they were not advising their
employees which party to back, but urged them to vote
""responsibly"". Around half of MTU's 10,000 workers are based in
Bavaria.
    The AfD has established itself across Germany with
anti-Islamic rhetoric and attacks on Chancellor Angela Merkel's
migrant policy. This is a particularly hot topic in Bavaria,
where most of the 1.5 million asylum seekers who have reached
Germany in the past three years entered the country.
    The AfD's rise has eroded support for Merkel's allies in
Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU), who are set to lose
the absolute majority with which they have controlled the
southern state for most of the post-war period.
    In Bavaria, support for the AfD - with whom the CSU has
ruled out an alliance - stands at 10-14 percent, surveys show.
    After the Bavarian vote, the AfD is set to have seats in 15
of Germany's 16 state assemblies and it is likely to enter the
remaining one, Hesse, after a state election there on Oct. 28.
    In an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by
Reuters, EY's Munich-based managing director in Germany, Hubert
Barth, wrote: ""Today, our liberal democracy is once again
exposed to major attacks at home and from abroad.""
    Referring to the ""landmark"" elections in Bavaria and Hesse -
home to the financial centre of Frankfurt - Barth added: ""Our
democracy is an important part of our economic success.""
    ""I call on all colleagues to exercise their right to vote in
order to strengthen the democratic and constitutional forces in
our country,"" Barth concluded in his email, which was headed ""a
political statement"".
    The expected setback for the CSU risks widening divisions
within Germany's crisis-prone national government, which depends
on support from the Bavarian party.

officials worry that Italy's 2.4 percent of GDP budget gap for
2019, already seen as too high, could turn out to be even
higher, as deficit boosting measures in the draft budget have
not been well detailed and growth could be lower.
    Italy's populist government is to submit its 2019 draft
budget plan to Brussels on Monday for checks if it is in line
with EU rules -- the Stability and Growth Pact. The European
Commission has already said it is likely to break the rules.
    ""We don't know if the deficit will end up at 2.4 next year,
or maybe more. The measures are not specified in enough detail
to establish that and the gap may turn out bigger in the end
also because growth may be slower,"" one senior EU official said.
    Another senior EU official, also attending annual IMF and
World Bank meetings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali,
gave the same assessment of the prospects for Italy's budget
deficit.
    The EU vetting comes amid market concern over Italy's
borrowing plans, which triple the size of the gap planned by the
previous Italian administration, putting further strain on the
country's already bloated public finances where the debt to GDP
ratio is the second highest in Europe at 133 percent.
    Investors have been selling Italian paper since the deficit
plans were announced in late September and yields of 10-year
benchmark paper <IT10YT=TWEB> have risen to 4-1/2 year highs
above 3.5 percent.

survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Friday, defeating
critics who blame the government for growing costs and waiting
lists in a sector the IMF says needs more curbs on spending.
    Four opposition parties accuse the minister, Milan
Kujundzic, of failing to tackle long waiting lists and a problem
of medical staff leaving for better working conditions and
higher salaries in other European Union countries. [nL8N1WE3FH]
    In the 151-seat parliament, only 53 deputies out of the 130
present during the vote supported Kujundzic's removal.

    ""Demands for his resignation are unfounded. Kujundzic is

over years."" 
    Croatia's health sector, together with pension system costs,
present the biggest burden on state coffers.
    The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
many analysts have warned Croatia for years that its health
system is not sustainable without strong improvement in spending
control and reduction of some capacities, including merging of
hospitals in some areas.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Brussels, the political heart
of Europe, could prove the centre of global market focus next
week as Italy's budget and Brexit talks overshadow economic data
and central banks.
    World shares were on course for their worst week since
February as a spike in U.S. bond yields, a U.S.-China trade war
and other global risks have combined to undermine sentiment.
    One such risk is an impending dispute between Italy's
eurosceptic government and the European Union over Rome's 2019
budget plans, which could lead the EU executive to the
unprecedented move of rejecting it.
    Euro zone countries, including Italy, have until Monday to
submit their draft budgetary plans to the European Commission,
winch which would have to warn Rome within a week if it planned
to trigger the rejection process. [nL8N1WR2UJ]
    The populist Italian government plans a deficit of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's
target, prompting investors to sell Italian bonds and pushing
the country's borrowing costs to five-year high at a bond
auction. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    EU leaders meeting in Brussels from Wednesday to Friday are
expected to spend time discussing Italy, even if it is not
formally on the agenda of an exceptional three days of talks
that will also see them meeting around 25 Asian leaders,
including the prime ministers of China and Japan.
    That agenda does include efforts to finalise a withdrawal
deal with Britain.
    Finding a way of ensuring an open border between Ireland and
Northern Ireland post-Brexit has been the main challenge, but
the indications in the past two weeks are that both sides are
inching towards a deal, boosting the pound.
    ""Now comes the crunch time,"" said economists at Commerzbank,
adding that there was the risk of a sharp correction if
negotiations drag on beyond the coming week.
    James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said
Italy's budget and Brexit would be in sharp focus in the week
ahead, along with the course of markets themselves.
    ""Are we going to get any calm returning to equity markets?
There's a lot of unsettling concern about the combination of
higher bond yields, geopolitical risk and the ongoing trade
tensions,"" he said.
    
    FED ON TRACK DESPITE TRUMP INVECTIVE
    In terms of data, September retail sales from the United
States are expected to reflect the strength of the world's
largest economy with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, a
49-year low, and wages picking up.
    The sales figures on Monay are seen up 0.5 percent in after
a mere 0.1 percent increase in August, the smallest rise in six
months.
    Such data should confirm the Federal Reserve in its
rate-cutting path, even if U.S. President Donald Trump has
called it crazy. The Fed increased interest rates for a third
time this year at the end of September and is expected to do so
again.
    ""That's going to be keeping the Fed on a rates-hiking and
tightening path, even though there is some concern in financial
markets right now,"" said Knightley.
    The week is set to round off with figures on Chinese
economic growth on Friday. The average forecast for expansion in
the third quarter is 6.6 percent, a shade lower than the 6.7
percent growth in the April-June period. 
    Anything lower than that could indicate that the trade war
with Washington, as well as a slowing property market, could be
dragging down the world's second-largest economy.
    Trade figures from China on Friday showed China's trade
surplus with the United States hit a record high in September.
    The data showed solid expansion in China's overall imports
and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat
tariffs with the United States, though that could provoke a
reaction from Trump. [nL4N1WP28H]

 Reuters Hungary GDP forecasts

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank (NBH) is
expected to keep Central Europe's lowest interest rates on hold
at its meeting on Oct. 16 and for the rest of 2018, not worried
by a rise in inflation, a survey of analysts showed.
    In the Oct. 8-11 poll, 16 analysts unanimously forecast that
the bank would keep its record-low 0.9 percent base rate
unchanged on Tuesday.
    None of the participants projected a change in the -0.15
percent overnight deposit rate, either, and all of the forecasts
were for no change in either rate this year.
    The bank revamped its policy tools last month to prepare for
policy normalisation if inflation trends justify. But it stopped
short of hinting at an upcoming change in monetary conditions
[nL8N1W459U].
    Annual headline inflation picked up to 3.6 percent in
September from 3.4 percent in August [nB3N1TG02O].
    That is the highest rate since January 2013, but still
within the NBH's 2 to 4 percent target range, and core inflation
excluding volatile food and energy items remained lower, at 2.4
percent.
    In an article published after the September figures, NBH
economists Pal Kolozsi and Mihaly Hoffmann said inflation trends
did not justify changing the direction of monetary policy
[nL8N1WP28M].
    Analysts have said inflation could stay above 3 percent in
the next months. Hungary's real interest rate, the premium over
inflation, is the lowest in the region.
    In the poll, annual average inflation is forecast at 2.9
percent for this year, 3.3 percent for next year and 3.1 percent
in 2020.
    Even though those figures are within the target range, NBH
rate setters also need to watch the central bankers in the
United States, the euro zone and the region.
    A rise in interest rates elsewhere can weaken the forint if
Hungarian interest rates stay low, which can generate additional
inflation and in turn more forint weakness. 
    Fears of that vicious circle was demonstrated by a plunge of
the currency to record lows against the euro three months ago as
a rally of the dollar caused currency selling in emerging
markets, while inflation worry added to pressure on the forint.
    ""The timing of the start of rate tightening will hinge on
the forint,"" said Gergely Szabo Forian, Chief Investment Officer
at Amundi's Budapest-based unit. 
    In Central Europe, the Czech and the Romanian central banks
have already followed the Federal Reserve's example and raised
rates.    
    The poll showed that the NBH is expected to join the pack
around the time when the European Central Bank is seen starting
to normalise its own interest rates in the autumn of next year.
    The bank is expected to allow liquidity in domestic markets
to tighten gradually even before that.
    However, some analysts have warned that the NBH may fall
behind the curve if inflation accelerates faster than currently
expected or a new round of emerging-market sell-offs spills over
into central Europe, driving up risk premiums on local assets.
    ""Short-term interest rates offer a terribly low real
interest and the market considers this unsustainable,"" Szabo
Forian said. The spread between three-month and 10-year
Hungarian yields has widened to at least 14-year highs over the
past months.
    The survey saw the three-month interbank BUBOR rate <BUBOR=>
rising to 0.6 percent over the next one year from Friday's 0.7
percent.
    The overnight deposit rate is expected to rise to zero by
the end of 2019 from -0.15 percent and to 0.5 percent in 2020.
    Some analysts also expect the base rate to start to rise
from 0.9 percent next year, but their median forecasts show an
unchanged rate for the end of 2019, before a rise to 1.5 percent
in 2020.

debt denominated in foreign currencies that it holds to zero,
which would take an overhauled debt-financing strategy, central
bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Friday, according to the
state news agency, MTI.
    The central bank is not in charge of debt-financing policy, 
but Matolcsy, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's former economy
minister, has implemented a string of programmes over the past
years to cut Hungary's exposure to foreign-currency debt.
    The measures have included a conversion of Hungarian
mortgage loans into forints just before the Swiss National Bank
abandoned its cap on the franc <CHFHUF=> in 2015 and cheap
refinancing loans for small businesses to convert their loans.
    Reducing the state foreign-currency debt should be Hungary's
top economic policy priority, MTI quoted Matolcsy as saying at a
business forum, in a summary of his remarks.
    Hungary issued 1 billion euros worth of eurobonds last month
as debt agency AKK tried to build up financing buffers through
the end of the year, while the government is locked in a dispute
with the European Commission over European Union funds.
    At the end of August, the debt denominated in foreign
currency as a proportion of total debt stood at 19.5 percent.
The AKK and the finance ministry could not immediately comment
on Matolcsy's remarks.
    Top central bankers have recently argued in favour of
channelling more household savings from short-term instruments
like bank deposits into government debt and stocks to bolster
the capital market and cut reliance on external funding.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Italy's finance
minister poured cold water on Friday on the idea, promoted by
the ruling League party, of giving tax breaks to Italian
citizens who invest in domestic government debt.
    Members of the far-right League, including party leader and
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, have been pushing for a
scheme of incentives to boost the share of Italy's 2.3 trillion
euro debt held domestically. 
    Discouraged by falling returns, Italians have come to hold
just around 5 percent of Rome's debt pile. 
    The proposal comes at a time when Italy's debt costs are
soaring due to declining demand from foreign investors, who
worry about the government's plans to run higher deficits in
defiance of European Union rules.  
    Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, a technocrat with no party
affiliation, defended Italy's much criticised expansionary
fiscal policy but distanced himself from the proposed scheme of
tax incentives.
    ""I've read about this measure in the papers and it has never

    A source close to the matter told Reuters the Rome Treasury

bonds would run counter to European rules.

International Monetary Fund's annual meetings in Indonesia.
    A source close to the matter told Reuters the Rome Treasury
dislikes the idea because preferential treatment for domestic
bonds would run counter to European rules.
    Traders and analysts say the mooted caps of 15 billion
euros, or 3,000 euros per person per year, mean the measures
would have scant impact in helping Italy refinancing around 400
billion euros of debt a year.
    Tria also gave short shrift to the notion, raised by Italy's
other deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, of Treasury
involvement in the rescue of troubled flagship carrier Alitalia.
Tria said this matter was only for the finance minister to
decide.
    He also argued for speeding up insolvency proceedings to
help banks solve their issues with unpaid loans.
    This has been a mantra for the European Central Bank and
previous Italian administrations, but could ruffle feathers in
the Five Star Movement, the left-leaning senior party in Italy's
ruling populist coalition. 
    Tria looks weak and isolated after he caved in to party
chiefs by agreeing to raise next year's fiscal deficit far above
levels agreed with Brussels. [nL8N1WP2GM]
    An economy ministry source and an institutional source told
Reuters last week that Tria had told aides he planned to resign
after the budget has been approved by parliament at the end of
the year.

1078,2573,f756170b6bae066aac261cb7783329ed,Piraeus Bank in talks with ECB for more time to issue Tier-2 bond - sources,2018-10-12 23:39:01,EUR,0,2018-10-12 23:39:01,{'EUR': 'Negative'},"    By George Georgiopoulos and Balazs Koranyi
    ATHENS/FRANKFURT, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Greece's largest lender
by assets, Piraeus Bank <BOPr.AT>, has told the European Central
Bank that it may miss a year-end target to raise capital because
of unfavourable financial markets, sources familiar with the
matter said.
    The ECB would like Piraeus to raise capital by the end of
this year, a target that the Greek lender has been working
towards, but rising bond yields have frustrated its attempts to
go to the market.
    Greece emerged from its latest bailout in August but its
banks are still fragile as they struggle to reduce their bad
loan pile stemming from the country's sovereign debt crisis. At
88 billion euros ($102 billion), the sector's soured debts
amount to nearly half the country's annual economic output. 
    Greek bank stocks have lost about half their value this
year, and the slide has been intensifying in recent days as a
rout in Italy's government bond market eroded appetite for
riskier euro zone assets. [nL8N1WO2TI]  
    Rising funding costs are in turn frustrating attempts by
weaker European banks to mend their balance sheets, at a time
when the ECB is keen to shore up the financial system against
the risk of another crisis.
    Piraeus has said it is implementing a capital enhancement
plan that will include a subordinate debt issue, a non-dilutive
Tier-2 bond to raise about 500 million euros.
    Earlier this month, Piraeus Chief Executive Christos Megalou
told Reuters the bank was in continuous dialogue with
supervisory authorities and monitoring debt capital markets for
a window of opportunity to issue the bond. [nL8N1WJ1YD]
    Piraeus shares have stabilised after a steep 37 percent fall
since the start of October, sparked in part by concerns over 
the bank's frustrated efforts to issue subordinated debt.
    ""We continue to monitor markets and when conditions are
right we will proceed with a Tier-2 issue,"" a senior source at
the bank told Reuters on Friday.
    The bank is likely to be given some flexibility in terms of
the timing, given the tough market conditions, said another
source at the bank. 
    Piraeus will not be in breach of capital rules if it misses
a Dec. 31 deadline, meaning the ECB will not have to sanction
the bank, this source said. 
    But the miss would be seen as a test of its supervisor's
resolve as the ECB is still testing how to enforce non-binding
expectations.
    The deadline is also seen as crucial as Daniele Nouy, the
head of the ECB's supervision unit, leaves at the end of the
year and may see the case as a test of her legacy. 
    One possible option to buy time would be to sell the Tier 2
instrument to Greece's bank rescue fund HFSF. Diluting
shareholders is not a preferred option for the bank, the source
said.
    The ECB declined to comment.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Italian officials
must stop questioning the euro and need to ""calm down"" in their
budget debate as they have already caused damage to firms and
households, European Central Bank ECB President Mario Draghi
said on Saturday.
    Italy's government has been locked in a war of words with
European officials over Rome's plans to triple the deficit next
year, backtracking on a previous pledge to narrow the budget gap
in one of the bloc's most indebted countries. [nL8N1WP21C]
    ""A budgetary expansion in a high debt country becomes much
more complicated... if people start to put in question the
euro,"" Draghi told a news conference in Indonesia at the
International Monetary Fund's annual meeting.
    ""These statements... have created real damage and there’s
plenty of evidence that spreads have increased in connection
with these statements,"" Draghi said. ""The results of which is
that household and firms pay higher interest rates on loans.""
    Italian bond yields rose sharply earlier this autumn after a
senior official from one of the ruling parties argued that Italy
would benefit from leaving the euro, comments he backtracked on
after the market backlash. [nR1N1RB01P]
    ""The very first thing (to do) is to calm down with the tone.
And then the second thing is we have to wait for the facts,""
Draghi said, stressing the need to examine the actual spending
plans, which may differ from the government's communication. 
    But Draghi also batted back accusations from some corners in
the Italian government that the ECB's own plan to phase out
asset purchases by the end of the year had caused the increase
in spreads.
    Draghi, a former governor of Italy's central bank, said
markets had not reacted in June to the ECB's decision to end its
asset buys but had moved specifically on local Italian issues.
    He pointed to the narrowing of the yield difference between
Italy and Greece as evidence that the problem is localised. 
    Since the ECB is buying Italian but not Greek bonds, a
bigger rise in Italian yields would suggest that investors are
not acting on overall ECB policy change but a local issue.

    By Jan Strupczewski
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 13 (Reuters) - As the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis petered out, European officials at annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund were happy to move
out of the spotlight over recent years. Europe was not in the
eye of the storm. 
    Until now.
    The IMF's annual meetings, normally held in Washington, this
year is taking place on the Indonesian resort island of Bali,
where a magnitude six earthquake welcomed the world's 20 top
finance ministers on the eve of their talks.
    But the tremor, which awoke many of the 10,000 officials
from all over he world around 3 o'clock in the morning on
Thursday, turned out to be less of a conversation topic than a
new menace to Europe's financial stability - Italy.
    ""If you talk to serious people here, everybody talks about
Italy,"" one European official said. 
    Investors and bank analysts at meetings with European
decision-makers were mainly interested in Italy and how the euro
zone could deal with it, officials said.
    ""The main topics at the meetings here are the trade war
between the U.S. and China and Italy,"" a second European
participant said. 
    ""On Italy, people ask us what is likely to happen and how we
are going to deal with it. They are alarmed but not in panic."" 
    Italy's new, populist government wants to increase borrowing
over the next three years to make good on election promises of
higher spending and lower taxes. 
    But with a debt pile of 133 percent of GDP, the second
highest in Europe after Greece, and relatively slow growth, Rome
can hardly afford such luxuries. 
    Markets also fret that Italian banks, saddled with bad
loans, and a massive amount of Italian government bonds, could
face crippling losses if debt prices keep tumbling. 
    Financial markets reacted to the Rome's plans with a sharp
sell-off of Italian bonds - three-year yields rose to five year
highs at an auction on Thursday and the benchmark 10-year paper
<IT10YT=TWEB> traded at 4-1/2-year highs.     
    The higher deficit also blatantly breaks European Union
budget rules, enforced by the European Commission, putting Rome
on a collision course with EU institutions once it sends the
draft budget for EU checks on Monday.
    
    TALKING THEMSELVES INTO PANIC
    Many officials are privately concerned about the possibility
of Italy sparking another sovereign debt crisis like the one
triggered by Greece in 2010 that nearly destroyed the euro zone.
Only Italy's economy is almost 10 times bigger than Greece's.
    But some also caution against doomsday scenarios.
    ""Here in Bali, something is happening that I have seen in
IMF meetings again and again. People focus on something that is
difficult and then everybody talks about it and, in the end,
everybody is convinced that it is much worse than before they
started. That is happening now with Italy,"" a third European
official said.
    ""I am worried, but it is not quite as bad as some people
here make it to be. They talk themselves into a panic,"" he said.
    Speaking at a panel on Thursday, Klaus Regling, the head of
the euro zone's bailout fund that would be called upon if Italy
could no longer borrow at sustainable rates, noted the euro
zone's third biggest economy had inherent strengths.
    Regling stressed Italy had a primary and current account
surplus, large private savings and that most of Italian debt was
held domestically, which made capital flight less likely.
    ""There is no immediate danger for Italy to lose access to
the markets,"" Regling told the panel.
    But Fitch ratings agency downgraded the outlook for Italy's
debt at the beginning of September and Moody's is waiting until
the end October to complete its review for a possible downgrade
of Italy's Baa2 rating. Standard & Poor's will assess Italy on
Oct 26.
    Regling said he did not believe Rome would lose its
investment grade rating, but other officials said that while a
downgrade by two notches may be unlikely, the ratings agencies
could also cut their outlook and that market reaction was
difficult to predict.
    ""Italian debt is sustainable unless there are serious policy
mistakes. At the moment they are making serious policy mistakes.
You can ruin any country if you do the wrong things,"" the third
official said.

    By Francesco Canepa
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Italian officials
must stop questioning the euro and need to ""calm down"" in their
budget debate as they have already caused damage to firms and
households, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on
Saturday.
    A senior member of Italy's ruling coalition shot back that
it was Draghi who should calm down, rather than draw attention
to occasional comments on the euro which were personal opinions
and had no implications for government policy.
    Italy's government is in a war of words with European
officials over its plans to triple the deficit next year,
backtracking on a previous pledge to narrow the budget gap in
one of the bloc's most indebted countries. [nL8N1WP21C]
    ""A budgetary expansion in a high debt country becomes much
more complicated ... if people start to put in question the
euro,"" Draghi told a news conference at the International
Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Indonesia.
    ""These statements ... have created real damage and there's
plenty of evidence that spreads have increased in connection
with these statements,"" Draghi said. ""The results of which is
that household and firms pay higher interest rates on loans.""
    Italian bond yields rose sharply this month after a senior
official from one of the ruling parties said Italy would be
better off with its own currency, though he later reiterated the
government's frequent reassurances that quitting the euro is not
in its programme and it has no plans to do so. [nR1N1RB01P]
    ""The very first thing (to do) is to calm down with the tone.
And then the second thing is we have to wait for the facts,""
Draghi said, stressing the need to examine the actual spending
plans, which may differ from the government's communications.
    Alberto Bagnai, a senator from the right-wing League who
heads the Senate finance committee, said Draghi himself risked
agitating markets by drawing attention to rare personal opinions
on the single currency that were not government policy.
    ""Draghi should calm down and stop mentioning the euro.
Nobody does it around here,"" he tweeted.
    Draghi also batted back accusations from some corners in the
Italian government that the ECB's plan to phase out asset
purchases by the end of the year had caused the increase in
spreads.
    Draghi, a former governor of Italy's central bank, said
markets had not reacted in June to the ECB's decision to end its
asset buys but had moved specifically on local Italian issues.
    He pointed to the narrowing of the yield difference between
Italy and Greece as evidence that the problem is localised. 
    Since the ECB is buying Italian but not Greek bonds, a
bigger rise in Italian yields would suggest that investors are
not acting on overall ECB policy change but a local issue.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank should keep its policy options open and not let itself be
influenced by the Federal Reserve, ECB policymaker Francois
Villeroy de Galhau said on Sunday.
    Encouraged by a recovery in euro zone inflation, the ECB
expects to stop adding to its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.0 trillion)
pile of bonds at the end of this year and has guided the market
to expect a rate hike some time in late 2019. 
    Villeroy said the ECB would soon decide how to reinvest the
proceeds of the bonds that expire next year but should not yet
commit beyond that point.
    ""We should keep our options open about the timing of our
reinvestment in the following years,"" he told a conference on
the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's annual
meeting in the Indonesian resort town of Nusa Dua.
    The French central bank governor added that rate-setters
should wait a little longer to clarify their guidance on
interest rates, which currently just says they will stay at
their current, rock-bottom level ""at least through the summer of
2019"".
    ""As we approach the summer of 2019, the balance will shift
in favour of detailing our forward guidance,"" Villeroy said.
    Six rate hikes by the Fed in 1-1/2 years have sent the U.S.
dollar rallying against the currencies of fragile emerging
economies such as Argentina and Turkey, forcing their central
banks to also increase borrowing costs to arrest the slide.
    The euro zone has been relatively insulated and Villeroy
said the ECB should proceed at its own pace.
    ""I think the euro area can determine its own course,"" he
said.

budget rules and must settle its differences with Brussels over
higher state spending in talks with the European Union's
executive, a senior International Monetary Fund official was
quoted on Sunday as saying.
    The comments by the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director
David Lipton to German business daily Handelsblatt came after
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi urged Italian
officials to stop questioning the euro.
    ""In our view, the Italian government should abide by the
European rules and agreements,"" Lipton said in an interview.
""The discussions on the draft budget must now be conducted
between Italy and the European Commission.""
    The Italian coalition has set a deficit target of 2.4
percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous goal
for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving investors and
prompting sharp criticism from the Commission. [nL8N1WP21C]
    Lipton warned that the budget dispute could delay planned
reforms to make the euro zone more resilient to external shocks.
""We hope that the further deepening of the monetary union will
not be hindered. We consider the completion of the Capital and
Banking Union to be very important,"" he said.
    A euro zone summit in December should bring progress on the
reform agenda, he added.
    Draghi said on Saturday that Italian officials need to ""calm
down"" in their budget debate as they have already caused damage
to firms and households. A senior member of the coalition
retorted that it was Draghi who should calm down. [nL2N1WT04J]
    Deeper euro zone integration has been championed by French
President Emmanuel Macron since his election last year, but has
run into opposition from Germany and its allies, wary of sharing
more responsibility with less fiscally prudent governments.
    EU leaders agreed in June that the ESM bailout fund should
play a bigger role in a more integrated euro zone, but left the
details to December and difficult issues such as a euro zone
budget or deposit insurance scheme until an unspecified future
date. [nL8N1TV3AV]

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - How toxic is it to be in Angela
Merkel's coalition? Certainly both her partners performed poorly
in yesterday's Bavarian election, with the right-wing CSU losing
its accustomed majority and the centre-left slipping below 10
percent. The emergence of the far-right AfD was a clear factor
but both parties also lost votes over the constant rowing in
Berlin over immigration and other matters. The CSU in particular
showed how to lose votes by trying to ape the populist rhetoric
of the AfD. The regional election in Hesse in two weeks' time
could now prove crucial: it will show whether Merkel's own CDU
party is also being damaged and will be a new test for the SPD.
Bad performances there could start prising the alliance apart.
    Failure at the weekend to break the deadlock on post-Brexit
Irish border arrangements is leading to more ""no deal""
speculation this morning. Now no further talks are planned ahead
of Wednesday's EU summit, which in turn raises the question as
to whether that meeting can produce any meaningful progress.
That in turn might prompt both sides to conclude that there is
not much point in holding a further one-off summit in November
to wrap the whole thing up. A degree of brinkmanship is all part
of the process but that can also be a dangerous game. UK Foreign
Secretary Jeremy Hunt will be in Brussels today as part of
regular foreign policy talks with EU peers; he will no doubt use
the meeting to sound out any possible ways to break the impasse.
    Italy's cabinet will today finalise its budget for next year
envisaging a deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product,
well beyond what the EU says is acceptable given its existing
debt. According to the process, the European Commission must
then decide whether to reject the budget and demand changes,
creating a stand-off with Rome. While Italy's bonds have sold
off, the government of League and 5-Star can count on some
popular support at home: A survey by pollster Demopolis on
Friday showed 52 percent of Italians backed the plan, compared
with 38 percent who gave it the thumbs down.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT         
World markets have turned tail again, reversing Friday’s
tentative recovery as a recovery in oil prices and rising
tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to the
cocktail of concerns that battered global stocks last week.
Outside of Wall Street’s main indices, emerging-market equity
benchmarks, European autos and banks and more than half the
constituent stocks of MSCI’s all-country world index are already
in bear-market territory, as defined by drops of more than 20
percent from this year’s cycle peaks. The Sino-U.S. trade war,
rising U.S. interest rates and bond yields and slowing world
economic and earnings growth have all been factors. On Sunday,
Saudi stocks closed down 3.5 percent as the Kingdom threatened
to retaliate over any measures by western governments to
sanction it over the disappearance of Washington Post journalist
Jamal Kashoggi. Many senior government and business figures and
financiers, including JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon,
have now pulled out of a major Saudi investment forum. Riyadh’s
insistence it will take counter-measures against any moves to
punish over the affair has jarred oil markets as many had
assumed Saudi would step up production to offset the loss of
Iranian crude caused by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Brent crude,
which had dipped back below $80 late last week for the first
time in almost a month, rallied to almost $82 on Monday.
    Concern about billions of dollars of Saudi investments in
western markets was also raised, not least the investments in
tech stocks. Shares in the Japanese conglomerate Softbank Group,
whose nearly $100 billion Vision Fund is almost half financed by
Saudi Arabia and is the world’s largest technology investment
vehicle, dropped 7 percent on Monday. 
    Asia markets were further unnerved by the imminent report
this week from the U.S. Treasury on possible currency
manipulation by countries seeking to gain a trade advantage with
the United States. China has long been in the spotlight, and
while most analysts don't expect China to be named, turning up
the heat on the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing,
there is some trepidation the Treasury may widen the list of
countries it’s looking at after Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin indicated new trade deals with countries such as Japan
would contain some form of  provision against currency
manipulation. Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo stock indices lost
more than 1 percent on Monday. MSCI’s emerging-market equity
index was down almost 1 percent too. European and U.S. stock
futures were also in the red. 
    Sterling fell against the dollar and euro, meantime, as UK
and EU Brexit negotiators failed to reach a draft agreement late
on Sunday ahead of Thursday’s critical summit on the issue, with
the Irish border problem still the main sticking point. Aides to
EU leaders meet again in Brussels on Monday and Irish PM Leo
Varadkar meets Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster in
Dublin. The dollar was firmer more broadly, although nerves
about global market stability saw the yen outperform and
dollar/yen fell back below 112 to its lowest since
mid-September. Euro/dollar was steady to a touch lower after
weekend regional elections in Bavaria saw heavy losses for
Chancellor Merkel’s CSU allies, largely in favour of the Green
party. 
    Italian 10-year government bond yields and sovereign spreads
over German equivalents slipped back a touch on Monday as the
Italian cabinet meets on Monday to approve the controversial
2019 budget and present it to the European Commission for
review. Italian deputy PM Luigi Di Maio on Sunday ruled out any
move to exit the euro, saying such talk was designed by
opposition parties to scare people. Portugal’s government bonds
were expected to rally on Monday after Moody's rating agency on
Friday upgraded its sovereign credit rating to Baa3 and a 
weekend cabinet reshuffle that saw a new economy minister
appointed.  Turkey’s lira has gained almost 0.7 percent to its
strongest since August since the release on Friday of U.S.
pastor Andrew Brunson from house arrest, a move expected to
improve U.S.-Turkey diplomatic and economic relations.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields felt
downward pressure on Monday as investors moved into less risky
assets on lingering risk-events such as U.S.-Saudi tensions,
Italy's budget and a lack of progress in Brexit talks. 
    German government bond yields remained close to two-week
lows after a strong performance following a shaky start for
global equity markets, with analysts citing a plethora of global
risks as the drivers of sentiment. This included a state
election in Bavaria at the weekend which delivered humiliating
results for parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition
government. 
    Escalating tensions between the United States and Saudi
Arabia over the disappearance of Washington Post journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, a stall in Brexit talks over the weekend, and
concerns over Italy's budget helped boost the bid for Bunds.
[nL8N1WU0H1][nL8N1WU0ED]
    This added to gains made on Friday after comments by
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, tempering the euro
zone's inflation outlook. [nL8N1WS26B] 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the region,
was last at 0.489 percent, opened decisively below 0.5 percent
at 0.48 percent, it's lowest level in almost two-weeks, having
last week recorded its strongest performance since August.
<DE10YT=RR>.
    The disastrous state election for Merkel's Bavarian allies
did little to derail the bid either. [nL8N1WT0IH]
    ""This reflects the ongoing lack of trust and likeablity of
the grand coalition (but) we need to see how that is reflected
in Berlin,"" said Christian Lenk, rates strategist at DZ Bank.
""The safe haven character (of Bunds) is the dominant moving
part.""
    Elsewhere, Portugal's rating were upgraded on Friday by
Moody's though this failed to give any significant boost to bond
yields which remained pinned near five month highs. [nL3N1WV2G4]
  
    Portugal's government bond yields opened around flat to one
basis point lower on Monday with its five year yield at 0.86
percent, and its 10-year yield at 2.02 percent <PT5YT=RR>,
<PT10YT=RR>.
    Moody's became the last of the big three ratings agencies
since the euro zone bond crisis to lift Portugal from junk
status. Moody's upgraded Portugal to Baa3 from Ba1.  
    While the move is unlikely to unlock fresh flows of capital
as Portugal is already part of the largest investment grade
indexes, it may help convince those investors who take a more
stringent view.
    ""Some investors take a fairly conservative view and if the
worst of the (ratings) improves, that may encourage them to come
back in,"" said Antoine Bouvet, rates strategist at Mizuho. 
    Portugal is rated BBB by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch. 
    Lower bond yields were seen across the euro zone, with even
Italian bond yields lower ahead of a cabinet meeting to approve
the controversial 2019 budget later on. 
    Horse-trading between Italy and international bodies such as
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund continued
over the weekend. But markets appear soothed after Italy's
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio on Sunday ruled out that the
government could take the country out of the euro zone, saying
such talk was no more than scaremongering by its political
opponents. [nL8N1WU0S4]
    Italy should abide by European budget rules and must settle
its differences with Brussels over higher state spending in
talks with the European Union's executive, a senior
International Monetary Fund official was quoted on Sunday as
saying. [nL8N1WU0HI]
    Italy's five year government bond yield was down eight basis
points to 2.98 percent, with its 10-year three basis points
lower at 3.55 percent <IT5YT=RR>, <IT10YT=RR>.

    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Brussels, the political heart
of Europe, could prove the centre of global market focus next
week as Italy's budget and Brexit talks overshadow economic data
and central banks.
    World shares were on course for their worst week since
February as a spike in U.S. bond yields, a U.S.-China trade war
and other global risks have combined to undermine sentiment.
    One such risk is an impending dispute between Italy's
eurosceptic government and the European Union over Rome's 2019
budget plans, which could lead the EU executive to the
unprecedented move of rejecting it.
    Euro zone countries, including Italy, have until Monday to
submit their draft budgetary plans to the European Commission,
winch which would have to warn Rome within a week if it planned
to trigger the rejection process. [nL8N1WR2UJ]
    The populist Italian government plans a deficit of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's
target, prompting investors to sell Italian bonds and pushing
the country's borrowing costs to five-year high at a bond
auction. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    EU leaders meeting in Brussels from Wednesday to Friday are
expected to spend time discussing Italy, even if it is not
formally on the agenda of an exceptional three days of talks
that will also see them meeting around 25 Asian leaders,
including the prime ministers of China and Japan.
    That agenda does include efforts to finalise a withdrawal
deal with Britain.
    Finding a way of ensuring an open border between Ireland and
Northern Ireland post-Brexit has been the main challenge.
    Indications in the past two weeks were that both sides were
inching towards a deal, boosting the pound, although the
stubborn border issue thwarted marathon talks on Sunday.
    Britain and the EU have called a pause in the Brexit
negotiations until leaders of member states meet in Brussels and
it is not clear what those leaders can agree to at a dinner of
27 on Wednesay before British Prime Minister Theresa May joins
them at a regular summit on Thursday. [nL8N1WU0H1]
    ""Now comes the crunch time,"" said economists at Commerzbank,
adding that there was the risk of a sharp correction if
negotiations drag on beyond this week.
    James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said
Italy's budget and Brexit would be in sharp focus in the week
ahead, along with the course of markets themselves.
    ""Are we going to get any calm returning to equity markets?
There's a lot of unsettling concern about the combination of
higher bond yields, geopolitical risk and the ongoing trade
tensions,"" he said.
    
    FED ON TRACK DESPITE TRUMP INVECTIVE
    In terms of data, September retail sales from the United
States are expected to reflect the strength of the world's
largest economy with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, a
49-year low, and wages picking up.
    The sales figures on Monay are seen up 0.5 percent in after
a mere 0.1 percent increase in August, the smallest rise in six
months.
    Such data should confirm the Federal Reserve in its
rate-cutting path, even if U.S. President Donald Trump has
called it crazy. The Fed increased interest rates for a third
time this year at the end of September and is expected to do so
again.
    ""That's going to be keeping the Fed on a rates-hiking and
tightening path, even though there is some concern in financial
markets right now,"" said Knightley.
    The week is set to round off with figures on Chinese
economic growth on Friday. The average forecast for expansion in
the third quarter is 6.6 percent, a shade lower than the 6.7
percent growth in the April-June period. 
    Anything lower than that could indicate that the trade war
with Washington, as well as a slowing property market, could be
dragging down the world's second-largest economy.
    Trade figures from China on Friday showed China's trade
surplus with the United States hit a record high in September.
    The data showed solid expansion in China's overall imports
and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat
tariffs with the United States, though that could provoke a
reaction from Trump. [nL4N1WP28H]

    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Euro zone banks have not made
enough progress in raising loss-absorbing capital and now may
face more difficult market conditions due to higher volatility
and widening spreads in sovereign yields, the bloc's banking
watchdog said on Monday.
    ""Not enough progress has been made there,"" European Banking
Authority's chair Andrea Enria told a banking conference in
Brussels, warning that the problem concerned large and medium
banks, but not the biggest systemic lenders, like Deutsche Bank
or Unicredit, who are instead ""very close to be fully
complaint.""
    Under international and EU banking rules, large banks must
issue a special loss-absorbing debt known as TLAC and MREL that
can be converted to capital if a crisis burns through their core
capital buffer.
    Enria said investors have so far shown interest in buying
this debt but warned that ""window of opportunity is closing
down"".
    ""Funding markets are not going to be as open and available
as they were until now,"" Enria said, citing increased
volatility, external events, widening sovereign spreads and
concerns on emerging markets as the main reasons for investors'
lower appetite.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A row between the eurosceptic
Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget could escalate in the coming days if the EU Commission
decided to trigger a procedure to reject the Italian budgetary
plans.
    The unprecedented move would formally begin a long legal
dispute that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy
until it is resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but has so far not been applied to any member
of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the possible
procedure and of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Oct. 15: This is the deadline for euro zone states to submit
to the EU Commission their draft budgets for the following year.
     
    Oct. 22: After the submission of draft plans, the Commission
has one week to identify ""particularly serious non-compliance
with the budgetary policy obligations"" of a state. Assuming
Italy submits its draft budget on Oct. 15, as is common
practice, the Commission will have until Oct. 22 to make its
concerns known to Italy.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to a run a structural surplus of 0.6
percent of its Gross Domestic Product in 2019, but the
government's new plans foresee instead a structural deficit of
0.8 percent of GDP. The structural balance excludes one-off
expenditures, for emergencies or natural catastrophes.  
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of 130 percent of GDP, which should instead fall,
under EU rules.
    
   Oct. 29: If the Commission decided to consider Italy's draft
budget non-compliant with EU rules, it has to reject it within
two weeks of submission. This deadline would expire on Oct. 29
if Italy submits its budget on Oct 15. Brussels would have to
explain in a written opinion its reasons for sending the budget
back to Rome for changes. 
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
regular monthly meeting which would put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 19: In the event its budget were rejected by the
Commission, the Italian government would have three weeks from
the date of the EU opinion to submit a revised budget. This
deadline would expire on Nov. 19 if the Commission's opinion was
adopted on Oct. 29.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 10: The Commission would have three weeks, likely until
Dec. 10, from the submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt
a new opinion in which it would describe Italy's overall
budgetary position and its impact on the whole euro zone.
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission is expected
to publish its economic forecasts up to 2020, which would show
whether EU calculations match Italy's growth, debt and deficit
projections which underpin budget targets. The data could pave
the way to sanction procedures if EU and Italian data differed
widely.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines. 
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just few
weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Oil group Cepsa,
LeasePlan and Tencent Music have delayed floats due to the stock
market selloff. That reasoning is dicey when others have listed
without much of a hitch. Tricky IPOs need buoyant investors.
With rates rising and Brexit looming, they may have missed the
window.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Spain's Cepsa on Oct. 15 postponed its planned initial
public offering. Owner Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi state investor,
had planned to raise about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) by
selling 25 percent of the company.
    - ""The most recent international economic developments have
sowed considerable uncertainty in international capital
markets,"" Cepsa said in a statement. 
    - ""In this scenario, the appetite of international investors
has retracted significantly, along with their willingness to
participate in stock market listings such as the one being
carried out by Cepsa,"" it said.
    - The previous week Tencent Music Entertainment, the owner
of China's most popular music app, delayed a U.S. share offering
according to an Oct. 12 Reuters report citing three sources. 
    - Dutch car-leasing company LeasePlan also shelved plans to
float in Amsterdam, blaming a global selloff in equity markets.
    - Shares in Knorr-Bremse, a German brake maker, closed at
81.64 euros on Oct. 12, its first day of trading. Its IPO was
priced at 80 euros.

at 24.06 euros at 0810 GMT on Oct. 15, compared with an IPO
price of 23 euros.

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tricky initial
public offerings require buoyant investors. With interest rates
and trade-war tensions rising, and Brexit looming, IPO
procrastinators may have missed their window. 
    Spanish oil group Cepsa <CPF.GQ>  on Monday became the
latest market hopeful to put its stock market debut on hold. It
joined Dutch car-leasing company LeasePlan [AAHALP.UL], which
was seeking a 7.5 billion euro price tag according to Bloomberg,
but last week said it would not proceed “due to market
conditions”. Chinese streaming service Tencent Music
Entertainment has also pressed pause on plans to raise $2
billion in a U.S. listing until equity markets have stabilised,
Reuters reported.
    Blaming markets is far from a catch-all excuse, though.
German brake maker Knorr Bremse <KBX.DE>  last week raised 3.9
billion euros with an offering priced in the middle of the
expected range; the shares are up slightly since. Shares in
Shurgard <SHUR.BR>, a self-storage group that priced its
Brussels IPO near the bottom of the range, rose about 5 percent
on its first hours of trading on Monday. And French solar power
specialist Neoen’s <NEOEN.PA>  offering was snapped up in a day,
according to a person familiar with the matter, after it pitched
shares at the lower end of its initial range. The lesson is
that, even in turbulent times, investors will support
modestly-priced companies with business models that are easy to
understand. 
    Yet prospective shareholders will use a bigger magnifying
glass when examining harder-to-value prospects. While Tencent
Music has a listed peer in Spotify <SPOT.N>, its strategy for
getting listeners to pay for music in piracy-heavy China is
unclear. LeasePlan struggled to reassure investors who were
worried that corporate clients would slash spending on company
cars in the next recession. Cepsa owner Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi
state investor, was seeking proceeds of 2 billion euros at a
valuation premium to Spanish rival Repsol <REP.MC>, based on
Breakingviews calculations.
    The trio may have missed the boat for a while. Europe’s
STOXX 50 index has not yet recovered from a worldwide market
rout on Oct. 10. So long as the Federal Reserve keeps tightening
monetary policy, higher bond yields are probably here to stay.
Add U.S.-China trade tensions and the fallout from a possible
no-deal Brexit next year, and it’s hard to imagine investors
taking a punt on dicey IPOs for some time.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Spain's Cepsa on Oct. 15 postponed its planned initial
public offering. Owner Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi state investor,
had planned to raise about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) by
selling 25 percent of the company.
    - ""The most recent international economic developments have
sowed considerable uncertainty in international capital
markets,"" Cepsa said in a statement. 
    - ""In this scenario, the appetite of international investors
has retracted significantly, along with their willingness to
participate in stock market listings such as the one being
carried out by Cepsa,"" it said.
    - The previous week Tencent Music Entertainment, the owner
of China's most popular music app, delayed a U.S. share offering
according to an Oct. 12 Reuters report citing three sources. 
    - Dutch car-leasing company LeasePlan also shelved plans to
float in Amsterdam, blaming a global selloff in equity markets.
    - Shares in Knorr-Bremse, a German brake maker, closed at
81.64 euros on Oct. 12, its first day of trading. Its IPO was
priced at 80 euros. 
    - Amsterdam-listed self-storage group Shurgard was trading
at 24.06 euros at 0810 GMT on Oct. 15, compared with an IPO
price of 23 euros.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The yen hit a one-month high and
the Swiss franc rallied on Monday as rising geopolitical tension
and further falls in equity markets left investors skittish at
the start of the week. 
    European stocks sunk to 22-month lows amid rising tensions
between Saudi Arabia and the West after the monarchy warned
against trying to punish it for the disappearance of a
journalist critical of its regime.
    That added to a number of concerns for markets globally,
including rising oil prices, the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade dispute
and a humbling election defeat for Chancellor Angela Merkel's
conservative Bavarian allies [nL8N1WU0ED] [nL8N1WV28Z]. 
    Merkel's allies suffered their worst election result since
1950 on Sunday, in a setback that raised tensions within the
country's crisis-prone national government [nL8N1WU02P].
    The euro, however, was little fazed. It rose 0.3 percent to
$1.1592 <EUR=> against the dollar as the greenback sold off
against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. 
    Analysts said the euro's fortunes over the next few days
would be determined in part by the Italian government's annual
budget, which the cabinet is due to approve later on Monday
[nL8N1WU0QF].
    ""I don't think it's (the German election result) a huge
political risk, but it does tell you that political risks in
Europe are not going away,"" said Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst
at Societe Generale.
    The yen rose as much as half a percent to 111.62 <JPY=>, its
strongest since Sept. 13. The Swiss franc, which investors also
tend to buy when markets are in flux, rose 0.4 percent against
the euro <EURCHF=> to 1.1423 francs and 0.6 percent versus the
dollar <CHF=> to 0.9853 francs.
    Valentin Marinov, head of currency strategy at Credit
Agricole, said a ""constellation of political risks"" was weighing
on sentiment and supporting yen and franc buying. 
    However, he said the moves were limited and did not suggest
a ""game changer"" for currency markets, which have remained
relatively calm amid recent equity market sell-offs.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=>, often seen as a barometer of
global risk sentiment, shrugged off the mood and rose 0.3
percent to $0.7141 against the dollar, suggesting investors were
far from panicked. The Aussie had hit a two-year low of 0.7039
on Oct. 5.
    There were also some signs stock markets were calming in
European trading.
    ""While the losses being reported are more modest than those
seen last week, which investors will hope represents some
stability and normality returning to markets, it will remain a
source of concern for now,"" said Craig Erlam, market analyst at
currency broker OANDA. 
    Sterling dropped 0.2 percent $1.3121 <GBP=> after Brexit
talks hit an impasse, before recovering to trade up at $1.3178,
propelled higher by the dollar's weakness [nL8N1WV1ZO].
    The pound fell 0.3 percent against the euro to 88.170 pence
<EURGBP=>.

 (Updates with more details, comment)
    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Portuguese and Italian government
bond yields fell on Monday, outperforming euro zone peers after
ratings agency Moody's upgraded Portugal's credit rating by one
notch back to investment grade and Italy's budget plans returned
to focus.
    Moody's is the last of the big three ratings agencies to
lift Portugal from the junk status acquired during the euro zone
debt crisis.
    Moody's upgraded Portugal to Baa3 from Ba1 after the close
of European markets on Friday, citing economic and fiscal
improvements. [nL8N1WS4W6]
    The move is unlikely to unlock fresh flows of capital as
Portugal is already part of the largest investment grade
indexes, but analysts said the upgrade may help to convince
investors who take a more stringent view. 
    ""The upgrade is still a positive point. Even though it is
not surprising, it may make investors have a second look at
Portuguese government bonds,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist
Christian Lenk. 
    Portugal's bond yields fell by up to four basis points.
Ten-year bond yields dipped briefly below 2 percent before
pulling back to 2.01 percent, down 1.5 bps on the day.
<PT10YT=RR>
    Italy's 10-year bond yield was down two bps at 3.56 percent.
<IT10YT=RR>
    Cabinet approval of Italy's 2019 budget has been delayed by
one day to Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on
Monday. Government sources said there were tensions between the
ruling coalition parties over plans for a partial tax amnesty.
[nR1N1VZ00W]
    ""The budget numbers have converged to a reasonable
compromise,"" said Nordea Chief Analyst Jan von Gerich. 
    ""But I don't think the numbers are credible and the targets
won't but met, but the biggest sell-off in Italy is behind us.""
    In contrast to Portugal and Italy, Spain's 10-year bond
yield hit fresh one-year highs at 1.706 percent <ES10YT=RR>. 
    Spain's Socialists, who hold a minority in parliament,
reached a budget deal on Thursday with anti-austerity party
Podemos that includes tax hikes and raising the minimum wage.
[nL8N1WR24E]
    ""We have started to see many accounts worrying about the
fiscal situation of Spain. We have been answering many questions
over this weekend, many investors are asking are the
implications of the new agreement between Podemos and the
Socialists,"" said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche. 
    Elsewhere, yields on higher-rated euro zone bonds dipped as
investors moved into less risky assets as U.S.-Saudi tensions
and Brexit talks dragged on.
    A weekend election in the German state of Bavaria that
delivered humiliating results for parties in Chancellor Angela
Merkel's coalition government may also have helped lift appetite
for safe-haven bonds. [nL8N1WV1BT]
    Germany's 10-year bond yield dipped to 0.478 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, its lowest in almost two weeks.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Euro zone banks have a large
shortfall in their loss-absorbing buffers and now face tougher
market conditions for building them up due to higher volatility
and widening spreads in sovereign yields, the bloc's banking
watchdogs said on Monday.
    Under international and EU banking rules, large banks must
issue special loss-absorbing debt known as TLAC and MREL that
can be converted into capital if a crisis burns through their
core capital buffer.
    ""Not enough progress has been made there,"" the European
Banking Authority's chair Andrea Enria told a banking conference
in Brussels. Enria said the problem concerned large and medium
banks but not the biggest systemically important lenders, like
Deutsche Bank or Unicredit, who are instead ""very close to being
fully complaint.""
    The shortfall stands at 125 billion euros ($145 billion) for
the bloc's 35 most complex banking groups, said Dominique
Laboureix, who is a member of the Single Resolution Board, the
EU body that handles failing banks and sets the level of
loss-absorbing buffers.
    These buffers are for use when a bank is in trouble. They
are seen as crucial to allow an orderly wind-down of a lender,
and should also reduce the cost to taxpayers of any banking
rescue.
    Enria said investors have so far shown interest in buying
this debt but warned that the ""window of opportunity is closing
down"".
    ""Funding markets are not going to be as open and available
as they were until now,"" Enria said, citing increased
volatility, external events, widening sovereign spreads and
concerns on emerging markets as the main reasons for investors'
lower appetite.
    
    BANKS FUND
    A sufficient level of loss-absorbing buffers is required for
banks to be able to access funding from the bloc's fund for
troubled lenders, the Single Resolution Fund (SRF).
    The SRF is expected to hold nearly 33 billion euros ($38
billion) in 2019, up from almost 25 billion this year, Single
Resolution Board chair Elke Koenig said on Monday.
    The board manages the fund, which is financed by euro zone
banks.
   The plan is to gradually increase the fund's holdings to at
least 1 percent of all covered deposits in euro zone banks by
the end of 2023, which is estimated to be between 55 billion and
60 billion euros.
    The fund will then have a backstop to face major banking
crises although the final details are yet to be finalised by
euro zone states.
    EU leaders agreed in June to give the state rescue fund, the
European Stability Mechanism, more powers to help the banking
fund, but its precise powers are expected to be clarified in
December.

    ATHENS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Greece's central government
achieved a primary budget surplus of 4.8 billion euros in the
first nine months of the year, well above target, thanks to
higher revenues and lower spending, finance ministry data showed
on Monday.
    The government was targeting a primary budget surplus --
which excludes debt-servicing costs -- of 2.52 billion euros for
the January-to-September period, meaning the surplus
outperformed the target by 2.29 billion euros.
    The central government surplus excludes the budgets of
social security funds and local administration. It differs from
the figure monitored by Greece's EU/IMF lenders but indicates
the state of the country's finances.
    Net tax revenue came in at 37.23 billion euros, 591 million
euros above target, while spending reached 36.93 billion euros,
1.54 million euros below target.
    The government projects a primary budget surplus of 3.8
percent of economic output this year, according to its 2018
budget. The bailout target is for a primary surplus of 3.5
percent of GDP.

 (Updates prices)
    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Portuguese and Italian government
bond yields fell on Monday, outperforming euro zone peers after
Moody's ratings agency upgraded Portugal by one notch, back to
investment grade, and Italy's budget plans came back into focus.
    Moody's is the last of the big three agencies to lift
Portugal from the junk status acquired during the euro zone debt
crisis.
    It upgraded Portugal to Baa3 from Ba1 after the close of
European markets on Friday, citing economic and fiscal
improvements. [nL8N1WS4W6]
    The move is unlikely to unlock major flows of capital as
Portugal is already part of the largest investment grade
indexes, but DZ Bank rates strategist Christian Lenk said:
    ""The upgrade is still a positive point. Even though it is
not surprising, it may make investors have a second look at
Portuguese government bonds.""
    Ten-year bond yields dipped briefly below 2 percent before
pulling back to slightly over, down two bps on the day.
<PT10YT=RR>
    Italy's 10-year bond yield <IT10YT=RR>was also down two bps
on the day at 3.56 percent after the cabinet delayed approval of
Italy's 2019 budget by one day to Tuesday.
    Despite apparent broad agreement, government sources said
there were tensions between the ruling parties over plans for a
partial tax amnesty. [nR1N1VZ00W]
    ""I don't think the numbers are credible and the targets
won't be met, but the biggest sell-off in Italy is behind us,""
said Nordea Chief Analyst Jan von Gerich. 
    In contrast to Portugal and Italy, Spain's 10-year bond
yield hit fresh one-year highs at 1.706 percent <ES10YT=RR>,
though it was set to close only marginally higher at 1.69
percent. 
    Spain's Socialists, who hold a minority in parliament,
reached a budget deal on Thursday with anti-austerity party
Podemos that includes tax hikes and raising the minimum wage.
[nL8N1WR24E]
    ""We have started to see many accounts worrying about the
fiscal situation of Spain. We have been answering many questions
over this weekend, many investors are asking about the
implications of the new agreement between Podemos and the
Socialists,"" said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche. 
    Elsewhere, yields on higher-rated euro zone bonds dipped as
investors moved into less risky assets as U.S.-Saudi tensions
and Brexit talks dragged on.
    A weekend election in the German state of Bavaria that
delivered humiliating results for the parties in Chancellor
Angela Merkel's coalition government may also have helped lift
appetite for safe-haven bonds. [nL8N1WV1BT]
    Germany's 10-year bond yield dipped to 0.478 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, its lowest in almost two weeks, before settling at
0.50 percent towards the close.

 ECB refinancing rate poll data

    By Mumal Rathore
    BENGALURU, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
end its bond-buying programme in less than three months, with a
low likelihood of an extension despite a cocktail of political
and trade concerns, economists unanimously said in a Reuters
poll.
    Having bought more than 2.6 trillion euros worth of mostly
government bonds since March 2015, the ECB has been slowly
trimming back its purchases, hoping it has already done enough
to bolster growth and inflation.
    The gradual reduction in the amount of monthly stimulus has
persisted even with plenty of evidence that euro zone growth
momentum peaked a long while back, and with additional economic
and political risks mounting.
    Still, all 70 economists who answered an additional question
in the latest poll, taken before the Italian cabinet was due to
meet on Monday to discuss its 2019 budget, said chances that the
central bank would extend its bond buying programme were low.
    Italy's cabinet was expected to approve on Tuesday the
budget, which envisages a jump in the deficit that has upset
financial markets. [nL8N1WV1L6]
    The latest Reuters poll of more than 80 economists taken on
Oct 9-15 also found that euro zone inflation would languish
below the central bank's target until at least 2021. 
    ""The essence of the ECB's strategy is a gradual end of the
net asset purchases of QE by the end of the year and possibly a
first rate hike in September or October next year,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, chief economist at ING.
    ""However, it is currently far too early to answer these
questions. Why should the ECB unnecessarily commit itself? As
illustrated by the current market turmoil, and doubts about the
strength of the global economy, too much can happen between now
and the end of summer 2019.""
    Minutes from the central bank's September meeting released
on Thursday showed ECB policymakers remained optimistic.
[nL8N1WR3P0]
    With euro zone inflation forecast to average just 1.7
percent this year, next and in 2020, below the ECB's 2 percent
target ceiling, the central bank was still expected to raise
interest rates in the second half of next year.
    The deposit rate will rise 15 basis points to -0.25 percent
in the third quarter and the refinancing rate to 10 basis points
from the current zero percent in the final quarter of 2019,
according to the latest poll.
    ""The ECB is next due to provide further details on its
reinvestment process and perhaps update its forward guidance and
we expect it to sound dovish, but stay short of indicating that
it will actively try to lengthen the duration of its purchases
during the reinvestment phase,"" noted Ebrahim Rahbari, director
of the global economics team at Citi in New York.
    ""And despite a few recent hawkish noises, it remains very
unlikely that the ECB would consider a rate hike before
September 2019.""
    In the meantime, private business surveys suggest the
escalating trade war is already hurting factories across the
euro zone, with the September reading showing overall business
activity slowing to a four-month low. [EUR/PMIS]
    The euro zone economy is expected to grow at a steady 0.4
percent rate every quarter through to the end of next year.
    Growth will average 2.0 percent this year, slightly lower
than the 2.1 percent predicted last month, the consensus showed.
    That was in line with the International Monetary Fund's
growth projections, which downgraded its view from July on a
weaker performance by major euro zone countries. [nL2N1WP03N]
    Euro zone economic growth is seen at 1.8 percent next year
and at 1.6 percent in 2020, both unchanged from the previous
poll.
    When asked about the likelihood of a euro zone recession in
the next year, the median of 43 economists was 15 percent. For
the next two years, the figure was 25 percent, unchanged from
August's poll.
    Findings in the latest Reuters polls were not very different
for top economies in the region. Economists cut their growth
outlook for Germany, France and Italy from a July poll.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - British PM Theresa May's cabinet
meets today with the all-too-familiar Brexit cloud hanging over
it. Whether deliberate or not on her part, the impasse over the
Irish backstop means ministers will not have any draft deal with
the EU to examine - and reject. Her hard Brexit colleagues will
therefore, for now at least, keep their resignation letters in
their pockets. This week's EU summit will accordingly be mostly
about deciding whether there has been enough progress in talks
to make it worth holding a special Brexit summit in November. EU
President Donald Tusk and Germany's Angela Merkel both insist
that everyone keep pushing. Even as fears of ""no deal"" cause
sterling again to shed some value, a Reuters poll of economist
suggest City observers still see some kind of an accord as the
most likely outcome, with the chances of a disorderly Brexit
rated at one in four.
    In the end, the Italian cabinet managed last night to
overcome some internal differences and sign off on an
expansionary 2019 budget that boosts welfare spending, cuts the
retirement age and hikes the deficit in a showdown with Brussels
over EU deficit rules. The European Commission will now assess
the fiscal framework over two weeks, and could dismiss it and
ask Rome to draw up a new one. The EU executive has never taken
this step since it was given beefed-up powers in 2013. Meanwhile
Italian government bond yields have narrowed the spread over
German peers after Economy Ministry Giovanni Tria said he was
confident he could explain Italy's plans to the European Union.
    With signs that tensions over global trade are gnawing away
at the eurozone economy, the latest survey on German investor
morale due from the ZEW research institute this morning will be
watched closely. Analysts expect the indicator to edge down
slightly.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
    Even though world markets have calmed somewhat after the
wild swings of last week, downward pressure persists and even
the still-robust incoming Q3 U.S. earnings are doing little to
ease end-of-cycle nerves. Wall St equity indices ended in the
red overnight and China’s main bourses did likewise again early
on Tuesday, with benchmarks in both losing about 0.6 percent as
an annual U.S. Treasury report on countries who may be
manipulating currencies for trade gains is due out later in the
day. Although China is not expected to be mentioned explicitly,
the report is expected to link new U.S. trade deals to
commitments on free-floating exchange rates. Chinese September
inflation readings came in largely as expected, easing on a
producer level but with consumer price growth picking up a
touch. The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields were slightly firmer
across the board, with a retreat of Japan’s yen helping the
Nikkei rebound more than 1 percent. European and U.S. stock
futures were flat to higher. Wall St stocks suffered a late,
tech-led selloff on Monday amid persistent worries that the
escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing will start
to reflect in earnings guidance from the big tech and industrial
stocks during the current reporting season. Alongside Goldman
and Morgan Stanley, Q3s from IBM, eBay and Johnson & Johnson are
due out later today. 
    This week’s tension between Saudi Arabia and Western
countries over the disappearance this month of a dissident
journalist in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate eased somewhat
overnight amid reports indicating Riyadh will say that 
Washington Post columnist Khashoggi died in a botched
interrogation. World markets had been jarred by the standoff
amid concerns any Western sanctions on the Kingdom would be met
with financial retaliation by the Saudis – threatening billions
of dollars in Western equities and the country’s cooperation in
maintaining global oil supplies just as Washington imposes
sanctions on Iran. After a rebound of the country’s main stock
index on Monday, Saudi’s riyal rebounded from two-year lows in
the spot and forward foreign exchange markets on Tuesday amid
the reports of Riyadh’s likely acknowledgement of the death. The
New York Times, citing a person familiar with the Saudi plans,
reported the crown prince had approved an interrogation or
rendition of Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi
government, it said, would shield the prince by blaming an
intelligence official for the bungled operation. Brent crude oil
prices were steady, holding above $80 after dipping briefly
below that threshold late last week. 
    In Europe, Italian government bond yields and debt spreads
fell as the government in Rome signed off on its
deficit-boosting budget plan and passed it on to the European
Commission for approval. Italian Economy Minister Tria said he
was confident he could explain the expansionary budget plans to
the EU. Sterling was steady ahead of this week’s European Union
summit on Brexit, with a draft agreement still elusive due to
disagreements over how to manage post-Brexit trade across the
Irish border. Lack of agreement this week would push the issue
into December’s summit, or possibly an emergency summit next
month. And even then support for any deal within the UK
parliament is uncertain and the chances of another snap general
election have risen. The potential for sterling volatility
around the headlines is high and has put traders off any big
directional bets on the pound. UK jobless and earnings data
later in the day will be watched closely, as will Germany’s
October ZEW investor confidence readings.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - World stocks nudged higher on
Tuesday, as focus turned to earnings season and a rebound in
Italian assets helped battered equities find firmer ground for
now.
    In Europe, shares rallied 0.4 percent and pulled back from
Monday's 22-month lows <.STOXX>. That followed gains in some
Asian markets, led by Japan's blue-chip Nikkei index, which was
up over 1 percent <.N225> after a decline of nearly 2 percent
the previous day.
    Gains in Italy's bond <IT2YT=RR> and stock markets <.FTMIB>
after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the
country's expansionary budget helped lift sentiment. The euro
also firmed <EUR=>.
    Calm in Italy -- a major source of turbulence in world
markets in recent weeks -- helped explain the recovery in risk
appetite on Tuesday, said Marchel Alexandrovich, European
financial economist at Jefferies in London.
    Stock market sentiment in Europe also got a boost from
expectations that earnings season will deliver double-digit
earnings growth for the third quarter [nL8N1WW1E8].
    ""If you look at what's happening here and now, it is an
improvement from what was happening a week ago,"" Alexandrovich
said. ""How long the stability lasts is anyone's guess."" 
    
    Calmer equity markets took the shine off safe-haven assets.
    Japan's yen <JPY=> was down a third of a percent against the
dollar, the Swiss franc <CHF=> edged away from almost two-week
highs against the greenback and gold <XAU=> dropped from
Monday's 2 1/2-month high as tension between the West and Saudi
Arabia triggered a fresh exit out of risk assets.
    The disappearance in Turkey earlier this month of a Saudi
journalist critical of Riyadh has provoked an international
outcry against the oil-rich kingdom.
    Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the death of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched interrogation, CNN and
the New York Times said on Monday [nL8N1WV2J2].
    That backdrop, together with nagging concerns about the
economic outlook, global trade tensions and higher U.S. interest
rates, meant a degree of caution prevailed.
    The blue-chip Dow <.DJI> has lost 4.5 percent this month, as
long-term Treasury yields soared to their highest level since
2011. Higher yields make equities less attractive.
    Chinese stocks closed lower on Tuesday <.SSEC> after data
showed factory-gate inflation had cooled for a third straight
month in September amid weaker domestic demand, reflecting more
pressure on the world's second-biggest economy [nL4N1WO0NV].
    ""The focus of the markets has turned to the Middle East due
to the Saudi incident. And with U.S. stocks still struggling,
other equity markets will have a difficult time bouncing
convincingly,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at
Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.
    
    ITALIAN BOUNCE
    Italian government bond yields fell as much as 12 basis
points across the curve, narrowing the spread over German peers
<IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>, after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria defended the country's deficit-hiking budget.[nL8N1WW1CU]
    ""The most important reason (for the drop in yields) is that
Tria is continuing to stick to the government and defending the
budget,"" said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. ""This is taken
positively by the market."" 
    In currency markets, the dollar gained 0.35 percent to
112.15 yen <JPY=> after slipping to a one-month low of 111.625
overnight.
    Switzerland's currency weakened to 0.9878 francs per dollar
<CHF=> after advancing 0.5 percent the previous day.
    The euro was a shade higher at $1.15930 <EUR=>. Sterling
gained 0.26 percent to $1.3179 <GBP=D3>, having bounced from
Monday's one-week low of $1.3080 amid a stalemate over the
post-Brexit status of Britain's land border with Ireland.
    There was some focus was on the U.S. Treasury's semiannual
currency report due later in the day, with investors waiting to
see Washington's view on China after media reports last week
that it has not labelled Beijing a currency manipulator
[nL4N1WS0AJ].
     Oil prices dipped amid expectations of an increase in U.S.
crude inventories, but signs of Iranian oil exports fell this
month kept losses in check.[O/R]
    Brent crude futures <LCOc1> fell 0.9 percent to $80.07 a
barrel.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - German investor morale darkened
more than expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as
concerns about an escalating trade dispute between the United
States and China and fears of a ""hard Brexit"" clouded the
outlook for Europe's largest economy.
    The ZEW research institute's monthly survey showed economic
sentiment among investors deteriorated to -24.7 from -10.6 in
September. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for
a reading of -12.0.
    ""Expectations for the German economy are dampening above all
due to the intensifying trade dispute between the USA and
China,"" ZEW researcher Wambach said.
    ""A further negative influence on economic and export
expectations is the danger of a 'hard Brexit', which is becoming
ever more likely.""
    The United States and China are locked in a bruising
tit-for-tat tariffs dispute that threatens to hurt global growth
as well as ""innocent bystander"" nations, IMF Managing Director
Christine Lagarde has said. [nL2N1WR05V]
    A senior EU official said on Tuesday that British Prime
Minister Theresa May's speech to parliament on Monday showed
reaching a deal on the country's exit from the European Union
will be even harder than expected. [nL8N1WW2GA]
    A separate ZEW gauge measuring investors' assessment of the
economy's conditions fell to 70.1 from 76.0 in the previous
month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for 74.5.
    Wambach pointed to political uncertainty at home as another
factor behind the growing pessimism among German investors.
    ""The situation of the governing coalition in Berlin is
perceived to have become more unstable, which also weighs on
economic sentiment,"" he said.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Monday to restore
trust in her government after the Bavarian sister party of her
conservatives suffered heavy losses in a regional election.  
[nL8N1WV211]
    The German economy is expected to have shifted into a lower
gear over the summer months, but the economy ministry said on
Monday that growth should pick up again in the fourth quarter.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - German investor morale darkened
more than expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as
concerns about an escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute and Britain
crashing out of the EU without a divorce deal clouded the
outlook for Europe's largest economy.
    The ZEW research institute's monthly survey showed economic
sentiment among investors deteriorated to -24.7 from -10.6 in
September.
    This undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a smaller
drop to -12.0. The indicator reached the same low-point as in
July, the lowest reading since August 2012.
    ""Expectations for the German economy are dampening above all
due to the intensifying trade dispute between the USA and
China,"" ZEW researcher Achim Wambach said.
    ""A further negative influence on economic and export
expectations is the danger of a 'hard Brexit', which is becoming
ever more likely.""
    The United States and China are in a bruising tit-for-tat
tariffs dispute that threatens to hurt global growth as well as
""innocent bystander"" nations, IMF Managing Director Christine
Lagarde has said. [nL2N1WR05V]
    British Prime Minister Theresa May's speech to parliament on
Monday showed that reaching a deal on the country's exit from
the European Union will be even harder than expected, a senior
EU official said on Tuesday. [nL8N1WW2GA]
    A separate ZEW gauge measuring investors' assessment of the
economy's conditions fell to 70.1 from 76.0 in the previous
month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for 74.5.
    Wambach pointed to political uncertainty at home as another
factor behind the growing pessimism among German investors.
    ""The situation of the governing coalition in Berlin is
perceived to have become more unstable, which also weighs on
economic sentiment,"" he said.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Monday to restore
trust in her government after the Bavarian sister party of her
conservatives suffered heavy losses in a regional election.  
[nL8N1WV211]
    The German economy is expected to have shifted into a lower
gear over the summer months, but the economy ministry has said
it expected growth to pick up again in the fourth quarter.
    For the full year, the government has lowered its growth
forecast to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent previously as trade
tensions abroad and a lack of skilled workers at home limit the
room for economic expansion. [nL8N1WR30F]
    The government has also blamed slower production in the auto
sector due to difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard
- the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).

    ROME, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italy has introduced a more
punitive and costly regime for tax losses that banks can book on
loan writedowns, according to the Italian budget.
    The document, seen on Tuesday, said the tax deductibility on
writedowns under the recently introduced IFRS9 accounting rule
will now be spread over 10 years rather than just one.
    It also said a 10 percent tax deduction rate on bank loan
losses for corporate and regional tax purposes had now been put
back to the end of 2026.
    In its 2019 budget, the government cuts tax benefits for
banks and insurance companies to raise money for higher welfare
spending and tax cuts in other areas.
    On Monday, the cabinet signed off on a 2019 budget that
widened its deficit, setting up a showdown with Brussels over
compliance with European Union rules.
    ""Compared to the peak of net bad loans reached in November
2015 of 88.9 billion euros the reduction, of 48.7 billion, has
been significant,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on
Tuesday.
    Italy's banks have spent years rebuilding their balance
sheets and reducing bad loans that had threatened to cripple
them.
    The budget document also tightened the screws on advanced
taxes that insurance companies have to pay on premiums. They
will have to pay in advance 75 percent of taxes on premiums in
2019 compared with the previous 59 percent.
    That rate will rise to 90 percent in 2020 from a previous 74
percent and to 100 percent as of 2021.
    ""We need to be very careful to dealing with these issues...
because we are one of the pillars of the national system,"" the
chairman of Italy's biggest insurer, Generali <GASI.MI>, was
cited by Italian news agencies as saying on Tuesday.
    Italy's coalition government, made up of the right-wing
League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has
said the budget will include no tax increases other than those
on banks and insurance companies.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Slovenia needs to increase its
productivity in order to be able to raise wages, the
government's macroeconomic institute UMAR said on Tuesday,
suggesting it will advise the government against general wage
hikes without such growth.
    Demand for higher wages has grown in the last year,
particularly in the public sector, partly due to the European
Union member's strong economic growth.
    The institute expects the Slovenian economy to grow 4.4
percent this year after 2017's 4.9 percent expansion, boosted by
higher exports, investments and household spending.
    But productivity in relatively low in Slovenia compared with
elsewhere in the EU.
    ""Slovenia lags behind the average EU productivity by 20
percent. We need to introduce good practices ... to achieve
higher value added and thus enable higher wages,"" the head of
the institute, Bostjan Vasle, told a conference on wages.
    UMAR, which does not represent the government's official
position, also suggested some wages could rise if the government
makes its wage policy more flexible so that people get paid in
line with the results of their labour.
    Police in Slovenia went on strike earlier in October to
demand wage hikes of about 15 percent, and several other public
sector trade unions are threatening industrial action, including
nurses and teachers. [nL8N1WH29V]
    The previous, centre-left government said earlier this year
that the public trade unions' combined wage hike demands
amounted to about 1 billion euros, which was not acceptable. It
did not complete wage talks at that time due to early elections
in June.
    Public sector trade unions resumed their demands for higher
wages as soon as the new minority centre-left government under
Prime Minister Marjan Sarec took power in September. 
    Vasle said public sector wages represent about 25 percent of
budget spending, meaning significant changes to those wages have
a big influence on the budget and the country's fiscal position.
    Slovenia hopes to run a budget surplus of about 0.4 percent
of economic output this year and 0.2 percent in 2019 after eking
out a 0.03 percent surplus in 2017.
    That should make it possible for the country to gradually
reduce the high public debt that built up in the years before a
banking crisis in 2013, when it only narrowly avoided having to
ask for an international bailout.
    The public debt is seen falling to 66.6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2019 from some 70 percent this year,
Finance Minister Andrej Bertoncelj said last week. [nL8N1WR47N]
While on a downward trajectory, that is still above the target
ceiling of 60 percent of GDP set by the EU.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - World stocks nudged higher on
Tuesday, as focus turned to earnings season and a rebound in
Italian assets helped battered equities find firmer ground for
now.
    European shares rallied 0.8 percent, pulling away from
Monday's 22-month lows <.STOXX>. That followed gains in some
Asian markets, led by Japan's blue-chip Nikkei index, which
closed 1.25 percent <.N225> higher after a decline of nearly 2
percent the previous day.
    The positive tone looked poised to extend into the U.S.
session, with stock futures trading higher <ESc1> <1YMc1>. 
    Gains in Italy's bond <IT2YT=RR> and stock markets <.FTMIB>
after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the
country's expansionary budget helped lift sentiment.
    Calm in Italy -- a major source of turbulence in world
markets in recent weeks -- helped explain the recovery in risk
appetite on Tuesday, said Marchel Alexandrovich, European
financial economist at Jefferies in London.
    Stock market sentiment in Europe also got a boost from
expectations that earnings season will deliver double-digit
earnings growth for the third quarter [nL8N1WW1E8].
    About 6 percent of companies in the STOXX 600 index are due
to report results this week, with the earnings season passing
its mid-point during the first week of November.
    Overall, third-quarter earnings for the index are expected
to have risen 14 percent, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data,
while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That compares
with the 21.6 percent growth seen for U.S. companies.
    ""If you look at what's happening here and now, it is an
improvement from what was happening a week ago,"" Alexandrovich
said. ""How long the stability lasts is anyone's guess."" 
    Calmer equity markets took the shine off safe-haven assets.
    Japan's yen <JPY=> was down a quarter of a percent against
the dollar, the Swiss franc <CHF=> edged away from almost
two-week highs against the greenback and gold <XAU=> dipped from
Monday's 2 1/2-month high as tension between the West and Saudi
Arabia triggered a fresh exit out of risk assets.
    Signs that Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the
death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched
interrogation helped smooth edgy markets [nL8N1WV2J2].
    But given a rout in stock markets last week -- fuelled in
part by concerns about higher U.S. interest rates, rising
Treasury yields and world trade tensions -- some caution
prevailed.
    On Wall Street, the Dow <.DJI> has lost 4.5 percent this
month, as long-term Treasury yields soared to their highest
level since 2011. Higher yields make equities less attractive.
    Chinese stocks closed lower on Tuesday <.SSEC> after data
showed factory-gate inflation had cooled for a third straight
month in September amid weaker domestic demand, reflecting more
pressure on the world's second-biggest economy [nL4N1WO0NV].
    ""Looking forward, a couple of key points that may drive
where markets go is the direction of U.S. Treasury yields and
U.S. earnings season,"" said Investec economist Ryan
Djajasaputra. 
    Meanwhile, German investor morale darkened more than
expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as concerns
about an escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute and Britain crashing
out of the EU without a divorce deal clouded the outlook for
Europe's largest economy [nL8N1WW2K2].
    
    ITALIAN BOUNCE
    Italian government bond yields fell as much as 15 basis
points across the curve, narrowing the spread over German peers
<IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>, after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria defended the country's deficit-hiking budget.[nL8N1WW1CU]
    ""The most important reason (for the drop in yields) is that
Tria is continuing to stick to the government and defending the
budget,"" said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. ""This is taken
positively by the market."" 
    In currency markets, the dollar gained 0.25 percent to
112.03 yen <JPY=> after slipping to a one-month low of 111.625
overnight.
    Switzerland's currency weakened to 0.9878 francs per dollar
<CHF=> after advancing 0.5 percent the previous day.
    The euro was steady at $1.15840 <EUR=>, while sterling
gained 0.5 percent against the dollar and the euro <GBP=D3>
<EURGBP=D4> after British labour data beat expectations.
[nL8N1WW27A] 
    There was some focus was on the U.S. Treasury's semiannual
currency report due this week, with investors waiting to see
Washington's view on China after media reports last week that it
has not labelled Beijing a currency manipulator [nL4N1WS0AJ].
    Oil prices fell on evidence of higher U.S. oil production
and increasing U.S. crude inventories, but reports of a fall in
Iranian oil exports helped limit losses.O/R]
    Brent crude futures <LCOc1> were down 0.8 percent to $80.17
a barrel.

hurdles
    * Murdered journalist Caruana Galizia denounced bank
wrongdoing
    * EU response hindered by weak rules on money laundering 

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has
reached a preliminary decision to revoke the licence of Malta's
Pilatus Bank after its chairman was charged with money
laundering, two ECB officials told Reuters, though legal hurdles
remain.
    The bank was accused of processing corrupt payments for the
Azeri and Maltese leadership by investigative journalist Daphne
Caruana Galizia, who was killed a year ago by a car bomb in
Malta [nL3N1S04HM](https://tinyurl.com/yd8nmmap).
 
    Serious gaps have since been found in the supervision of
Pilatus, but the limited options open to the ECB and European
Union regulators in this case and others over the past year have
served to demonstrate the bloc's weak legal framework for
countering money laundering.
    The ECB's supervisory board has already agreed to withdraw
the bank's licence, one ECB official told Reuters, but the
decision will be finalised only after some legal issues are
resolved.
    A second ECB source confirmed that the process of revoking
the bank's licence is under way but was more cautious on its
outcome until legal hurdles are overcome.
    Neither source clarified what legal issues the ECB is facing
to withdraw Pilatus Bank's licence, a move that many observers
had taken for granted after the Malta Financial Services
Authority (MFSA) recommended the withdrawal in June. 
    Reuters tried to contact Pilatus Bank several times but was
unable to talk to a bank representative. A spokeswoman for the
ECB declined to comment.
    Only after the murder of Caruana Galizia in October 2017,
for which there is no proven link to the reports she wrote about
the bank, did the EU begin investigating the Pilatus case.
    The Maltese took no action until the Iranian chairman of the
bank, Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad, was arrested in the United States
in March this year on charges of money laundering and sanctions
violation.
    After that arrest, the MFSA Maltese banking supervisor froze
the assets of the bank and recommended the withdrawal of its
licence.
    
    EU RESPONSE
    The EU has become engulfed in recent months by a rash of
banking scandals over suspected money laundering, involving
Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> and Latvia's ABLV among
others.[nL8N1WO4B0]
    Other cases have received less media coverage, such as a
Spanish investigation into the Luxembourg-headquartered
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which is accused
of having laundered hundreds of millions of euros through its
branch in Madrid [nL5N1LS3CB].
    Luxembourg fined the bank 8.9 million euros ($10.3 million)
last year, legal sources told Reuters, but a loophole in EU
anti-money laundering rules allowed the Duchy to avoid
disclosure despite international guidelines that recommend
publication of sanctions as a key measure to help prevent
financial crime.  
    Other loopholes in EU rules allowed the Maltese MFSA to
grant Pilatus Bank a banking licence in January 2014. 
    That triggered an investigation by the European Banking
Authority last year, but the watchdog was forced to halt
inquiries last month because EU rules are too vague and ""make it
difficult to conclude that there have been breaches of clear and
unconditional obligations"", the agency's chairman, Andria Enria,
told EU lawmakers in a letter seen by Reuters.
    These rules are not expected to change soon.
    The European Commission, which is in charge of proposing EU
legislation, has ruled out immediate changes to money laundering
rules after several reforms in recent years.
   The EU executive has instead proposed a limited overhaul of
the bloc's banking supervision, giving the EBA more powers to
investigate suspicious cases. However, the measures face
opposition from some EU states, led by Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, according to a confidential EU document seen by
Reuters. [nL8N1WI2C6]

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italy is set to introduce a more
punitive tax regime for banks, piling further pressure on a
sector that is suffering due to a spike in the country's debt
costs under a populist government.
    The Italian cabinet on Monday signed off on an expansionary
2019 budget, boosting welfare spending, cutting the retirement
age and hiking the deficit. [nL8N1WV1L6]
    The government's plans have frightened off holders of
Italy's 2-trillion euro debt, pushing the risk premium benchmark
10-year bonds pay over safer German Bunds to 3 percentage points
up from 1.3 in mid-May when the proposed measures first emerged.
[nL8N1WW1CU]
    Domestic government bonds account for 10 percent of Italian
banks' assets and lenders have seen their capital buffers eroded
by the falling value of their sovereign holdings.
    The ruling coalition comprising the anti-establishment 5
Star Movement and far right League is now looking to raise 3.3
billion euros in additional revenues from lenders next year. 
    The budget law spreads over a period of 10 years the
possibility for banks to deduct from their taxable income losses
booked under the IFRS9 accounting rule.
    The rule, which came into force in January, requires lenders
to book expected, and no longer just actual, losses on the value
of their assets. 
    Italian banks stepped up writedowns of soured debts under
the new rule in the first quarter to speed a clean-up of their
balance sheets following a deep recession that ended in 2014.
    The budget also said a 10 percent tax deduction rate on loan
losses for corporate and regional tax purposes had now been put
back to the end of 2026.
    Giovanni Razzoli, a banking analyst at Milan-based broker
Equita, estimated such a measure would slightly erode banks'
capital buffers and hurt their cash reserves but not their
earnings. 
    A government source told Reuters on Monday that banks may
also be prevented from deducting in full from their taxable
income interest paid introducing an 86 percent cap - in a hit to
banks' earning which Equita's Razzoli estimated at 4 percent.
    However, a Treasury source on Tuesday said such measure
could be replaced by others still under study.
    The budget document also tightened the screws on advanced
taxes that insurance companies have to pay on premiums. They
will have to pay in advance 75 percent of taxes on premiums in
2019 compared with the previous 59 percent.
    That rate will rise to 90 percent in 2020 from a previous 74
percent and to 100 percent as of 2021.
    ""We need to be very careful to dealing with these issues ...
because we are one of the pillars of the national system,"" the
chairman of Italy's biggest insurer, Generali <GASI.MI>, was
cited by Italian news agencies as saying on Tuesday.

    CARACAS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Venezuela is seeking to open
bank accounts in Asia and Europe to carry out hard currency
transactions, Economy Vice President Tareck El Aissami said on
Tuesday, as the OPEC nation seeks to overcome U.S. sanctions
that have hurt its foreign commerce.
    Hyperinflation-stricken Venezuela is in its fifth year of
recession, prompting a surge in emigration that has overwhelmed
its South American neighbors. [nL2N1WO15T]
    President Nicolas Maduro frequently blames a U.S. ""economic
war"" for Venezuela's chronic shortages of food, medicine and
other basic goods. Critics attribute the crisis to Maduro's
policies, including a complex web of currency controls and heavy
state intervention in the economy.
    ""The President has instructed the finance minister to begin
a new correspondence scheme in Europe and Asia for public
banks,"" El Aissami said. 
    He added that the government will sell 2 billion euros 
($2.32 billion) on its Dicom foreign exchange platform starting
in November or December, without describing the time frame. 
Official statistics show the government has sold just $75
million through Dicom auctions this year.    
     Cash-strapped Venezuela's reserves are at a 20-year low at
$8.825 billion, two-thirds of which are held in gold bars. 
    The euros would come from oil revenues, El Aissami said,
without providing a detailed breakdown. 
    In August, Maduro devalued the bolivar currency by 96
percent, hiked taxes and raised the minimum wage. But the moves
have not dented inflation, which the International Monetary Fund
forecasts at 1.4 million percent this year and 10 million
percent next year. [nL1N1V900V][nL2N1WP0KA]

expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
firmly tell Theresa May it is up to her to sort out divisions in
her own government over Brexit when she addresses them before
their summit dinner in Brussels tonight. Officials said they
expect the leaders to tell May they have little more to offer
since talks stalled on Sunday and they will step up preparations
for Britain to drop out of the EU with no deal. That being said,
media reports suggest EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said he
is ready to offer Britain a one-year extension of the transition
period due to end in December 2020 if it helps seal a
post-Brexit trade deal between the two sides. That of course
does not address the current sticking point of talks - the Irish
border wrangle - but will be held up by the EU side as proof of
its flexibility. Trade Minister Liam Fox also argues a longer
transition period will be required, The Times reports this
morning. 
    The EU's efforts to get a new all-encompassing treaty on its
ties with Switzerland look to be heading for failure, meanwhile.
Negotiations have in many ways mirrored those with the UK - in
Switzerland's case, labour rules protecting its high-wage model
from outside competition have rubbed up against the bloc's
internal market rules, notably on the free movement of people. 
Four years of negotiations have failed to produce a breakthrough
by the EU's mid-October deadline, with yesterday's talks also
ending in stalemate. A final failure to strike a deal would mean
no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes
for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered
EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical
devices, if pacts on mutual recognition of standards lapse.
Throughout the talks the EU has insisted on a strict
interpretation of its rules, aware that any concessions it makes
to Switzerland could weaken its position in the separate Brexit
negotiations.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
Earnings to the rescue. World stock markets have staged a
powerful rally over the past 24 hours, offsetting the gloom of
the past week as the first sweep of third-quarter U.S. earnings
eases concerns about any imminent slowdown in punchy U.S. profit
growth, still running at annual clip in excess of 25 percent.
Not only have the major banks such as JPMorgan, Citi, Bank of
America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley come in ahead of
forecasts, but Netflix stock surged more than 10 percent after
the bell on Tuesday as it reported subscriber growth well ahead
of expectations during the quarter. Leading the rest of the
so-called FANG internet stocks higher – Facebook, Amazon and
Google-parent Alphabet – the Netflix update helps soothe nerves
that the leading tech sector was about to roll over. Despite
trade war jitters, U.S. industrial production grew faster than
expected last month – countering the soundings from an
underwhelming retail sales report earlier in the week. U.S.
Treasury yields, which raced to seven-year peaks last week, have
also remained calm this week. They hovered close to 3.16 percent
again overnight despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest
broadside against the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. 
    The positive earnings and economics twist, helped by some
calming of relations between Western countries and Saudi Arabia
over how Riyadh plans to handle the disappearance of dissident
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate, saw all
three U.S. equity benchmarks jump more than 2 percent on
Tuesday. The VIX volatility gauge plunged below 20 percent to as
low as 17.5, almost half the peaks of last Thursday. MSCI’s
all-country index of world stocks rose 1.7 percent on Tuesday,
its biggest one-day gain since June 2016, and extended that move
this morning. It’s now re-captured about a quarter of the points
loss it suffered over the past month. The return to risk lifted
Asia bourses too, with Tokyo and Seoul gaining more than 1
percent but Shanghai underperforming with a more modest 0.6
percent rise as the U.S. Treasury report on currency
manipulation around the world is still awaited. The overall mood
shift has also helped emerging-market currencies regain some
lost ground against the dollar. A monthly survey of fund
managers conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed
investors viewing emerging-market currencies as being at their
most undervalued in the history of the poll. Although the dollar
was firmer first thing on Wednesday, some of the worst-hit
emerging-market currencies – such as Argentina’s peso, Turkey’s
lira, Brazil’s real, India’s rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah – all
regained some lost ground over the past day or so.
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set to help lift
European shares further from the 22-month low hit last week with
futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set of
corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML
and drug giant Roche. Overall, European third-quarter earnings
are expected to rise 13.6 percent, down from the 14 percent
growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES.

    MADRID, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The ageing of Europe's population
could permanently constrain monetary policy, leading to longer
recessions and weaker recoveries, European Central Bank chief
economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday.
    Europe's demographic shift is already lowering interest
rates, leaving the ECB with decreased conventional firepower and
raising the risk that it would more often miss its inflation
objective, Praet said in Madrid.
    The ECB has undershot its target for the past five years and
inflation is not set to hit the bank's objective of almost 2
percent before the end of the decade, suggesting that monetary
policy may have lost some of its potency even as the bank used
unprecedented firepower to stimulate the economy.
    ""We should be wary about permanently placing a large burden
on central banks to deploy tools to counter problems that are
ultimately caused by structural economic and financial
inefficiencies,"" Praet said. 
    While unconventional tools have been effective for now,
Praet argued, the neutral interest rate, often called the
equilibrium rates, has fallen sharply as the population's ageing
has increased savings, lowered productivity growth and lifted
the number of pensioners in relation to active workers. 
    ""Recessions may last longer, and recoveries may be slower
and shallower, with a higher risk throughout of missing the
objective,"" Praet said, referring to the impact of low
equilibrium interest rates on ECB policy.
    Praet added that possible solutions could include raising
the retirement age and policies that encourage labour force
participation, for example through increased labour mobility or
more effective skills training. 
    He also called for policies to revive productivity growth,
particularly in spreading productivity enhancing measures across
borders and to all corners of the currency bloc.

in September in line with market expectations, driven mainly by
a spike in energy prices, but core inflation, which excludes
energy and unprocessed food costs, edged lower, data showed on
Wednesday.
    The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said
consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.5
percent month-on-month in September for a 2.1 percent
year-on-year rise, matching expectations of economists polled by
Reuters.
    Energy prices were the biggest single contributor to the
year-on-year gain, adding 0.9 point to the overall outcome.
Services added 0.57 point and food , alcohol and tobacco added
0.51 point.
    Excluding the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices,
in what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices
grew 0.3 percent month-on-month for a 1.1 percent year-on-year
gain, slowing from 1.2 percent in August and 1.3 percent in
July.
    The ECB wants to keep the headline inflation number below,
but close to 2 percent over a two-year horizon and is planning
to stop at the end of the year a programme of purchases of
government bonds on the secondary market which was designed to
boost inflation closer to the target.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ahead of a European Union
summit on Wednesday, as Italy weighs expansionary budget plans
that risk EU rejection.
    Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, has prepared

authorities in Brussels over compliance with EU rules. The
European Commission may reject the plans. [nL8N1WV1L6]

their own economic and budget policy.
    ""Each state in the euro zone is obliged to take care of
stability and to take necessary reforms for its competitiveness
- and that applies now in good economic times,"" she added.
    ""At the same time, as we have learned from painful
experience, in a currency union we are so closely intertwined
with one another that national policies can always have effects
on the other member states.""
    She said stable budgets were an important condition for good
economic development in each individual country, adding: ""Solid
public finances are also a condition for trust in the currency
union."" 
    ""Our guide remains the Stability and Growth Pact. I will
continue to make the case that in Europe this principle applies:
responsibility and solidarity, liability and control - those are
two sides of the same coin,"" she added to laud applause.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italy may have to act to contain
a surge in its borrowing costs sooner than comments from the
ruling coalition government suggest.
    The economy minister pledged this month to do whatever was
needed if the 10-year bond yield gap over Germany - effectively
the risk premium on Italian bonds - widened to 400 or 500 basis
points [nS8N1PA07Q]. And with significant risk already priced
in, a further blowout in the spread is unlikely for now.
    But lawmakers' comments suggest the issue remains a
contentious point as Italy draws up its spending plans, given
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's controversial vow to
expand the budget deficit whatever the ""lords of the spread"" -
i.e, bond investors - may think.
    Such remarks underline the importance of the spread and how
wide it would have to get before Rome finds it intolerable.
    The Italy-Germany spread is now around 305 bps, near its
widest in five years. It has swelled 150 bps this year, the most
since 2011, as Rome's budget plans create tension with the
European Union and put Italian credit ratings at risk of
downgrades.
    But some market watchers say that rather than the 400-500
bps spread Italian officials have mentioned, the pain threshold
is closer to 350-360 bps. Those levels - consistent with 10-year
Italian bond yields of around 4 percent - would likely trigger a
sharper rise in borrowing costs and contagion across the bloc,
they say.
    ""At 350-400 bps it becomes very hard for investors to stay
calm on Italian bonds,"" said Michael Leister, head of rates
strategy at Commerzbank. ""It would show there is not a quick
solution to the Italian problem.""
    In short, it's the spread widening impact on banks and
Italy's ability to fund its borrowing that's at stake.
    Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at U.S.-based
broker dealer INTL FCStone, said Italy cannot afford to pay more
than 4 percent on its debt over long periods of time without
falling into a ""public death loop"" where servicing costs make
debt growth faster than economic growth even if Rome keeps a
primary fiscal surplus.
    Given that Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 130 percent,
its debt-servicing costs at a 4 percent interest rate come to
about 5 percent of gross domestic product, he said.
    ""If nominal GDP in Italy grows by 3 percent at best, that
means that the government would need to maintain a primary
surplus of 2 percent just to keep the debt constant,"" Deluard
added.
    The primary budget surplus — the budget balance net of
interest spending — is targeted at 1.8 percent this year, up
from 1.4 percent in 2017 but still short of that 2 percent.
    Citi analysts say 10-year bond yields above 4 percent - 50
bps up from current levels <IT10YT=RR> - could be the ""tipping
point"" for selling to accelerate. Goldman Sachs reckons a
sustained spread move through 300 bps would require action from
Italy or the EU.
    J.P. Morgan adds that higher spreads over time add
cumulatively to the interest expenses and ""eat up fiscal space.""
    ""As a rule of thumb, we consider that 100 bps increase in
the yield curve leads to a roughly 0.15 percent of GDP increase
in interest payments in a given year,"" the bank said in a note.
    So far the economy and public have not felt the full effect
of the spread widening as many household lending benchmarks are
still essentially linked to official ECB interest rates. Italian
mortgages are priced against Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered
Rate) and not Italy's sovereign yield curve.
    Furthermore, Italy has taken advantage of low borrowing
costs in recent years to extend the average remaining maturity
of its debt to around seven years. That means rising yields take
longer to feed into higher debt refinancing costs. [nL5N1SM4LF]
    
    PAIN TRADE
    But the yield spike and wider spreads do increase borrowing
costs at bond auctions. A three-year bond sale last week saw
Italy pay its highest borrowing rate in five years, although the
auction size was small at 3.5 billion euros. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    According to UniCredit, the Italian government has raised
325 billion euros in bills and bonds so far this year at an
average cost of just below 1 percent, mostly to refinance
maturing debt, which carried a cost of 1.3 percent on average.
    But the length of time these elevated costs persist is as
important as the peaks and troughs they may briefly hit, and
problems will mount if yields stay high into next year.
    Rabobank head of rates strategy Richard McGuire says a rise
in the weighted-average yield of Italian bonds is worrying as it
is consistent with a rising path in debt servicing costs.
    He estimates that a yield at a weighted-average maturity of
2.63 percent would keep debt/GDP levels constant. An Italian
bond maturing in June 2025, the closest in duration to the
weighted average maturity, has a yield of 3.06 percent
<IT509031=>.
    A more immediate hit is being felt by banks. Italian lenders
hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds - accounting for
10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by eroding
the value of those holdings, eats into their capital levels.
    Any widening of the spread to 400 bps would force some
lenders to tap investors for cash, the Italian traders'
association Assiom Forex said recently. [nL8N1WH52F]
    Morgan Stanley estimates that the overall impact of spread
widening since the second quarter on Italian banks' capital
levels is between 1 and 14 bps.
    Based on the size of their bond portfolios and the starting
levels of their Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - a core measure of a
bank's financial strength from a regulator standpoint - Banco
BPM, UBI and BMPS are most vulnerable, Morgan Stanley said.
    It's no surprise that a jump in Italian yields is usually
accompanied by a plunge in bank stocks, often spilling into
European markets.
    In that environment, confidence in policymakers' ability to
stop market turmoil turning into a crisis can easily evaporate,
forcing them to act quickly. 
    May offered proof; spreads briefly topped 300 bps on fears
of a snap election that could become a de facto referendum on
euro membership. 5-Star and the League - the parties comprising
Italy's coalition - the quickly moved to form a government.
    An unwinding of ECB stimulus and higher U.S. Treasury yields
also make for a volatile backdrop.
    Contagion into the euro zone has been remarkably subdued
considering Italy is the bloc's third-biggest economy. That too
may change. 
    One channel could be the investment industry, should Italian
bond losses force fund managers to sell Spanish or Portuguese
debt to protect portfolio returns for the year.
    ""Like it or not, the development of the Italy-Germany spread
will decide the performance of most euro bond portfolios this
year, even those not invested in Italy,"" said Commerzbank's
Leister.

    * Outside risks may warrant more gradual tightening
    * Dedek sole voice for stable rates at last meeting
    * Does not say how he will vote at Nov 1 meeting

    By Robert Muller and Jason Hovet
    PRAGUE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Czech National Bank may need
to take a more gradual approach to raising interest rates while
it assesses risks from abroad, and a slower pace would not be
threat to meeting its inflation target, board member Oldrich
Dedek said in an interview.
    Dedek, the lone vote on the seven-member board against
raising rates costs at the last monetary policy meeting, said he
did not see evidence backing arguments that inflationar pressure
in the domestic economy was starting to materialise.
    He told Reuters he agreed with moving ahead with normalising
policy, but he believed there should be debate on the pace.
    ""A somewhat holding tactic ... does not collide with meeting
the inflation target. That is important for me,"" he said on
Wednesday.
    The central bank has raised its key two-week repo rate
<CZCBIR=ECI> at its last three meetings, to 1.50 percent. 
    Since ending a four-year-old intervention regime keeping the
crown weak in 2017, the bank has lifted rates from near zero in
six steps, the most aggressive tightening in the European Union,
as the European Central Bank and others in the region keep loose
policy in place.
    Markets see good chances of another hike this year, although
central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok said the timing of the next
move was uncertain after the last meeting, on Sept. 26. 
    Czech policymakers are contending with a fast-growing
economy, the biggest wage increases in 15 years, the lowest
unemployment in decades, along with home prices rising at one of
the fastest rates in the EU.
    Dedek said global risks, such as trade war escalation and  
uncertainty over Britain's exit from the EU, should be taken
into account, even if they could not be completely factored into
the bank's staff forecasts.
    For example, he said, the rising risk of a hard Brexit could
hurt Germany, which is the main Czech trading partner.
    ""To accelerate the (tightening) pace at the moment when
global risks are growing, that may be a point to discus, that is
why I eventually decided not to support raising rates (at the
last meeting),"" he said.
    
    NO COMMITMENT
    Dedek did not say how he would vote at the bank's next
meeting, on Nov. 1, when new staff forecasts will be presented.
    He said while it was not possible to completely factor in
outside risks to the outlook, ""the minimum could be to accept it
via a bit more gradual approach to normalisation (of policy). To
wait and see how the data will come out, whether the risks are
really materialising.""
    He added: ""But it is not about changing the philosophy of
(our) monetary policy, it really is about the pace, knowing that
a slower one does not threaten meeting the inflation target,
which is the key issue for me.""
    On the crown, Dedek said its weakness has been caused by
foreign risks, even though Czech economic fundamentals showed it
should be strengthening.
    The crown <EURCZK=> traded at around 25.83 to the euro on
Wednesday. Its three-month average is 25.75 versus the
assumption of an average third-quarter rate of 25.8 seen in the
central bank's current outlook, which also sees it strengthening
to 25.3 in the fourth quarter.

1503,3668,aa95a4e355d5925d857a1f6acdf02447,EU right to criticise Italy's budget - ECB's Weidmann,2018-10-18 1:00:01,EUR,7.43851,2018-10-18 1:00:22,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    FRANKFURT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission is
right to be critical of Italy's budget proposal, Bundesbank
President Jens Weidmann said on Wednesday, adding that Rome must
obey its fiscal commitments.
    Taking the unusual step of commenting on another euro zone
member's domestic politics, Weidmann argued that monetary policy
normalisation will place an increasing burden on highly indebted
countries so there is no place for leniency with Rome.
    Italy is locked in a showdown with Brussels over its plans
to raise its deficit to 2.4 percent of its economic output,
breaching the EU's requirement for it to cut the fiscal
shortfall.
    With a debt burden equivalent to 130 percent of its GDP,
Italy is one of Europe's most indebted countries. Some investors
fear that any big selloff in Italian assets could also spread to
other weaker members of the euro zone, potentially derailing the
bloc's recovery.
    ""As part of the necessary monetary policy normalization,
interest rates will rise again and that will place a heavy
burden on highly indebted countries,"" Weidmann, often mentioned
as a potential candidate to replace ECB President Mario Draghi,
said in Berlin.
    ""The European Commission has therefore rightly made a very
critical comment on Italy's recent budget plans and the breach
of the rules,"" said Weidmann, who sits on the European Central
Bank's Governing Council.
    A previous critic of Italian fiscal prudence, Weidmann has
been involved in public spats with Italy's government in the
past. In 2016, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told Weidmann
to fix Germany's banks before criticising Rome.
    This open hostility has led some in Italy to question
Weidmann's qualifications to succeed Draghi, and his diplomatic
skills are seen as a disadvantage in the race for the top ECB
job, which comes up at the end of next year.
    ""With this (deficit increase), the structural balance would
deteriorate noticeably, and the very high level of debt would at
best decrease only slightly,"" Weidmann said. 
    He added that concerns over the budget are pushing up the
premium investors demand for holding Italian debt, which
restricts the country's scope for more spending as debt service
costs rise.
    Earlier on Wednesday, EU budget commissioner Guenther
Oettinger said that in his ""personal"" opinion, the EU was very
likely to ask Italy to correct the draft budget.

    ""As a rule of thumb, we consider that 100 bps increase in
the yield curve leads to a roughly 0.15 percent of GDP increase
in interest payments in a given year,"" the bank said in a note.
    So far the economy and public have not felt the full effect
of the spread widening as many household lending benchmarks are
still essentially linked to official ECB interest rates. Italian
mortgages are priced against Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered
Rate) and not Italy's sovereign yield curve.
    Furthermore, Italy has taken advantage of low borrowing
costs in recent years to extend the average remaining maturity
of its debt to around seven years. That means rising yields take
longer to feed into higher debt refinancing costs. [nL5N1SM4LF]
    
    PAIN TRADE
    But the yield spike and wider spreads do increase borrowing
costs at bond auctions. A three-year bond sale last week saw
Italy pay its highest borrowing rate in five years, although the
auction size was small at 3.5 billion euros. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    According to UniCredit, the Italian government has raised
325 billion euros in bills and bonds so far this year at an
average cost of just below 1 percent, mostly to refinance
maturing debt, which carried a cost of 1.3 percent on average.
    But the length of time these elevated costs persist is as
important as the peaks and troughs they may briefly hit, and
problems will mount if yields stay high into next year.
    Rabobank head of rates strategy Richard McGuire says a rise
in the weighted-average yield of Italian bonds is worrying as it
is consistent with a rising path in debt servicing costs.
    He estimates that a yield at a weighted-average maturity of
2.63 percent would keep debt/GDP levels constant. An Italian
bond maturing in June 2025, the closest in duration to the
weighted average maturity, has a yield of 3.06 percent
<IT509031=>.
    A more immediate hit is being felt by banks. Italian lenders
hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds - accounting for
10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by eroding
the value of those holdings, eats into their capital levels.
    Any widening of the spread to 400 bps would force some
lenders to tap investors for cash, the Italian traders'
association Assiom Forex said recently. [nL8N1WH52F]
    Morgan Stanley estimates that the overall impact of spread
widening since the second quarter on Italian banks' capital
levels is between 1 and 14 bps.
    Based on the size of their bond portfolios and the starting
levels of their Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - a core measure of a
bank's financial strength from a regulator standpoint - Banco
BPM, UBI and BMPS are most vulnerable, Morgan Stanley said.
    It's no surprise that a jump in Italian yields is usually
accompanied by a plunge in bank stocks, often spilling into
European markets.
    In that environment, confidence in policymakers' ability to
stop market turmoil turning into a crisis can easily evaporate,
forcing them to act quickly. 
    May offered proof; spreads briefly topped 300 bps on fears
of a snap election that could become a de facto referendum on
euro membership. 5-Star and the League - the parties comprising
Italy's coalition - the quickly moved to form a government.
    An unwinding of ECB stimulus and higher U.S. Treasury yields
also make for a volatile backdrop.
    Contagion into the euro zone has been remarkably subdued
considering Italy is the bloc's third-biggest economy. That too
may change. 
    One channel could be the investment industry, should Italian
bond losses force fund managers to sell Spanish or Portuguese
debt to protect portfolio returns for the year.
    ""Like it or not, the development of the Italy-Germany spread
will decide the performance of most euro bond portfolios this
year, even those not invested in Italy,"" said Commerzbank's
Leister.

Politics

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - British PM Theresa May's
encounter with her EU peers yielded nothing materially new, as
expected, but at least the post-summit mood appears to be less
poisonous than that after the Salzburg meeting of a few weeks
back. Provisional plans for a one-off November summit have been
put on hold unless Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier spots major
progress between now and then. That could end up compressing the
timeframe for a deal further - but then there was always a
strong chance that this would have to go down to the wire at the
EU's regular December summit anyhow. UK media have latched onto
EU officials' statements that May said she would consider a
proposal to extend the post-Brexit transition by a year if
needed (""Brextra Time! screams a dismayed Sun headline) and hard
Brexiters at home are predictably enraged. With May having left
Brussels, EU leaders now get down to other matters such as
strengthening the eurozone, with final news conferences due mid-
to late-afternoon. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he sees no
room for changing the Italian draft budget for 2019 ahead of the
meeting in Rome this afternoon between EU Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria. The two are due to
hold a joint news conference at which Moscovici could give the
clearest signals yet about what action Brussels intends to take
on the expansionary budget. Separately, in what is surely a jibe
at critics in Berlin and elsewhere, Italian Deputy Prime
Minister Matteo Salvini is being quoted as saying he may
consider running for the presidency of the European Commission,
the watchdog of the EU's rules.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
This week’s world market bounce has faded fast as hawkish noises
from the Federal Reserve, some negative earnings surprises and
the U.S. Treasury’s report on trade-related currency
manipulation have all quickly eclipsed any renewed optimism.
Although the Treasury report didn’t formally designate China as
a currency manipulator, it detailed concerns about how Beijing
has allowed the yuan to slide this year as U.S. tariffs were
imposed and it was widely seen as a warning about further trade
restrictions. The onshore yuan has fallen to its lowest since
January last year and Shanghai stocks plummeted more than 2
percent to their lowest in four years – now down more than 30
percent from 2018’s peaks and fully half their levels just three
years ago. Other Asia bourses from HK to Seoul to Tokyo were all
in the red too, but all by less than 1 percent. The minutes of
the Fed’s latest policy meeting added to the angst, showing the
decision to raise rates last month was unanimous and the
policymaking committee all behind further tightening despite
repeated criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. 
    The combination of Fed and China fears pushed 10-year
Treasury yields back above 3.2 percent for the first time in
over a week, lifting the dollar broadly. Euro/dollar skidded
below $1.15 overnight, the dollar’s DXY index was higher and
Japan’s yen outperformed amid the fresh equity market jitters.
Wall St stocks ended slightly lower late Wednesday, with
disappointing Q3 updates from the likes of IBM and Home Depot
souring the mood along with the spikey Fed minutes. The Chinese
nerves and higher dollar dragged MSCI’s emerging market index
down 0.8 percent early Thursday and a tentative recovery in many
emerging market currencies was stopped in its tracks. 
    Sterling was weaker against the euro and dollar as
indications from this week’s European Union summit on Brexit
were that a deal with the UK was still some way off and there
was insufficient progress to call a special summit on the issue
for November. That now pushes the timeline to December 14’s
summit and right to the wire for parliamentary approval in time
for a formal exit from the bloc next March. Softer-than-forecast
UK inflation numbers for September also weighed on the pound,
with traders eyeing today’s retail sales report for further
guidance. Italy’s 10-year bond yield spreads over Germany
widened back out to 310 basis points for the first time in a
week as Italy prepared to tap syndicated international bond
markets and amid reports of some divisions within the ruling
Italian coalition government over different measures in its
controversial deficit-boosting budget. Italian PM Conte insisted
on Thursday there were no splits in the government over the
budget and expected constructive dialogue with Brussels despite
expected criticism. 
    Europe Inc goes further into a Q3 season in which it can’t
afford to disappoint if it is to end 2018 in positive territory
or try to catch up with a buoyant Wall Street. With expectations
that underperformers will get severely beaten for missing
consensus, Pernod Ricard warned of slower growth, but overall
its results were seen as positive. Unilever Q3 sales were lower
than expected. Things are looking better for Ericsson which
posted results above forecast and SAP which raised guidance.

    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - There is around a 70 percent
chance that Britain and the European Union will reach a Brexit
deal at the last minute, credit agency Euler Hermes said on
Thursday.
    ""For companies that would be like a 'blind date' because
they wouldn't know what they've got coming,"" Ludovic Subran,
chief economist at Euler Hermes, said.
    ""The details could contain good or bad surprises but for
companies it would still be better than an ugly divorce,"" he
added.
    If a Brexit deal were reached, the exchange rate between the
British pound and the euro would probably climb to 1.14 after an
expected trough of between 1.06 and 1.09 by the end of 2018,
Euler Hermes said.
    It said it saw a 25 percent likelihood of Britain quitting
the bloc without a deal and said this would result in customs of
around 4 to 5 percent for both Britain and the EU as well as a
big depreciation in pound sterling - probably to 0.88 euros by
the end of 2019.
    That would cause a drop in exports, it said.
    Euler Hermes said uncertainty due to Brexit was likely to
shave up to 0.1 percentage points off British economic growth
every quarter until an agreement was reached.
    It said it was seeing signs of British companies
increasingly hoarding imported goods that were indispensable for
their production so they could avoid possible customs and delays
or disruptions to their supply chains.
    It said a hard Brexit - generally understood to mean Britain
distancing itself from the EU by leaving the single market and
the customs union - would have a huge economic impact, hurting
Britain the most while exports from Germany, the Netherlands,
France and Belgium would also suffer.
    There is a 5 percent chance of Britain remaining in the EU,
Euler Hermes said.

    VIENNA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Germany should push Bundesbank
chief Jens Weidmann as a successor to European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi and the government is making a grave
mistake in not pushing harder, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny
said on Thursday.
    Draghi's job will become available at the end of next
October. By that time Nowotny - the head of the Austrian
National Bank and a moderate policy hawk who has often sided
with Weidmann - will have left his post too.
    ""I would have welcomed a candidacy of Weidmann very much,""
Nowotny told the Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten newspaper."" I
personally believe it is a grave political mistake by (German
Chancellor) Angela Merkel that she is no longer pursuing
Weidmann's candidacy further.""
    Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau is now
considered the frontrunner in the race but no real discussion is
likely until after the European Parliament elections next
spring, when the ECB job is expected to  be decided in a package
that also includes the heads of the EU Commission and Council.
    Despite the political sensitivity of the race, Weidmann has
been outspoken in criticising the fiscal plans of Italy, the
euro zone's third biggest economy. He said on Wednesday that
monetary policy normalisation will place an increasing burden on
highly indebted countries so there is no place for leniency with
Rome on European fiscal rules. [nF9N1U500N]
    His repeated spats with Italy over fiscal prudence has
irritated political circles in Rome, making opposition to
Weidmann's candidacy almost certain.
    Weidmann, a top notch economist, has also come under fire
for his persistent opposition to the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro
asset purchase programme. 
    Unveiled during a period of crisis, the programme is
credited with reviving growth, and some argue that Weidmann
would struggle to unite the Governing Council after having
opposed its hallmark policy programme for so long. 
    ""It would be good if someone from the biggest economy in the
euro area stood at the top of the ECB,"" Nowotny told the paper,
adding that an ECB president needs political sensitivity and
practical experience as well as being a good economist.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Spanish bank shares fell sharply
on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruled that banks and not
clients must pay stamp duty related to mortgage loans
potentially costing lenders billions of euros in compensation. 
    ""The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,"" the court
said in a document.
    Spanish banks were severely hit after the 2008 property
crash which sent the economy in to a five-year downward spiral
and mortgages remain an important part on lenders' balance
sheets, especially those focused on the domestic market.
    After the court ruling, Bankia <BKIA.MC> fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Caixabank <CABK.MC>
fell 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.
    The decision is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders
after a European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that
banks had to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with
interest rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Bank of Spain initially said then that the lenders would
have to repay customers more than 4 billion euros ($4.6
billion)after Europe's top court overturned a previous Spanish
ruling that capped liabilities related to a disputed mortgage
clause.
    On Thursday, neither the Bank of Spain nor the Spanish
banking association AEB gave any estimates for potential costs
for Spanish lenders.
($1 = 0.8680 euros)

1568,3817,65d01be0b5cccf07d7532c6aa99f63c6,EU rejects U.S. calls to dilute derivatives clearing rules,2018-10-18 18:44:18,EUR,0,2018-10-18 18:44:25,"{'USD': 'Positive', 'EUR': 'Neutral', 'GBP': 'Neutral'}","    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union defended
proposed new derivatives clearing rules on Thursday after
criticism from the United States, saying the bloc has every
right to supervise foreign financial firms that serve EU
customers.
    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair
Christopher Giancarlo threatened retaliation on Wednesday unless
the EU watered down the draft rules, which set out tougher
conditions for foreign clearing houses doing business in the
bloc. [nL8N1WX2II]
    They include allowing EU regulators to directly supervise
foreign clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.
    For two regulators to air their differences so publicly is
rare.
    European Commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke said the
proposed EU regulations were actually based on existing U.S.
rules.
    ""It is the prerogative of the EU legislator to set the
general supervisory framework for central counterparties (CCPs)
active in the EU and we would expect third country authorities
to respect that, just as we respect the rules and legislative
procedures in other countries,"" Bahrke said in a statement.
    ""We reiterate that the cooperative oversight
we have proposed is modelled for systemically important
cross-border CCPs on the United States' own supervisory system,""
Bahrke said.
    The EU rules were drawn up in response to Britain's
departure from the bloc, which will result in Europe's biggest
clearing house for euro-denominated transactions like interest
rate swaps, London-based LCH <LSE.L>, being located outside the
bloc.
    Unless the Bank of England agrees to joint supervision of
LCH, the clearer may have to shift euro-denominated operations
to the EU or risk losing the business.
    The draft rules have led to accusations of regulatory
overreach in the United States, home to clearers like CME
<CME.O> and ICE <ICE.N>.
    Giancarlo said that unless the EU rules were watered down so
that the bloc's regulators ""defer"" to U.S. counterparts when it
comes to supervising American clearing houses, the CFTC could
effectively bar U.S. securities houses from trading on EU
exchanges. 
    Latest figures from the EU's securities watchdog ESMA on the
bloc's 660 trillion euro derivatives market, published on
Thursday, highlighted London's dominance in heavily traded
products like interest rate swaps.   
    Bahrke said the EU is globally the most open jurisdiction
when it comes to deferring to equivalent third country
regulators, and offers greater deference to the CFTC than vice
versa.
    ""The objective of the proposed new framework of CCP
supervision is to maintain that openness and adapt our
supervisory framework to the evolving circumstances in European
derivatives markets,"" Bahrke said. 
    ""We look forward to continuing the dialogue on this matter.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
discuss on Thursday how to make the euro zone more resilient to
crises, with the bloc's third biggest economy, Italy, putting
new urgency into the talks by challenging EU budget rules that
underpin the single currency.
    Leaders of all EU countries except Britain are to take stock
of progress in completing the euro zone's banking union and
granting new powers to its ESM bailout fund as the 19 countries
sharing the euro prepare for decisions to be taken in December. 
    ""We are ... looking for some guidance from leaders on topics
like the fiscal capacity,"" Mario Centeno, the chairman of euro
zone finance ministers, told reporters on entering the summit.
    ""I see growing interest in some member states in specific
issues related to the fiscal capacity, for example the
unemployment reinsurance system,"" he said.
    The reforms under consideration so far are to ensure that
the euro zone would have enough money in case of a major banking
crisis to resolve failing banks and to prevent bank runs by
setting up a euro zone-wide deposit guarantee scheme.
    The ESM is to get new powers of regularly monitoring
economies so that it could be ready at a moment's notice to step
in with a full bailout programme of reforms in exchange for
cheap loans if a sovereign were cut off from markets, possibly
after managing a debt restructuring if necessary.
    The fund is also to have the possibility of lending with
minimal conditions to euro zone governments that have been
conducting sound economic policy, but were hit by external
crises not of their own making.
    
    ITALY MAKES EURO ZONE REFORM MORE DIFFICULT
    But all these discussions, controversial from the start
because they involve sharing financial risks, have now been made
much more difficult by Italy, where a populist government wants
to finance higher spending and lower taxes with more borrowing.
    Italy has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe and
the highest debt servicing costs and because its economy grows
slowly, officials are concerned that more debt could trigger
another debt crisis like the one set of by Greece in 2010 that
nearly destroyed the euro zone.
    ""I am absolutely aware that the atmosphere is more tricky
than in June,"" the chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk said this
week when asked how Italy's fiscal plans would affect deeper
euro zone integration agreed on at a summit in June.
    ""But I think we can use the time before December to clarify
the position of some member states and our goal remains to have
visible progress in December,"" Tusk said.
    Privately, euro zone officials acknowledge that Rome's plans
only strengthened the opposition from those sceptical about
financial risk sharing.
    ""It is going to be more difficult now. At the moment when
you talk about deposit insurance the appetite for it is
smaller,"" one official involved in the talks said.
    ""Italy is now an additional argument not to even think about
it. And Germany, the Netherlands who have always said it is not
needed at all, of course they have now one argument more,"" he
said.
    Officials also worry that Italy may link its support for
whatever ideas are in the end agreed in the euro zone
integration process, with the EU's consent for its higher
borrowing in the 2019 budget.
    Under EU rules, highly indebted countries like Italy should
cut their deficit and debt every year, but Rome argues that the
higher borrowing would spur faster economic growth and debt
would fall as percentage of GDP in the end.
    The Commission rejects this, noting the resulting growth
would have to be very high for the argument to hold and that
borrowing more to reduce debt was not the way to go.
    ""If the confrontation intensifies, Italy can block any
consensus at the summit. That is a real risk,"" one official
said. ""That would not be the end of Europe, but it would be
disappointing because of all the work that has gone into this.""

    ROVINJ, Croatia, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Croatia's economy is
likely to expand less than 3 percent this year and next, and the
country may be hampered in future by growing competition to
attract tourists and investors and a shortage of workers as
young people move away, the central bank chief said on Thursday.
    Croatia has one of the slowest growth rates among its
emerging market peers in central and eastern Europe. Analysts
have warned for years that Zagreb must improve its business
climate to draw in more investment money.
    ""We see Croatia's growth rate at 2.7 percent this year and
at 2.8 percent in 2019,"" central bank governor Boris Vujcic told
an economic conference in the northern Adriatic resort of
Rovinj. Last year the economy grew 2.9 percent.
    Vujcic said that at the moment a key growth driver was
consumer spending, but he said there were several short-term and
longer-term risks facing the country. 
    They include external factors such as recoveries in tourism
in Mediterranean competitors like Greece, Turkey and Tunis, and
potential fiscal problems in Italy, one of Croatia's top three
trading partners.
    Tourism accounts for almost 20 percent of Croatia's economic
output.
    ""Rising trade protectionism measures globally are also a
potential risk. In the longer term, Croatia's aging population
combined with emigration of many young people to work in other
European Union countries is also a threat,"" Vujcic said.
    He said a later retirement age and drawing in foreign
workers were among the solutions for these problems.
    ""Unless we do something fairly quickly it will become a
serious problem for our growth prospects. By current estimates,
Croatia could see a reduction of its active population by
520,000 by 2040 - or some 20 percent,"" Vujcic said.
    Businesses often complain about too much red tape, a high
tax take, frequently changing regulations and a slow judiciary.
Without reforms, analysts say Croatia's longer-term growth may
be limited to 1-2 percent per year at best.
    Vujcic said average inflation was seen at 1.6 percent this
year, slowing down to 1.0 percent in 2019.

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The striking lack of financial
contagion across the euro zone from Italy's bond-market blowout
this year shows investors are breaking an eight-year habit of
lumping together the bonds of Italy, Spain and Portugal. 
    In an apparent vindication of European Central Bank efforts
to reduce spillover across the bloc each time one of the
southern European economies gets into trouble, the market has so
far treated the Italian budget dispute as a domestic storm. 
    For years after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis, Italy,
Spain and Portugal - collectively referred to as the ""periphery""
by bond investors - saw their bonds track each other. 
    Anything that risked a repeat of the euro zone's existential
angst six years ago tarred all the weaker credits with the same
brush. 

    Yet six years after ECB chief Mario Draghi pledged to do
""whatever it takes"" to save the euro zone, the correlation is
fading. 
    An uproar over Italy's budget deficit and risks of a clash
between Rome and European Union authorities have barely touched
Portuguese and Spanish debt. Such has been the divergence that
the premium demanded by investors to hold Italian risk over
Spain's hit its widest in over 20 years.
    ""We are very close to record low levels in terms of
correlation between peripheral countries, and it's very clear
that from the market perspective for the first time in a while a
major euro zone bond market incident is not being seen as a
threat to the euro system,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, a global
strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. 
    One reason is that the budget concerns are so far confined
to Italy. But idiosyncratic risks have in the past spread across
southern European bond markets too -- one example being the
approach to the Catalan independence referendum last year.      
  
    Confidence is higher this time that the Italian debt problem
will not threaten the country's euro membership. The country's
anti-establishment coalition government has been at pains to
stress it has no interest in exiting the zone. 
    Contagion would return only if the euro's future is in
danger, said Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP
Paribas Asset Management.  
    Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JPMorgan
Asset Management, said the fund he oversees has been buying
Spanish government debt through the recent Italian ruckus. 
    ""If you're a fund manager and you don't want to own Italy,
Spain and Portugal are the only realistic alternatives,"" he told
Reuters. 
    ""Spain has been the poster child for European growth in
recent years - if you think about 2012, where unemployment rates
were, how strong concerns were over the banking system in the
periphery, we are in a very different place now,"" he said.     
    
    Spain has led the euro zone economic recovery in 2016 and
2017, growing more than 3 percent a year and earning multiple
credit ratings upgrades to Baa1 from Moody's and A- from both
S&P Global and Fitch.
    Portugal, not long ago rated junk by all three major
agencies, last week was restored to full investment-grade status
after a Moody's upgrade. Its economy grew 2.7 percent in 2017,
outperforming the euro zone [nL8N1WV2M7].
    Both countries have benefited from their share of the ECB's
2.6 trillion-euro ($3 trillion) stimulus programme.
    But even countries partly or fully outside the ECB programme
have felt its effect. Cyprus recorded stellar growth of 3.9
percent last year and Greece exited its bailout programme in
August. 
    This week, Greece said it achieved a primary budget surplus
well above target for the year so far [nL8N1WV4KI].   
     
    ""The type of investors invested in Spain and Portugal is not
the same as it was before,"" said BBVA rates trading strategist
Jaime Costero Denche. ""We have seen new investors such as
Scandinavian accounts and Middle East and Asian investors who
didn't want to buy peripheral debt in the past."" 
    A major factor limiting contagion from Italy is that
Portuguese and Spanish banks are in better shape, thanks to
authorities' success in tackling bad loans -- a road Italy
embarked on only recently.
    Portuguese banks have mostly returned to profit. In June,
Moody's lifted its outlook for Spain's banking system to
positive. It cited robust economic growth and improved asset
quality after disposals of troubled assets.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A dispute over Italy's
proposed budget is expected to have little effect on the euro
zone, the deputy governor of Slovenia's central bank told
Reuters on Thursday.
    The European Commission says the Italy's proposed budget
would push up Italy's public debt, which is already around 130
percent of GDP, the highest in the euro zone after Greece
[nL8N1WV1L6].
    Italian government bond yields have climbed since the budget
was proposed, partly on concern the Commission would reject it -
an unprecedented move [nNRA7569lz]. But so far the row over
Italy has not spilled over into other euro zone bond markets
[nL8N1WS26W].
    ""Potentially the influence could be big if that would spread
over Europe, but I expect de facto influence will be small or
negligible,"" Bank of Slovenia Deputy Governor Primoz Dolenc said
on the sidelines of a banking conference. 
    He also said the European Central Bank is preparing for all
possibilities regarding Britain's exit from the European Union. 
So far, the EU and Britain have reached no agreement on the
terms of Britain's departure, which is due to take place in less
than six months [nL8N1WY1X5].
    Asked about the possibility Britain would leave without an
agreement, Dolenc said: ""It is hard to comment what the
influence would be on the monetary policy or the duties of ECB.
ECB is preparing on all scenarios and we will be ready whatever
happens.""
    He said he expected ECB interest rates to remain low 
through the summer of 2019. ""Interest rates will be low for a
long time still, probably through the summer of 2019.""
    Dolenc has led the Bank of Slovenia since former governor
Bostjan Jazbec resigned in April to take a position on the EU's
Single Resolution Board.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Spanish bank shares fell sharply
on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruled banks must pay stamp
duty on mortgage loans, potentially costing them billions of
euros in compensation and raising pressure on their lending
business.  
    ""The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,"" the court
said in a document.
    The Supreme court ruling, which overturned a previous ruling
from earlier this year, is now final and could leave banks
potentially exposed to additional legal provisions, analysts
said.
    Spanish banks were severely hit after the 2008 property
crash which sent the economy in to a five-year downward spiral
and mortgages remain an important part on lenders' balance
sheets, especially those focused on the domestic market.
    After the court ruling, Bankia <BKIA.MC> fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Caixabank <CABK.MC>
fell 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.
    Other smaller Spanish lenders focused in Spain, such as
former regional savings banks Liberbank <LBK.MC> and Unicaja
<UNI.MC>, were also among the most severely hit, with declines
as high as 8 percent and 7 percent.
    BBVA <BBVA.MC>, Bankinter <BKT.MC> and Banco Santander
<SAN.MC> also fell between 1.5 percent and 6.4 percent.
    The ruling comes at a sensitive moment for Spanish banks as
they struggle to glean earnings from loans with interest rates
at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins.
    The decision is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders
after a European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that
banks had to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with
interest rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Bank of Spain initially said then that the lenders would
have to repay customers more than 4 billion euros ($4.60
billion) after Europe's top court overturned a previous Spanish
ruling that capped liabilities related to a disputed mortgage
clause.
    On Thursday, the Bank of Spain did not give any estimates
for potential costs for Spanish lenders.
    The Spanish banking association AEB said the ruling referred
to a tax issue and that lenders had not received any amount from
their clients for this concept. It also demanded greater legal
security and predictable rules for the mortgage market.
    The AEB said based on this ruling, banks would comply from
now on with the new criteria established by the Supreme Court.
    Analysts said it would be difficult to calculate the amount
of the cost of this sentence because, among other things, stamp
duty varies depending on the different autonomous regions.
    Spanish consumer association Adicae said that up to 8
million clients could be affected by the court ruling.
    Though the ruling does not state from when clients are
entitled to be compensated, the Spanish legal systems allows
customers to potentially reclaim any compensation from tax
authorities for cases going back four years.
    Spanish banks could end up paying anything between 1.7
billion euros and 10 billion euros in compensation, according to
analysts.

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - With five months to
go, Prime Minister Theresa May still can’t come up with a plan
that satisfies the European Union and hard-line
parliamentarians. To avoid a chaotic Brexit, at least one side
must cave. That won’t happen until the disastrous alternative
gets even closer.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Prime Minister Theresa May on Oct. 18 signalled she would
consider extending a so-called transition period “for a matter
of months” after Britain leaves the European Union.
    - With less than six months before Britain is due to quit
the EU, talks have stalled over how to deal with the border
between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
    - At an EU summit in Brussels on Oct. 17, several leaders
and diplomats said May had offered nothing new to strike the
kind of breakthrough needed to move forward.
    - EU negotiators are insisting that Britain commit to keep
Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union -
thereby avoiding a hard border with Ireland - if no other
agreement can be reached. Negotiations about a broader trade
agreement would only begin in earnest after Britain formally
leaves the bloc in March 2019. These talks would take place
during an “implementation period” which is due to end in
December 2020.
    - “A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at
this stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation
period for a matter of months, and it would only be a matter of
months,” May told reporters on the second day of the summit.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte presented his country's 2019 draft budget to EU leaders in
Brussels on Thursday, but the summit did not discuss it in any
detail, the head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker
said.
     ""The Italian Prime Minister presented the Italian situation
to us, with big talent and in a very clear way, and we did not
ask him about it because (the Commission) is currently examining
the draft budget as sent to us by the Italian authorities,""
Juncker told a news conference.
    ""We have no negative prejudice against the Italian budget,""
Juncker said.
    Italy's populist government wants to finance higher spending
and lower taxes with more borrowing and presented a draft 2019
budget to the European Commission on Monday with a deficit three
times as high as the one the EU agreed with the previous
government in Rome.
    Italy has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe and
the highest debt servicing costs and because its economy grows
slowly, officials are concerned that more debt could trigger
another debt crisis like the one set off by Greece in 2010 that
nearly destroyed the euro zone.
    ""We did not discuss the Italian draft budget in detail, that
was not the meeting to doing so, but I know from the past that
the Commission has always been accused of being too generous
when it came to Italian budgets,"" Juncker said.
    He noted that Italy has been the only euro zone country to
have used every possibility to spend more money under EU rules,
called the Stability and Growth Pact, which allowed it to spend
30 billion euros more in the last three years without sanctions.
    ""I had some colleagues (EU leaders) on the phone, they don't
want us to add flexibility to already existing flexibility and
that is not our intention,"" Juncker said.
    ""We were very kind, gentle and positive when it came to
Italy. Because Italy is Italy,"" he said, in a reference to a
similar remark he made about France when justifying the
Commission's green light for extra spending by Paris in the
past.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's 2019 budget draft is in
serious breach of EU budget rules, the European Commission told
Rome on Thursday, in a step that prepares the ground for what
would be an unprecedented rejection of a member state's fiscal
plan.
    The Commission said in a letter to Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria, published on its website, that planned government spending
was too high, the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and
business cycle effects - would rise instead of fall, and that
Italian public debt would not fall in line with EU rules.
    ""Those three factors would seem to point to a particularly
serious non-compliance with the budgetary policy obligations
laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact,"" the letter said. 
    The Commission said that the draft budget envisaged a
nominal rate of growth of net government expenditure next year
of 2.7 percent, while EU rules allowed Italy only 0.1 percent.
    The structural deficit would rise 0.8 percent of GDP next
year, while a binding recommendation by EU finance ministers
from July obliged Rome to cut it by 0.6 percent of GDP.
    ""Moreover, with Italy's government debt standing at around
130 percent of GDP, our preliminary assessment also indicates
that Italy's plans would not ensure compliance with the debt
criterion benchmark ... which requires a steady reduction of the
debt level towards the 60 percent threshold,"" the letter said.
    The Commission also asked Tria to explain why he ignored a
negative opinion on the budget's macroeconomic assumptions from
the Parliamentary Budget Office - Italy's independent fiscal
monitoring institution - which also violates EU law.
    The Commission asked Rome to respond by Monday.
    The letter is part of required consultations between the
Commission and any euro zone government whose draft budget
clearly breaks EU rules.
    Unless the main parameters of the budget are changed, the 
Commission is likely to send the draft back to authorities in
Rome asking for changes for the first time since it got
draft-budget vetting powers in 2013.

stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff edge
if Britain leaves the bloc with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be published in the coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks have called for regulators to take preventive action
to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives contracts if
there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern that has emerged, but the
private sector could take action to mitigate risks, such as
shifting contracts from London to the EU before March.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Dombrovskis said he would be following up on the central
banks' initial findings to see if any regulatory action was
needed by the EU.
    ""There is no cliff edge,"" Olivier Guersent, Dombrovskis' top
civil servant added.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union rejected U.S.
calls to water down new  derivatives clearing rules on Thursday,
saying EU lawmakers would not be ""blackmailed"" and it had every
right to supervise foreign financial firms in the same way as
U.S. regulators.
    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair
Christopher Giancarlo threatened retaliation on Wednesday unless
the EU softened the draft rules, which set out tougher
conditions for foreign clearing houses doing business in the
bloc. [nL8N1WX2II]
    They include allowing EU regulators to directly supervise
clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.
    For two regulators to air their differences so publicly is
rare.
    Asked if the bloc would weaken the rules, EU financial
services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said they were similar to how
the United States supervises foreign financial firms that serve
U.S. customers.
    ""Our system would become more similar to the U.S. system.
It's a balanced approach,"" Dombrovskis said.
    The EU was not calling into question its existing agreement
with the United States on recognising each other's derivatives
clearing rules, he said.
    Dombrovskis' top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, told the
Politico event that it was unfortunate that ""my friend Mr
Giancarlo is blackmailing legislators"".
    When the United States threatened to cut off U.S. market
access for EU financial firms, it would change nothing. ""I don't
like it but that is their right,"" Guersent said.
    The EU rules were drawn up in response to Brexit, which will
result in Europe's biggest clearing house for euro-denominated
transactions like interest rate swaps, London-based LCH <LSE.L>,
being located outside the bloc.
    Unless the Bank of England agrees to joint supervision of
LCH, the clearer may have to shift euro-denominated operations
to the EU or risk losing the business.
    The draft rules have led to accusations of regulatory
overreach in the United States, home to clearers like CME
<CME.O> and ICE <ICE.N>.
    Giancarlo said that unless the EU rules were watered down so
that the bloc's regulators ""defer"" to U.S. counterparts when it
comes to supervising American clearing houses, the CFTC could
effectively bar U.S. securities houses from trading on EU
exchanges. 
    Latest figures from the EU's securities watchdog ESMA on the
bloc's 660 trillion euro derivatives market, published on
Thursday, highlighted London's dominance in heavily traded
products like interest rate swaps.   
    The European Commission said it offers greater deference to
the CFTC than vice versa.
    ""The objective of the proposed new framework of CCP
supervision is to ...adapt our supervisory framework to the
evolving circumstances in European derivatives markets,"" a
Commission spokesman said. 
    ""We look forward to continuing the dialogue on this matter.""

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A report on risks to the
stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff if
Britain leaves the EU with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be published in coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks and the BoE have called on Brussels to take preventive
action to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives
contracts if there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern, but the private sector could
take action to mitigate risks, such as shifting contracts from
London to the EU before March.
    Once the interim report is published, ""we can see what
concrete steps are necessary, whether there are also some
regulatory steps that are necessary,"" Dombrovskis said.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Asked about concerns over derivatives in a no-deal Brexit,
Dombrovskis' top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, said: ""There
is no cliff.""
    ""On 30th of March... nothing happens,"" Guersent said, adding
that contracts would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
    But banks say Brussels is slow to deal with potential
contract disruption in order to pile pressure on them to staff
new hubs in the EU before March and shift the contracts to them.
    Mark Hoban, head of the IRSG, a financial services think
tank backed by the financial sector, said the sector was waiting
for regulators in Britain and the EU to sign cooperation
agreements to deal with potential disruption to contracts.
    ""My suspicion is that you have got MOUs stuck in desk
drawers on both sides of the Channel. What the regulators are
waiting for is the green light from the Commission that allows
conversations to happen.""
    Giving the green light would give markets more confidence
about Brexit Day, but instead there is unhelpful brinkmanship,
Hoban said.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - European leaders wind down their
talks in Brussels today by meeting their Asian counterparts in
an EU-Asia summit intended to show multilateral cooperation
still lives on in the Trump era. Everything from trade to
climate change will be on the agenda, as will the signing of a
much-delayed EU-Singapore trade pact. On the Brexit stand-off,
the EU is for now choosing to wax optimistic about the chances
of a deal while making clear that it is now entirely up to
Theresa May to bring her government round to the compromise
close to being clinched last weekend.
    May's finance minister Philip Hammond will meanwhile be
hoping that public finance figures for September due for release
today contain no nasty surprises ahead of his Oct. 30 budget,
where he is under pressure to deliver spending hikes in areas
such as health. August's deficit came in well above expectations
on a combination of subdued tax receipts, a rise in the state
pension and higher EU budget payments. Voter support for higher
spending on Britain's battered public services is rising:
Hammond's boss May believes the government must respond to
ensure opposition Labour do not capitalise.
    Poland holds local elections on Sunday that will be an
interesting midterm test of the popularity of the Law and
Justice (PiS) party and its mix of social conservatism,
nationalism and voter-pleasing welfare benefit policies. Much of
the focus will be on the capital Warsaw and whether the PiS
candidate can beat the centrist favourite in what has long been
a stronghold for the rival Civic Platform (PO). That would be a
major upset suggesting that PiS' brand of populism works with
urban voters too.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    Another day, another dollop of bad news. After sharp drops
last night on Wall Street and a fresh blowout in Italian bond
yields, this morning has been dominated by data showing China's
Q3 economic growth was the weakest since 2009, dragged down by
weak industrial output including a 10 percent fall in car output
in September. But pledges of support from regulators and PBOC
governor Yi Gang have stabilised local equity markets, and in
fact Shanghai and Shenzen have jumped almost 3 percent though
they are down around 30 percent this year. But the prospect of
stimulus is likely to pressure the yuan further; offshore yuan
touched two-month lows yesterday. And the data dampened the mood
right across Asia with Japan, Australia and Korean stocks all
taking a hit before tracking the Chinese markets.
    In Europe, shares are set to open marginally lower, with the
China-exposed DAX likely to see the most pain. All that is just
convincing more people that the stock market bull is being kept
alive merely with the glucose injections provided by US tax
cuts. That is expected to allow for 20 percent plus earnings
growth in the US this quarter. However, there was already some
disappointment last night from industrials, while tech stocks
fell 2 percent. Later today we have earnings from Honeywell as
well as State Street and Proctor and Gamble, the latter showing
how consumer goods demand is holding up in the developing world
too. 
     World stocks are set for their fourth straight week of
losses, their longest losing streak since 2015, though the
S&P500 will likely snap a three-week losing streak. While all
the nerves have dampened yields of safe Bunds and Treasuries,
there could be fresh concerns about Europe where the European
Commission called Italy’s 2019 budget ""particularly serious
non-compliance"" with EU rules, setting the stage for an
unprecedented rejection of the country's fiscal plan. Italian
yields this morning are up 5 bps after they spiked yesterday to
5-1/2 year highs, and this morning, money markets have cut back
expectations of an ECB rate rise in September 2019, and are now
fully pricing a rate rise only in October. Clearly, markets are
expecting the Italy woes to impact the ECB decision.
    On currency markets, eyes are likely to be on the yuan which
is fast heading towards the 7 per dollar mark. The euro too is
likely to come under pressure from the Italy issues, having hit
a 10-day low versus the dollar on Thursday. But emerging
currencies are set for their second straight week of gains
according to an MSCI index. Sterling is a touch higher after the
EU’s Barnier said a deal was 90 percent done - even though he
added that the Irish border issue could still derail it. 
    European stocks opened slightly lower after a sharp fall on
Thursday as Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are
bad news for Germany’s stock market which is the most reliant on
the world’s second largest economy. DAX is just in the red.
Rhetoric between European Commission and Italian government
ramps up over the budget. Some recurring themes were emerging
from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in China,
issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing
regulations weighing on autos. Tyre maker Michelin blamed
slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth
forecasts for tyre demand. The stock was indicated down 5 to 7
percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to
“difficulties” in its construction businesses, and traders saw
the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. Sweden’s Volvo was the
outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly
profit expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and
construction equipment and forecasting high demand in its main
markets of Europe and North America in 2019. M&A could also be a
driver for UK retail property developer Intu which confirmed on
Friday it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium
formed by British billionaire John Whittaker and Saudi Arabian
and Canadian investors. One trading desk saw the shares rising 8
percent. 
    In company news and potential stock movers: Software AG in
slight Q3 beat as industrial internet unit ramps up; Casino
confident on disposal plan, Q3 sales accelerate; VW's Porsche
expects to repeat record vehicle sales this year; France's
Bouygues cuts 2018 profit forecast; AccorHotels raises earnings

    Emerging market stocks are down the a fourth straight week.

central bank governor was going to step down.  Turkish Lira

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month
low on Friday after the European Union criticized Italy's
spending plans, raising fresh concern over conflict within the
common currency zone.
    Political wrangling over the budget in heavily indebted
Italy has seen the euro weaken over 1 percent versus the dollar
this week.
    In the first step of a procedure that could end with
Brussels rejecting the budget and fining Italy, the Commission
sent Rome a letter on Thursday calling a draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules [nL8N1WY6JF].     
    The single currency fell to an intra-day low of $1.1433
<EUR=EBS> close to a two-month low of $1.1432 hit on October 9.
    Italy is the third-largest economy of the 19-country euro
zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.
    The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields
reached its widest in 5 1/2 years after news of the Commission
letter broke [nL8N1WY5V7].
    ""The euro is already suffering considerably now, and that
would be worse if the crisis really gets going, [especially] as
the dollar is now providing attractive yields,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP yields moved notably
higher ""correlations could well strengthen and this would
provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the
tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the
European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.
    Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an
interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this
week, they were projecting an increase next
September[nL8N1WZ1A9]. 
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against major
peers, was 0.2 percent higher at 96.091 on Friday, close to a
two-month high of 96.155. The rise was driven by Thursday's
decline by the euro, which accounts for 57 percent of the index.
    Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel
Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90
percent done but that hurdles remained [nL8N1WZ1DC].
    Sterling rose to a day's high versus the dollar of $1.3038
<GBP=D3>, trading broadly flat. It also strengthened 0.1 percent
against the euro to 87.9 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    The Japanese yen <JPY=D3> weakened 0.23 percent versus the
dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.48.
    A global risk-off mood has prevailed this week amid tension
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy's budget woes and
U.S-Sino trade conflict.
    China's economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5
percent, its weakest since 2009 and below expectations, as a
campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States weighed on the economy [nL4N1WQ2N8].
    The yuan <CNY=D3> changed hands at 6.9420 on Friday, trading
down 0.1 percent versus the dollar, close to a two-month low. 
    ""Expectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to
depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,""
said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
hit four-year highs on Friday, extending their rise after the
European Union slammed Rome's draft budget, while money markets
were betting that the EU-Italy tug-of-war could force the ECB to
delay its first rate rise.
    German government bonds, seen as a safe asset in the euro
zone, rallied. But Portuguese and Spanish bonds, resilient so
far through the Italian budget debacle, also sold off, with some
analysts suggesting this was the first sign of contagion from
Italy. 
    Italy's Prime Minister defended the free-spending budget on
Thursday, brushing off criticism from Brussels as the European
Commission stepped up pressure over a draft it labelled an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules. [nL8N1WY213]    
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the
month. [nL8N1WY4UV]    
    While it is not unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of the budget, the sending of the
formal letter and the tone of the comments were particularly
strong, analysts said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid told clients. 
    ""The next week will likely see things escalate further given
these tensions, an ECB meeting where little sympathy is likely
to be given, and also the upcoming rating agency actions,"" he
added.  
    S&P Global is due to review Italy's rating next Friday,
October 26, while Moody's said it would likely complete a review
of Italy's rating at the end of October.
    A downgrade would put Italy a notch away from junk status
and the potential loss of hundreds of billions of fund flows
that go with an investment grade rating.     
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent,
the highest since February 2014. <IT10YT=RR>     
    The 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at 332 basis
points, just below a 5-1/2 year high hit on Thursday.
<DE10IT10=RR> [nL8N1WY5V7]  
    Italy's 30-year bond yield hit a 4-1/2 year high of 4.22 pct
before dropping to 4.09 percent, still up two bps on the day and
adding to a 20 bps increase over Wednesday and Thursday.
<IT30YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, euro zone money markets are starting to push back
the timing of a European Central Bank's first interest rate rise
to  October 2019.
    Having fully priced a September 2019 hike as recently as
Monday, money markets now suggest just a 75 percent chance of a
10 bps ECB rate hike in September 2019 and fully price a hike in
October <ECBWATCH>, a bet that a tussle between Italy and EU may
force the ECB to be more cautious in removing stimulus. 
    The budget wrangling has put a lid on the euro's recent
revival. The single currency on Friday fell towards a two-month
low of $1.14325 <EUR=EBS> and has weakened over one percent this
week.
    The Italian selloff drove investors into German government
bonds with yields briefly touching 0.407 percent, the lowest in
over a month. German yields are now around 16 bps below this
month's peak. <DE10YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year government bond
yields rose 3-4 basis points each to hit a fresh one-year high
of 1.77 percent and a five-month high of 2.08 percent
respectively. <ES10YT=RR>, <PT10YT=RR> 
    Commerzbank strategists flagged the rise in Spanish yields
as a sign of contagion from Italy, calling it ""textbook crisis
dynamics"" in a note.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The current account surplus of
the 19 countries sharing the euro widened to 24 billion euros in
August from 19 billion euros the previous month as the trade
surplus also increased, the European Central Bank said on
Friday.
    In the 12 months to August, the surplus widened to 3.3
percent of the bloc's gross domestic product from 3.0 percent in
the preceding 12-month period, primarily on a surge in the
surplus on services.
    The surplus, often criticised by the U.S. administration as
excessive, is expected to narrow to 2.8 percent of GDP next year
but may then hold at that level in 2020, according to ECB
projections.

Lengthy procedures mean the spat will drag on until European

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government is trying a risky gamble. Its promise to boost
spending has triggered a clash with the European Commission.
Lengthy procedures mean the spat could drag on until European
Parliament elections in May. With radical parties gaining
ground, the next Commission may be more lenient or weaker. But
intense market pressure could spoil the plan.
    Rome’s EU-sceptic coalition partners – the 5-Star Movement
and the League – want to boost the budget deficit to 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2019 to fulfil expensive electoral promises. That’s
below an EU’s self-imposed cap of 3 percent but above the 1.8
percent deficit target this year. And it breaches EU rules that
require countries to cut their deficit to lower debt,
particularly when, like Italy, their borrowing is as high as 131
percent of GDP.
    Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, engaged in an
escalating slanging match with Italian leaders, wants budget
changes, and could open an excessive deficit procedure, a
process that can lead to fines. Such threats could fall on deaf
ears in Italy. Italy’s spending plans are popular with voters,
while the EU is not. Only 44 percent of Italians in an October
Eurobarometer poll backed the union, the lowest proportion of
any EU country. 
    Rome knows that a formal EU censure would take time. Italy
has until December to approve its budget. And the Commission
would be unwise to act before April, when it might have data
showing Italy’s debt will not fall. That’s just a month before
EU voters choose the next Parliament, which will approve
Juncker’s successor, and vet commissioners. Rising support for
anti-EU movements means mainstream conservative and socialist
parties will not be able to control the assembly. The new
executive would reflect a more fragmented and radical political
landscape, and could turn out to be less rigid than the present
one, or weaker.  
    While the EU process is lengthy, bond markets’ judgment can
be swift. Interest rates on Italy's 10-year sovereign debt have
risen to a four-year peak of 4.2 percent. The turmoil could hit
the economy, and trigger banks’ insolvencies. It could also
strain the bickering coalition and prompt a government collapse.
Italy’s budget gamble is already backfiring.

the statistics office said on Friday, citing the forecast of the

    The surplus will be larger than the finance ministry
forecast a year ago, when it was projected at 0.4 percent of
GDP.
    The office also said public debt will increase to 32.1

growth will decrease it as a percentage of GDP. It will reach
70.3 percent of GDP this year versus 74.1 percent last year.
    Slovenia, which narrowly avoided an international bailout of
its banks in 2013, returned to growth a year later. A robust
expansion, based on exports, investments and household spending,
enabled it to erase budget deficits and reduce debt.
    Finance Minister Andrej Bertoncelj said last week the
country expects a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2019 and debt
is due to fall to 66.6 percent of GDP, mainly because of
economic growth [nL8N1WR47N].
    The government expects the economy to expand by 3.7 percent
in 2019 versus 4.4 percent this year [nL8N1WD3MO].

    * Builds stake in LCH to more than 80 percent
    * Plays down threat of losing business over Brexit 

    By Arathy S Nair and Huw Jones
    Oct 19 (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange <LSE.L>
tightened its grip on derivatives clearing on Friday in a sign
of growing confidence that the threat of losing chunks of
business to European Union rivals after Brexit was receding.
    In the first major move by the exchange's new chief
executive David Schwimmer, the former Goldman Sachs banker who
took the reins in August, the LSE said it was spending 438
million euros ($501 million) on increasing its stake in LCH by
15.1 percent to over 80 percent.
    The transaction, which will be funded from cash and existing
debt facilities, will add to earnings per share following
completion, expected before the end of 2018, LSE said. 
    ""This reflects our confidence in LCH for continued growth,""
the exchange's chief financial officer, David Warren told an
analyst conference call.
    LSE shares were up 0.9 percent at 4,324 pence at 0900 GMT,
bucking a weaker trend in the broader stock market.
    LCH is one of the world's top clearing houses for
derivatives, but its dominance in euro denominated transactions
has led to calls for that activity to be relocated to the single
currency area after Brexit.
    LCH also faces the threat of being locked out of the EU
market when Britain leaves the bloc next March if a no-deal
Brexit puts the legality of cross-border derivatives contracts
into question.
    Warren, however, said he was encouraged by recent meetings
with regulators and central bankers who are looking at potential
disruption to so-called contract continuity.
    ""We think there is a new urgency about getting solutions and
legal certainty in the very near future, and it's very clear our
customers want continuity of service,"" he said.
    A working group lead by the European Central Bank and Bank
of England on market risks from Brexit is due to report its
initial findings in coming days. [nL8N1WY722]
    
    EUROPEAN OPERATIONS
    The LSE has a clearing unit in Paris, but Warren said
customers don't want the exchange to apply for a licence there
to handle the euro clearing currently being done in London.
    LCH would need to serve notice on EU customers by December
if it felt it could not continue clearing their transactions in
London after Brexit, but exchange officials said on Friday they
have no plans to do this in a further sign that the threat of
disruption has receded.
    Rival Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> in Frankfurt is stepping up
efforts to attract LCH business from London but volume so far is
small.
    Warren played down the threat, saying euro-denominated
business transacted by EU customers accounted for just 7-14
percent of LCH overall activity.
    Nevertheless, the LSE, which also owns the Milan Exchange,
has applied for a licence in Amsterdam to operate its Turquoise
pan-European share trading service.
    The LSE said that total income from continuing operations
rose 8 percent to 522 million pounds in the quarter ended Sept.
30, below analysts' estimates of 530 million pounds.
    Warren said an accounting rule change dampened revenue and
income figures in the exchange's capital markets unit.
 ($1 = 0.7686 pounds)
 ($1 = 0.8735 euros)

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
hit 4 1/2-year highs on Friday  after the European Union slammed
Rome's draft budget, while money markets bet that the EU-Italy
tug-of-war could force the European Central Bank to delay its
first rate rise.
    German government bonds, considered a safe asset in the euro
zone, rallied. But Portuguese and Spanish bonds, resilient so
far through the Italian budget debacle, sold off, with some
analysts suggesting this was the first sign of contagion from
Italy. 
    Italy's Prime Minister defended the free-spending budget on
Thursday, brushing off criticism from Brussels as the European
Commission stepped up pressure over a draft it labelled an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules [nL8N1WY213].    
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the month
[nL8N1WY4UV].    
    While it is not unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of the budget, a formal letter and
the tone of the comments were particularly strong, analysts
said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid told clients. 
    ""The next week will likely see things escalate further given
these tensions, an ECB meeting where little sympathy is likely
to be given, and also the upcoming rating agency actions,"" he
added.  
    S&P Global is due to review Italy's rating next Friday,
October 26 and Moody's is expected to complete a review of
Italy's rating by the end of October.
    A downgrade would put Italy a notch away from junk status
and the potential loss of hundreds of billions of funds that go
with an investment grade rating [nL8N1WP4QO].
    Reports of a disagreement within the Italian coalition also
hurt the country's bond market. Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would halt an electoral tour in
northern Italy and return to Rome to settle a row within the
government over a tax amnesty [nR1N1W5003].
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose nearly 10 basis
points to 3.77 percent, the highest since February 2014, while
two-year yields were up 11 bps at 1.93 percent. <IT10YT=RR>     
    The 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at 338 bps, a
fresh 5-1/2 year high. <DE10IT10=RR>     
    Italy's 30-year bond yield hit a 4 1/2-year high of 4.22 pct
before dropping to 4.12 percent, still up five bps on the day
and adding to a 20-bps increase over Wednesday and Thursday.
<IT30YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, trade in euro zone money markets suggested
investors were starting to push back expectations for the timing
of an ECB rate rise to October 2019.
    Having fully priced in a September 2019 hike as recently as
Monday, money markets now suggest just a 75 percent chance of a
10 bps rise then <ECBWATCH>, a sign that turmoil in Italy is
forcing a more cautious stance from the ECB.
    The budget wrangling has put a lid on the euro's recent
revival. The single currency on Friday fell towards a two-month
low of $1.14325 <EUR=EBS> and has weakened over one percent this
week.
    But safe-haven German government bonds gained, with 10-year
yields touching a one-month low of 0.39 percent and two-year
yields a two-month low of minus 0.67 percent. German yields are
now around 16 bps below this month's peak. <DE10YT=RR>
<DE2YT=RR>         
    Spanish and Portuguese 10-year government bond yields rose 7
to 8 basis points each to a one-year high of 1.82 percent and a
five-month high of 2.11 percent respectively. <ES10YT=RR>,
<PT10YT=RR> 
    Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger flagged the rise in
Spanish yields as a sign of contagion from Italy, though he said
issues around the Spanish budget also contributed [nL8N1WR24E].

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    EARLY MORNING HEADLINE ROUND-UP: CHINA, CONSTRUCTION, AUTOS IN FOCUS (0546 GMT)
    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government is trying a risky gamble. Its promise to boost
spending has triggered a clash with the European Commission.
Lengthy procedures mean the spat could drag on until European
Parliament elections in May. With radical parties gaining
ground, the next Commission may be more lenient or weaker. But
intense market pressure could spoil the plan.
    Rome’s EU-sceptic coalition partners – the 5-Star Movement
and the League – want to boost the budget deficit to 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2019 to fulfil expensive electoral promises. That’s
below an EU’s self-imposed cap of 3 percent but above the 1.8
percent deficit target this year. And it breaches EU rules that
require countries to cut their deficit to lower debt,
particularly when, like Italy, their borrowing is as high as 131
percent of GDP.
    Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, engaged in an
escalating slanging match with Italian leaders, wants budget
changes, and could open an excessive deficit procedure, a
process that can lead to fines. Such threats could fall on deaf
ears in Italy. Italy’s spending plans are popular with voters,
while the EU is not. Only 44 percent of Italians in an October
Eurobarometer poll backed the union, the lowest proportion of
any EU country. 
    Rome knows that a formal EU censure would take time. Italy
has until December to approve its budget. And the Commission
would be unwise to act before April, when it might have data
showing Italy’s debt will not fall. That’s just a month before
EU voters choose the next Parliament, which will approve
Juncker’s successor, and vet commissioners. Rising support for
anti-EU movements means mainstream conservative and socialist
parties will not be able to control the assembly. The new
executive would reflect a more fragmented and radical political
landscape, and could turn out to be less rigid than the present
one, or weaker.  
    While the EU process is lengthy, bond markets’ judgment can
be swift. Interest rates on Italy's 10-year sovereign debt have
risen to a four-year peak of 4.2 percent. The turmoil could hit
the economy, and trigger banks’ insolvencies. It could also
strain the bickering coalition and prompt a government collapse.
Italy’s budget gamble is already backfiring.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Oct. 18 his
coalition government would move ahead with a planned
expansionary budget despite criticism from the European
Commission and the risk of fines for breaching euro zone fiscal
rules.
    - Italy is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
in 2019 to finance measures including wider unemployment
benefits and an early retirement scheme, up from a target
deficit of 1.8 percent this year. The budget contravenes EU
rules that require Italy and other indebted countries to
steadily narrow the fiscal deficit to zero.
    - The European Commission said the budget plans would
constitute an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules in a
letter to Rome on Oct. 18. The Commission has the power to
launch a so-called excessive deficit procedure against Italy
that could ultimately lead to a fine.
    - Italy’s public debt stood at around 131 percent of GDP in
2017, the second-highest as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone
after Greece.
    - Italian 10-year government bond yields rose to 4.2 percent
in early morning trading on Oct. 19, the highest level in
four-and-a-half years.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
hit 4 1/2-year highs on Friday  after the European Union slammed
Rome's draft budget, while money markets bet that the EU-Italy
tug-of-war could force the European Central Bank to delay its
first rate rise.
    German government bonds, considered a safe asset in the euro
zone, rallied. But Portuguese and Spanish bonds, resilient so
far through the Italian budget debacle, sold off, with some
analysts suggesting this was the first sign of contagion from
Italy. 
    Italy's Prime Minister defended the free-spending budget on
Thursday, brushing off criticism from Brussels as the European
Commission stepped up pressure over a draft it labelled an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules [nL8N1WY213].    
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the month
[nL8N1WY4UV].    
    While it is not unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of the budget, a formal letter and
the tone of the comments were particularly strong, analysts
said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid told clients. 
    ""The next week will likely see things escalate further given
these tensions, an ECB meeting where little sympathy is likely
to be given, and also the upcoming rating agency actions,"" he
added.  
    S&P Global is due to review Italy's rating next Friday,
October 26 and Moody's is expected to complete a review of
Italy's rating by the end of October.
    A downgrade would put Italy a notch away from junk status
and the potential loss of hundreds of billions of funds that go
with an investment grade rating [nL8N1WP4QO].
    Reports of a disagreement within the Italian coalition also
hurt the country's bond market. 
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday
he would halt an electoral tour in northern Italy and return to
Rome to settle a row within the government over a tax amnesty
[nR1N1W5003].
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields hit 3.77 percent at
one stage, the highest since February 2014, before dropping to
3.72 percent, still up four bps, while two-year yields were up
seven bps at 1.90 percent. <IT10YT=RR>
    The 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at 330 bps,
having hit a fresh 5-1/2 year high of 338 bps earlier in the
day. <DE10IT10=RR>
    Italy's 30-year bond yield hit a 4 1/2-year high of 4.22 pct
before dropping to 4.10 percent, still up five bps on the day
and adding to a 20-bps increase over Wednesday and Thursday.
<IT30YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, trade in euro zone money markets suggested
investors were starting to push back expectations for the timing
of an ECB rate rise to October 2019.
    Having fully priced in a September 2019 hike as recently as
Monday, money markets now suggest just a 85 percent chance of a
10 bps rise then <ECBWATCH>, a sign that investors believe
turmoil in Italy will force a more cautious stance from the ECB.
    The budget wrangling has put a lid on the euro's recent
revival. The single currency on Friday fell towards a two-month
low of $1.14325 <EUR=EBS> and has weakened over one percent this
week.
    But safe-haven German government bonds gained, with 10-year
yields touching a one-month low of 0.39 percent and two-year
yields a two-month low of minus 0.67 percent. German yields are
now around 16 bps below this month's peak. <DE10YT=RR>
<DE2YT=RR>         
    Spanish and Portuguese 10-year government bond yields rose 7
to 8 basis points each to a one-year high of 1.82 percent and a
five-month high of 2.11 percent respectively. <ES10YT=RR>,
<PT10YT=RR> 
    Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger flagged the rise in
Spanish yields as a sign of contagion from Italy, though he said
issues around the Spanish budget also contributed [nL8N1WR24E].

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month
low on Friday after the European Union criticised Italy's
spending plans, raising fresh concern about a conflict within
the common currency zone.
    Political wrangling over the budget in heavily indebted
Italy has seen the euro weaken over 1 percent versus the dollar
this week.
    The European Commision on Thursday sent Rome a letter
calling a draft budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal
rules, the first step of a procedure that could end with
Brussels rejecting the budget and fining Italy. [nL8N1WY6JF].   
 
    The single currency fell to an intra-day low of $1.1433
<EUR=EBS> close to a two-month low of $1.1432 hit on October 9.
At 1100 GMT it traded 0.1 percent up on the day at $1.1464.
    Italy is the third-largest economy of the 19-country euro
zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.
    The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields
reached its widest in 5 1/2 years after news of the Commission
letter broke [nL8N1WY5V7].
    ""The euro is already suffering considerably, and that could
get worse if the crisis really gets going, [especially] as the
dollar is now providing attractive yields,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP yields moved notably
higher ""correlations could well strengthen and this would
provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the
tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the
European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.
    Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an
interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this
week, they were projecting an increase next
September[nL8N1WZ1A9]. 
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against major
peers, traded flat at 95.9 on Friday, close to a two-month high
of 96.155.
    Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel
Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90
percent done but that hurdles remained [nL8N1WZ1DC].
    Sterling rose to a day's high versus the dollar of $1.3038
<GBP=D3>, trading broadly flat. It also strengthened 0.1 percent
against the euro to 87.9 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    The Japanese yen <JPY=D3> weakened 0.2 percent versus the
dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.37.
    A global risk-off mood has prevailed this week amid tension
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy's budget woes and
U.S-Sino trade conflict.
    China's economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5
percent, its weakest since 2009 and below expectations, as a
campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States weighed on the economy [nL4N1WQ2N8].
    The yuan <CNY=D3> changed hands at 6.9341 on Friday, trading
down 0.1 percent versus the dollar, close to a two-month low. 
    ""Expectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to
depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,""
said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note.

    IT'S NOT LIKE BEFORE THE FEB CORRECTION - IT'S WORSE (1207 GMT)
    Those who believe we are just a few days or weeks away from another February-style
correction must bear in mind that the current market environment is actually way worse than it
was at the time. 
    As noted by Makor strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre in his Trans-Market-Express
newsletter, ""back in February this year, most leading equity markets were still in the green
across the blue planet; now, they are - almost universally – in the red"". 
    ""Central bankers in general and the Fed in particular were a lot less hawkish,"" he also
recalls while pointing out that crucially, the U.S. and EU equity stars - mainly tech and luxury
shares - were still shining, quite unlike today.  
    Another point which could be made is that the trade war situation is arguably much worse:
pundits and analysts were expecting Trump to back down ahead of the November mid-term and this 
is no longer the case. 
    For Kevin Muir, the 'MacroTourist' of East West Investment Management, progress on the trade
front is a pre-requisite to invest in equities.          
    ""Absent that, I think rallies should be sold,"" he writes.
     As Barbier de la Serre also notes: ""the February mayhem eventually proved to be mostly
technical in nature, and hence the relative brevity of its spasms"".
    No guarantees it will end so well this time if you add on Brexit and the Italian budget
crisis. 
    See below how world markets have taken a turn for the worse since February at the exception
of Wall Street:

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    EARLY MORNING HEADLINE ROUND-UP: CHINA, CONSTRUCTION, AUTOS IN FOCUS (0546 GMT)
    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Investors shed Italian bonds on
Friday, driving their yields to 4-year highs while the euro fell
to a 2-month low as the European Union called Rome's draft
budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules.
    U.S. stocks were set for a higher open, however, as a
handful of major U.S. corporations beat results forecasts,
offsetting concerns about political and growth risks in Europe,
China and Saudi Arabia. [.N]
    Late on Thursday, the European Commission told Italy that
planned government spending was too high, its structural deficit
would rise instead of fall and public debt would not fall in
line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    Italy is the third-largest economy in the 19-country euro
zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.
    While it isn't unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of their budget plans, the sending
of a formal letter and the tone of the comments were
particularly strong, analysts said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid said in a note to clients. 
    Top euro zone officials insisted Italy's budget plan did not
pose a ""Greek-like"" threat to European financial stability,
[nL8N1WY6VZ] but the row nonetheless led money market investors
to start pushing back expectations for the timing of a European
Central Bank rate rise. [GVD/EUR]  
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent
in early trade on Friday, the highest since February 2014. They
last traded at 3.71 percent. <IT10YT=RR>
    Italian stocks <.FTMIB> fell 0.7 percent, while its bank
stocks <.FTIT8300> were last down 2.2 percent.
    
    CHINA SHARES BOUNCE
    The budget dispute initially weighed on the euro, which fell
to a two-month low, before recovering by afternoon trade in
Europe, last up 0.2 percent on the day. <EUR=D4> [FRX/]
    The closely watched Italian/German bond yield spread hit a
fresh 5-1/2 year high of 338 basis points. <DE10IT10=RR>
    Portuguese and Spanish bonds, that have been resilient so
far through the Italian budget worries, were also sold, with
several analysts suggesting that this was the first sign of
contagion from Italy. [GVD/EUR]
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP (Italian government bond)
yields moved notably higher ""correlations could well strengthen
and this would provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Stock markets all round were a bit lacklustre: data showing
China's economy growing at its slowest pace since 2009 weighed
on shares in Asia, although Chinese shares staged a recovery
after the securities regulator announced a series of measures to
aid the market. [nL3N1WZ1AA]
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> was up 0.2 percent after earlier falling as much
as 0.9 percent ahead of the China GDP reading.
    Australian shares <.AXJO> fell 0.05 percent and Japan's
Nikkei average <.N225> ended 0.6 percent lower for its third
straight week of declines.
    Stocks in Europe managed a modest rise at the start of
trading, but fell back into the red. The pan-European STOXX 600
<.STOXX> index was down 0.1 percent. <.EU>
    The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which
tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent on the day.
It was set for a fourth weekly loss on the trot, which would
make it its longest weekly losing streak since the end of 2015.
    1609 out of 2767 stocks on the index are in a bear market
(58 percent of the total), up from 1557 last week, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Friday.
    In currencies, the dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of the
greenback's value against major peers, was 0.1 percent lower at
95.863. 
    Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel
Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90
percent done although hurdles remained. [GBP/] [nL8N1WZ1DC]
    Oil prices ticked higher after falling on Thursday. U.S.
crude <CLc1> was up 0.6 percent at $69.04 a barrel and Brent
crude <LCOc1> was trading at $79.94 per barrel, 0.8 percent
higher. [O/R]
    Spot gold <XAU=> gained 0.3 percent to $1,227.55 per ounce.

percent in the third quarter of this year from the previous
three months as industrial output stagnated, the Bank of Italy
estimated on Friday.
    Recent data has pointed to slowing activity in the euro
zone's third largest economy, and this month the government
revised down the official estimate for 2018 growth to 1.2
percent from a 1.5 percent projection made in April.
    The faltering economy was one reason given by the ruling
coalition for presenting an expansionary 2019 budget that has
riled the European Commission, which says it will push up
Italy's mammoth public debt.
    ""The available cyclical indicators suggest that in the third
quarter, gross domestic product growth slowed to about 0.1
percent compared with the previous quarter,"" the Bank of Italy
said in its quarterly economic bulletin.
    Italy posted growth of 0.2 percent in the second quarter,
and a 0.1 percent rate in the third would be the slowest since
the second quarter of 2016.
    Italy has been under financial market pressure since the new
government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League took office in June, and a sell-off of
government bonds has accelerated in the last few days.
    The Bank of Italy said foreign investors reduced their
holdings of Italian securities by 42.8 billion euros in the
first eight months of this year, disposing of 24.9 billion euros
of government bonds and 12.4 billion euros of bank bonds.
    Despite the financial market tensions, bank lending to firms
and households is ""rising moderately, supported by a small
expansion in demand,"" the bulletin said.
    In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of new
non-performing loans to outstanding loans fell to 1.5 percent on
a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, the central bank said.
    The ratio was 1.7 percent in the first quarter.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's
policy meeting will be relegated to a sideshow next week as the
wrangle over Italy's budget takes the main stage.
    The Italian government is looking to boost spending in the
hope of engineering faster economic growth.
    But its resolve to breach European Union fiscal rules will
be put to the test as it faces a rebuke from the Commission,
downgrades by credit rating agencies, and a market selloff that
may negate the very stimulus it has hoped for.
    Italy has until Monday to explain to the Commission its
breach of rules and faces the rejection of its budget, which may
eventually lead to sanctions. Neither side has any incentive to
back down for now. 
    For the Rome government, standing up to Brussels could
translate into votes, while for the Commission, giving in would
create a dangerous precedent that could destabilize the euro
zone, especially since the bloc has already been lenient with
Italy's excessive spending.
    The deadlock is costly. Italian bond yields hit their
highest level since early 2014 on Friday and the premium
investors demand in comparison to German debt is at a five and a
half year high. 
    This could hit the economy as Italy sits on a debt pile
worth 130 percent of GDP, the second-highest debt ratio in
Europe after Greece, which has just exited a bailout. 
    ""The European process might not be central,"" Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients.
    ""Ultimately it is the market forces, potentially triggered
by the rating agencies, and the reaction of the real economy to
the tightening in financial conditions, which will seal the fate
of the current experiment in fiscal loosening in Italy.""
    Moody's and Standard and Poor's are both expected to review
their Italian ratings before the month's end and downgrades to
one level above junk are expected by many. 
    While much of this is already priced in, any commentary that
would raise the prospect of a cut to 'junk' could trigger a sell
off as it would carry implications from a loss off access to
central bank facilities to exclusion from investor portfolios.
    Yet even these apparent risks are unlikely now to force the
government to back down and further escalation is likely before
a compromise is found. 
    ""So long as financial market pressures remain manageable, we
find it rational for the government to stick to its strategy
of maintaining tensions with EU institutions, given that it
continues to pay off in terms of popularity,"" Barclays added.
    Commerzbank said an eventual solution may be to finance more
Italian spending from underutilised structural funds instead of
directly burdening the budget.

    ECB
    Italy is also expected to be a top item for the ECB, which
is all but certain to keep policy on hold on Thursday and likely
put off discussion about its reinvestment policy until December.
    Having already made clear that Italy's government is
damaging businesses and households, ECB chief Mario Draghi is
expected to repeat that no help is coming if investors start
dumping Italian assets  en masse. 
    Italian officials have suggested the ECB should use its 2.6
trillion euro bond purchases scheme, due to end in December, to
support stabilise markets.  
    ""It seems that the message needs to be made loud (er) and
clear (er) that quantitative easing is part of the monetary
policy framework and cannot be used to help individual national
governments,"" BAML said.
    The ECB targets an inflation rate just below 2 percent and
has rejected the idea of going beyond this mandate, especially
to help one particular euro area country over another.
    Yet Italy's difficulties could also spell trouble for the
entire bloc, which may eventually prove too difficult to ignore.
    A loss of confidence could spread and drag growth, forcing
the ECB to maintain stimulus longer than it hoped. With much of
its firepower already exhausted from years of support, it has
virtually no scope to extend its bond purchase scheme.

dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week
and the Reuters stories related to them.
    
    1/SEVEN DEADLY…
    The real possibility of the yuan weakening to the
7-per-dollar mark last seen in 2008, hangs over China, emerging
markets and global equities. The thinking so far has been that
the risk of capital outflows, along the lines of what happened
in 2016, would dissuade Beijing from allowing such a slide in
the currency. But more recently, weak benchmark yuan/dollar
fixings, a drop in the trade-weighted yuan index to below 2017
lows, and a flurry of comments and measures from policymakers
reveal both a sense of panic and determination to prop up the
economy.
    With third quarter economic growth slowing to crisis-era
lows, no let-up in Washington's trade rhetoric and a stock
market that's lost 28 percent since February, China has been
forced to ease monetary conditions and is cajoling banks to lend
to small firms. A weaker yuan would complement those stimulus
efforts. 
    Yet a 7-per-dollar yuan would erode faith in the China's
stability and possibly provoke more U.S. ire. And coming on top
of rising U.S. yields, Brexit and Italian politics, it would add
another layer of worry to world markets -- the last thing
investors want to see.

    2/EUROPE'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE        
    Stock market turmoil, conflict over a contentious Italian
budget, high oil prices, sputtering economic growth -- not quite
the backdrop a central bank wants to see three months before its
 it ends its stimulus programme. 
    But that is exactly what the European Central Bank faces
when it meets on Thursday. For now, the heightened risks to the
growth outlook are not expected to derail its plans to end QE by
year-end, but the bank could downgrade the growth risk
assessment in its policy statement.
    That would be a dovish signal and one likely to cheer euro
zone bond markets which have been guided already to not expect a
rise in the ECB's record low rates until well into 2019. No
wonder then, that the gap between short-dated bond yields in the
United States and Germany are at their widest in 30 years, while
10-year euro area bond yields (with the exception of Italy) have
been largely insulated from the recent spike U.S. Treasury
yields.

    3/HOME RUN
    The U.S. housing market, the store of much of Americans'
wealth, has taken a leg down of late, against the backdrop of
the Federal Reserve's signals of another rate hike this year and
more in 2019. With rising borrowing costs and prices
outstripping wage growth, the market has been a weak spot in the
robust economy. So new homes sales data, due on Oct. 24, will be
closely scrutinized. 
    U.S. homebuilding dropped more than expected in September,
while mortgage activity was knocked in the latest week to its
lowest since 2014. The housing market has also been hobbled by
an acute shortage of properties for sale and higher home prices.
Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year
and the latest data supports economists' expectations that
housing remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

    4/APPROACHING JUNK 
    Moody's and S&P Global are likely to cut Italy's credit
rating next week to within a notch of 'junk' -- the
sub-investment grade category below BBB-/Baa1 which is usually
populated by the weaker emerging economies.   
    The downgrades will be premised on Italian plans to boost
spending to boost growth and the impact on a debt ratio that's
already one of the world's worst. They would be the culmination
of a nightmare month which has seen Italian borrowing costs
shoot to 4-1/2-year highs as the European Union labelled its
draft budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of fiscal rules. 
    But Italy's debt is already trading with yields that suggest
investors are pricing it as junk already. So the bigger risk
than a one-notch ratings downgrade is that one or both of the
agencies set the outlook on Italy's rating to Negative, instead
of Stable. That would suggest a fall into junk is a real
possibility in the near future. 
    Loss of investment grade carries a high cost -- hundreds of
billions of euros in fund flows and possibly even a fresh euro
zone crisis.

    5/EUROPEAN AUTOS AND BANKS IN BEAR PIT
    European companies' Q3 earnings are a key test for a market
which according to EPFR Global, has seen investors pull out
almost $5 billion this week. Investors are jumpy about China's
economy, rising costs, trade wars, and lacklustre euro zone
growth.   
    The coming week sees Europe's most hated sectors -- autos
and banks -- reporting earnings. French carmakers Renault and
Peugeot will report figures. Coming after Daimler's profit
warning and negative outlooks from tyre maker Michelin and car
dealership Inchcape, these will be watched for signs of strain
from weaker car demand and higher trade tariffs.
    Results from UBS, Barclays, Nordea and the struggling
Deutsche Bank will give a read on how bad things are for the
banking sector.
    Analysts have slashed earnings forecasts for carmakers
consistently over the past six months – and have become 
increasingly pessimistic on banks' earnings since March. Shares
in both sectors are in bear territory, having fallen around 20
percent this year. 
    Earnings for MSCI Europe companies are seen growing more in
2019 than 2018, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows. And while earnings
expectations were relatively stable in 2017, pessimism over
Europe this year has led analysts to steadily downgrade their
forecasts.

    By Tommy Wilkes and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The formation of Italy's
anti-establishment government and its intensifying row with
European Union authorities have lifted correlations between the
country's bonds and the euro to the highest since 2013. 
    That could be read as a sign of stress, namely worries that
Italy's woes would threaten the single currency. But lack of
contagion in other euro bond markets suggests otherwise, and
some reckon it may reflect expectations of European Central Bank
policy action should the dispute over Italy's budget escalate.
    Italian borrowing costs have surged to the highest since
early 2014, while the gap between 10-year German and Italian
government bonds - known as the Bund/BTP spread and a key
measure of Italian risk -- is also at its highest in more than
five years <IT10DE10=RR>
    But unlike the 2010-2012 Greek crisis, there has been little
spillover into other euro zone bond markets. Instead, it is the
euro that is feeling the blowback, approaching 15-month lows
<EUR=EBS> [L8N1WS26W].
    It has lost 6.6 percent versus the dollar since Italy's
early-March election that returned two parties once keen on a
return to the lira.
    Some of that is probably down to the dollar's rally, fuelled
by a strengthening U.S. economy. But there is also evidence that
the inverse correlation between the euro/dollar rate and the
BTP/Bund spread has strengthened considerably this year, meaning
the euro weakened each time the spread widened, as the following
chart shows:
   
    The inverse correlation, based on a 130-day period, rose to
87 percent at the end of August. In January, correlation was
near zero, Reuters analysis shows. Currently it stands at 84
percent.
    Correlations were previously this negative in late-2012/
early-2013, just after ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do
""whatever it takes"" to save the single currency.
    The inverse correlation clearly reflects concern that
populist politicians will pursue fiscally unsustainable policies
that euro zone authorities can do little to stop.
    But markets also clearly retain faith in Draghi's promise,
with bets growing he will act if the Italian situation worsens.
That in itself makes the current bubbling crisis different from
2012 in that the bloc's existence is not seen at risk.
    ""There is a view which is not really consensus yet, but
there is momentum towards the view that the ECB will probably
adopt a more dovish exit than what has been priced, as a result
of Italy and also because of expansion not being that strong,""
said Shweta Singh, senior economist at TS Lombard.
    So each time the Italian situation appears to worsen and
spreads widen, bets grow on ECB action, possibly by delaying
rate rises, currently expected next September. 
    On Friday, after the EU called the Italian draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of fiscal rules, the euro dipped to as
low as $1.1433 and the BTP/Bund spread widened to a fresh 5
1/2-year high [nL8N1WY213] [nL8N1WZ16J].
    Money markets, meanwhile, cut their bets on a September 2019
rate rise by the ECB. Bets have instead been pushed back to next
October.

    KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced on Friday it
would raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter as Prime
Minister Volodymyr Groysman warned that the country risked
default if it crashed out of its International Monetary Fund aid
programme.
    Raising household gas tariffs is a key condition of IMF aid,
but Kiev had until now refused to increase them.  
    ""We have no other option to prevent extremely difficult
events,"" Groysman said during a televised cabinet meeting.
    ""If we are not able to continue cooperation with our
international partners,"" Groysman warned, then the country will
not be able to service its debt. 
    ""This may lead to the situation when Ukraine will be put
into default,"" he said.
    Ukraine's eurobonds rose across the curve following the
announcement. [nL8N1WZ4WD]  
    Ukraine was obliged to raise household gas tariffs to
qualify for more aid under a $17.5 billion IMF programme that
expires next year, when the country heads into two elections and
must service a rising debt burden.
    IMF aid has been effectively frozen since April 2017 as
Ukraine's performance on reforms slowed down and due to the
government's refusal to raise gas prices, which have been kept
artificially low since Soviet times, to market levels.
    If Ukraine receives another tranche of IMF money, that would
also allow the government to go to the market to issue new debt
and would also pave the way for the European Union and other
foreign donors to disburse more aid.
    Groysman said household gas prices would be raised by 23.5
percent from Nov 1.

    By Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk
    KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced on Friday it
would raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter as Prime
Minister Volodymyr Groysman warned that the country risked
default if it crashed out of its International Monetary Fund aid
programme.
    Raising gas prices was an IMF requirement and takes the
government a step closer to securing another aid tranche before
the deal expires next year, when the country heads into
back-to-back elections and must service a rising debt burden.
    If Ukraine receives another tranche, that would allow the
government to go to the market to issue new debt and would also
pave the way for the European Union and other foreign donors to
disburse more aid.
    The government initially had agreed to raise gas prices but
later backtracked, knowing the potential for voter anger during
presidential and parliamentary elections. 
    ""We have no other option to prevent extremely difficult
events,"" Groysman said during a televised cabinet meeting.
    ""If we are not able to continue cooperation with our
international partners,"" Groysman warned, then the country will
not be able to service its debt. 
    ""This may lead to the situation when Ukraine will be put
into default,"" he said, a return to the 1990s of
""hyper-inflation, price increases, wage devaluation.""
    Ukraine's eurobonds rose across the curve following the
announcement. [nL8N1WZ4WD] The IMF did not immediately offer
comment after Groysman's announcement.
    Giving a taste of the backlash that is likely to follow,
Olena Babak, a lawmaker of the opposition Samopomich party, told
the 112 news channel that it would push Ukrainians into poverty.
    ""This is a crime against Ukraine. There is enough Ukrainian
gas for consumers and for heating supply,"" she said. 
    The IMF joined efforts to rescue Ukraine from economic
crisis following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the
outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency.  
    But IMF aid has effectively been frozen since April 2017 as
Ukraine's performance on reforms slowed down and due to the
government's refusal to raise gas prices, kept artificially low
since Soviet times, to market levels.
    Ukraine wants the IMF to agree to a new standby aid
agreement to maintain financial stability and the confidence of
investors and foreign allies through the elections. [nL8N1W62PV]
     The IMF also wants Ukraine to keep its budget deficit in
check, which will put the spotlight on discussions on the 2019
budget which parliament must vote on by the end of the year.  
    Groysman said household gas prices would be raised by 23.5
percent from Nov 1.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italy's government bond yields
fell from 4-1/2 year highs and its stock market rallied on
Friday after European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici said he wanted to reduce tensions with Italy over the
country's contentious budget plans.
    Speaking at a news conference after a two-day visit to Rome,
Moscovici said Brussels shared Italy's declared goals of
boosting growth and cutting debt, and reiterated that no
decision had yet been taken over the budget.
    He said he did not fear contagion to other euro zone
countries stemming from the market tensions over Italy.
[nR1N1W5006]
    His remarks brought relief to Italian markets just a day

over the budget, labelling it an unprecedented breach of EU
fiscal rules, and sparking another violent selloff.[nL8N1WZ16J]
    ""It is hard to believe that he (Moscovici) is making these
comments having sent the letter yesterday. It shows his change
of tone and indicates that Brussels is mindful of the market
reaction and the corresponding risks,"" said Michael Leister,
rates strategist at Commerzbank.
    ""There was a new dimension in the sell-off in reaction to
this letter, Spain and Portugal showed clear sings of contagion
and Brussels has realised it wasn't the best strategy to

    Italian bond yields were up to 17 basis points lower on the
day, fully reversing earlier rises. [nL8N1WZ16J]
    Ten-year bond yields were down 10 bps at 3.57 percent
<IT10YT=RR>, down from a 4-1/2 year high hit earlier at 3.78
percent.
    Thirty-year bond yields fell from a 4-1/2 year high of
around 4.15 percent <IT30YT=RR>, while two-year yields were down
17 bps after rising almost 20 bps on Thursday. 
    The 10-year bond yield gap over safer Germany -- effectively
the risk premium on Italian bonds -- narrowed to 312 bps, having
hit its widest in 5-1/2 years at around 338 bps.    
    As Italy's bond market rallied, the country's top stock
index <.FTMIB> climbed into positive territory, trading up 0.25
percent. The bank stocks index <.FTIT8300> also rapidly pared
losses, last trading up 0.03 percent. 
    Banking stocks had come under heavy selling pressure earlier
in the day from the renewed spike in sovereign bond yields.
    Italian lenders hold around 375 billion euros of domestic
bonds - accounting for 10 percent of their assets - and the
spike in yields, by eroding the value of those holdings, eats
into their capital levels.
    Earlier on Friday, five-year credit default swaps in Italian
bank UniCredit <CRDI.MI> rose to 204 basis points, from a
closing price of 194 bps on Thursday and was the highest since
Dec 2016 <UNIC5YEUAM=MG>. [nL8N1WZ3SM]
    ""Ultimately there could be a good outcome but we will get a
lot of negative headlines in between that,"" said Timothy Graf,
head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street.
    ""But Italy isn't Greece. Its external balances are healthier
and it's a much more important economy and I don't think the
brinkmanship that was allowable with Greece is allowable with
Italy,"" he said, referring to the Greek debt crisis.
    The recovery in Italian debt also weakened demand for bond
safe havens. 
    Germany's 10-year Bund yield rose 2 bps at 0.44 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, having hit its lowest in almost six weeks at 0.39
percent. Two-year German bond yields rose from two-month lows at
minus around 0.67 percent <DE2YT=RR>.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A report on risks to the
stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff if
Britain leaves the EU with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be finalised in coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks and the BoE have called on Brussels to take preventive
action to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives
contracts if there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern, but the private sector could
take action to mitigate risks, such as shifting contracts from
London to the EU before March.
    Once the interim report is finalised, ""we can see what
concrete steps are necessary, whether there are also some
regulatory steps that are necessary,"" Dombrovskis said.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Asked about concerns over derivatives in a no-deal Brexit,
Dombrovskis' top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, said: ""There
is no cliff.""
    ""On 30th of March... nothing happens,"" Guersent said, adding
that contracts would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
    But banks say Brussels is slow to deal with potential
contract disruption in order to pile pressure on them to staff
new hubs in the EU before March and shift the contracts to them.
    Mark Hoban, head of the IRSG, a financial services think
tank backed by the financial sector, said the sector was waiting
for regulators in Britain and the EU to sign cooperation
agreements to deal with potential disruption to contracts.
    ""My suspicion is that you have got MOUs stuck in desk
drawers on both sides of the Channel. What the regulators are
waiting for is the green light from the Commission that allows
conversations to happen.""
    Giving the green light would give markets more confidence
about Brexit Day, but instead there is unhelpful brinkmanship,
Hoban said.

    By Natalia Zinets and Matthias Williams
    KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine secured a new $3.9 billion
stand-by aid agreement with the International Monetary Fund on
Friday, helping the country maintain financial stability and the
trust of investors as it heads into a choppy election period
next year. 
    The IMF announced the deal hours after the government
decided to raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter, an
outstanding IMF requirement, as the prime minister warned the
country was headed for default without an IMF deal.
    The new agreement would span 14 months and replaces the
previous $17.5 billion aid programme that has propped up
Ukraine's war-battered economy since 2015. 
    It is subject to Ukraine passing a 2019 budget in line with
the IMF's requirements and the approval of the IMF's executive
board, which is expected to take a decision later in the year,
the IMF said. 
    ""The new SBA ... will provide an anchor for the authorities'
economic policies during 2019,"" an IMF statement said. 
    ""... it will focus in particular on continuing with fiscal
consolidation and reducing inflation, as well as reforms to
strengthen tax administration, the financial sector and the
energy sector.""  
    
    'NO OTHER OPTION'
    The new deal will allow the government, which must service a
rising debt burden next year, to go to the market to issue new
debt and would also pave the way for the European Union and
other foreign donors to disburse more aid.
    The government initially had agreed to raise gas prices but
later backtracked, knowing the potential for voter anger during
presidential and parliamentary elections. 
    ""We have no other option to prevent extremely difficult
events,"" Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said during a
televised cabinet meeting earlier on Friday. 
    ""If we are not able to continue cooperation with our
international partners,"" Groysman warned, then the country will
not be able to service its debt. 
    ""This may lead to the situation when Ukraine will be put
into default,"" he said, a return to the 1990s of
""hyper-inflation, price increases, wage devaluation.""
    Ukraine's eurobonds rose across the curve following the
announcement of a gas price hike. [nL8N1WZ4WD] 
    Giving a taste of the backlash that is likely to follow,
Olena Babak, a lawmaker of the opposition Samopomich party, told
the 112 news channel that it would push Ukrainians into poverty.
    ""This is a crime against Ukraine,"" she said. 
    The IMF joined efforts to rescue Ukraine from economic
crisis following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the
outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency.  
    But IMF aid had effectively been frozen since April 2017 as
Ukraine's performance on reforms slowed down and due to the
government's refusal to raise gas prices, kept artificially low
since Soviet times, to market levels.
    The spotlight will now be on discussions on the 2019 budget
which parliament must vote on by the end of the year. One
sticking point could be Ukraine's plans for a change to how
companies are taxed. [nL8N1WY25V] 
    Groysman said household gas prices would be raised by 23.5
percent from Nov 1.

of concern and the situation will not get easier next year when
money will be no longer as easy to obtain from the European
Central Bank, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said.
    ""Italy is in a much better position than Greece, but the
level of debt is indeed worrying,"" Nowotny said in an interview
with Austrian daily Kurier published on Saturday. 
    Italy's public debt stood at more than 130 percent of GDP
last year, the highest in the euro zone after Greece. But the
Italian government is looking to boost spending to engineer
faster economic growth, flouting European Union rules.

    Concerns over the budget plans contributed to an increase in
 the spread between German and Italian benchmark 10-year bonds
to 5-1/2 year highs and later on Friday credit rating agency
Moody's cut the country's sovereign debt rating to one notch
above junk status. [nL3N1WZ5VO]    
    In 2018 and 2019, Rome will have to borrow around 380
billion euros ($438 billion) each on the capital market,
Nowotny, who is also the chief of Austria's central bank, said. 
    ""But someone has to buy these government bonds. And it turns
out that this is only possible at higher interest rates. That in
turn increases the budget deficit.""
    As the ECB's bond purchase programme will end this year, it
is mostly Italian banks buying the bonds, the veteran
policymaker said. ""The interdependence is problematic."" 
    The wrangle over Italy's budget is expected to top the
agenda at the ECB meeting on Thursday.

    ATHENS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive
has approved Greece's first post-bailout draft budget without
requiring the implementation of legislated pension cuts, the
Greek prime minister said on Saturday.
    Athens emerged from its final international bailout in
August and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pushed to rescind
unpopular pension cuts slated for January as part of austerity
measures, claiming there is ample fiscal space to do so.
    Trailing the conservative opposition in polls, Tsipras is
counting on a less austere budget to win over voters next year,
when his term expires.
   ""The European Commission approved the Greek budget without
pension cuts after eight years of austerity,"" Tsipras said,
calling the development a ""success"".
    There was no immediate comment from the EU's executive.
    The government has argued it does not need to implement the
pension cuts agreed with creditors, as it aims to outperform on
primary surplus targets for a fifth straight year.
    Greece has promised its euro zone lenders and the
International Monetary Fund it will achieve a 3.5 percent of GDP
primary budget surplus this year, excluding debt servicing
outlays. 
    In its draft 2019 budget it targets a surplus of 4.14
percent of GDP next year. If it does not apply the pension cuts
it puts the figure at 3.56 percent. [nL8N1WH601]
    The draft budget projects economic growth will pick up to
2.5 percent in 2019 from an expected 2.1 percent this year.
    The government is now expected to submit its final draft
next month and put it on a parliamentary vote in December.

to leave the single currency and would drop out only if it were
forced to, Italian European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona said
on Saturday in a televised speech.
    The sustainability of Italy's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.7
billion) debt, one of the world's largest, has resurfaced as a
potential problem since a populist government rose to power in
May on promises of higher spending.
    Debt rating agency Moody's on Friday cut Italy's sovereign
debt rating to one notch above junk status because of concerns
over government budget plans. But Moody's also said the outlook
for Italy's rating was now stable. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    ""Italy's debt is perfectly solvent, there is no question
that Italy may default on its debt,"" Savona, a eurosceptic
economist, told a business conference in Capri.
    ""There is no chance, as far as Italy and my government are
concerned, that Italy's public debt runs a so-called
redenomination risk, that it may reject the euro. If this event
happens, it will be for reasons outside of the country's will."" 
  
    Savona's appointment as finance minister in the current
government was vetoed by Italy's President Sergio Mattarella who
said it risked propelling the country out of the euro.

1836,4424,ef04af58d3387cd256e79f5480fb05cb,"Italy should not ignore damage to banks from soaring bond yields, official tells paper",2018-10-21 18:25:58,EUR,-0.53866,2018-10-21 18:26:06,{},"    MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Italy's government should not
ignore the problems that soaring government bond yields are
causing for Italian banks, including  possible capital needs,
Cabinet Undersecretary Giancarlo Giorgetti said in a newspaper
interview on Sunday.
    Giorgetti also told Italian daily Il Messaggero that next
year's budget deficit may turn out to be lower than the proposed
2.4 percent of gross domestic output.
    The profligate budget plans of Italy's populist government
have prompted investors to shed 67 billion euros ($77 billion)
of Italian government bonds since May, sending the yield premium
Italy pays over safer German paper to more than 3 percentage
points.
    ""The increase in the (bond yield) spread, the amount of
public debt banks hold and new European Union banking rules put
the industry under pressure and may generate the need to
recapitalise the most fragile lenders,"" said Giorgetti, who is
an influential member of the far right League, one of the two
parties in Italy's ruling coalition. 
    Italian banks had been raising capital in recent years to
restructure after a deep recession that turned almost a fifth of
all bank loans sour.
    The clean-up was just beginning to bear fruit when lenders
were hit by a spike in Italy's debt costs, which hurts the value
of their large sovereign holdings, eating into their capital.
    Pummelled by investors, Italian banks' shares trade at a
fraction of the value of their assets but the growing
uncertainty over Italy's prospects would make it hard for them
to raise capital.
    ""We can't just pretend nothing is happening and ignore these
problems,"" Giorgetti said.
    He said the government was made up of ""responsible people
who would do things responsibly.""
    After initially rebuffing criticism from Brussels over a
sharp deficit increase in the draft 2019 budget, which the
European Commission has labelled an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU
fiscal rules, Italy appeared to have softened its stance.
    On Saturday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Rome wanted
to establish a ""constructive dialogue"" with the EU over the
budget because it recognised the role of European institutions.
[nL8N1X00MA]
    ""The 2.4 percent figure is a ceiling for all the various
measures included in the budget, but it's not a given that all
of them can be implemented because there could be technical
difficulties,"" Giorgetti said.
    The coalition comprising the League and the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement wants to boost
deficit-spending to lower the retirement age and provide a basic
income for the poor.

    MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and
Five-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said on Sunday he was committed
to preserving the country's membership of the euro zone.
    Rome's anti-establishment government is striving to reassure
investors after a draft 2019 budget driving the deficit higher
prompted a market sell-off and sent the risk premium that
Italian bonds pay over safer German paper to a 5-1/2 year high
of 3.4 percentage points.
    ""We understood from conversations with people from the ECB
(European Central Bank) and the markets, meaning investors, that
the (bond yield spread) jumped because there is a concern that
this government wants to leave the euro or the European Union,""
Di Maio told RAI state television.
    ""I want to say it here, and there will be other solemn
occasions to reiterate it as a government and a political party,
... there is no Plan B (to leave Europe) but only Plan A which
is to change Europe,"" Di Maio said.
    ""As long as I'm head of this movement and a minister of this
government I'll always guarantee that Italy remains within the
euro and in Europe,"" he added.
    The ECB declined to comment on Di Maio's remark about
conversations with people from the central bank.
    Euro break-up fears have resurfaced since a coalition
comprising the anti-establishment 5-Star and the eurosceptic
League party came to power in Italy in May. Foreign investors
have shed 67 billion euros ($77 billion) in Italian government
bonds since then.
    Faced with a spike in debt costs which is undermining the
country's banks and could risk choking off the economy, the Rome
government has sought to strike a more conciliatory tone over
the budget but it has so far stopped short of saying it may
revise down next year's deficit goal.
    A government source told Reuters Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Foreign Minister Enzo
Moavero Milanesi had unsuccessfully pushed for a reduction of
the deficit target at a cabinet meeting on Saturday.
    Di Maio said the government was preparing a letter in reply
to the EU Commission's criticism of the budget which would be
sent on Monday with the Commission expected to react shortly
after that.
    ""I hope the explanations we will provide over a long
discussion process ... could lead the Commission to share the
goals we have set,"" he said.
    The Commission has labelled Rome's plan to lift the budget
deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output next year from 1.8
percent in 2018 an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules.
    Credit rating agency Moody's on Friday downgraded Italy's
debt to one notch above junk status citing concerns over the
government's budget plans.
    Di Maio said he hoped the Commission would take into account
in its assessment Italy's strengths such as the private sector's
low debt and high household wealth, which Moody's cited among
reasons supporting a 'stable' outlook on the rating.
    He denied however the government was considering a wealth
tax to help reduce Italy's 2.3 trillion euro public debt.
    After riding popular anger at the austerity measures Italy
adopted in response to the euro zone crisis of 2011-2012, the
League and the 5 Star want to lower the retirement age and
provide a basic income for the poor. 
    Di Maio said Italy had a chance to prove public debt could
be reduced by ""investing in social rights"" and trigger important
changes across Europe.
    Di Maio said the 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo,
was working to present in January-February a programme that
brought together similar grassroots movements from other
European countries with the goal to ""give back a heart and
humanity to European institutions.""

    MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The Italian government expects the
European Commission to decide for the first time ever on Tuesday
to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, a government

    Since receiving beefed-up powers in 2013 over member states'
budgetary plans, the Commission has never asked a country to
submit a revised budget.
    Italy's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.65 trillion) public debt, one
of the world's largest, makes the country vulnerable and a
potential source of contagion for other euro zone countries.
    Investors have shed 67 billion euros in Italian bonds since
a populist government formed in May, sending the risk premium
Italy pays over safer German paper to a 5-1/2 year high of 3.4
percentage points. 
    The source said Economy Minister Giovanni Tria and Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte had unsuccessfully pushed for a
reduction of the 2019 deficit target at a cabinet meeting on
Saturday.
    The source did not rule out an agreement to lower the
deficit goal could be found during a three-week period of
negotiations with Brussels that will follow the rejection.
    Though the decision was expected on Tuesday, the source said
it may not be announced on the same day.
    Asked for comment, a Commission spokesman said that the
Commission had expressed its ""serious concerns"" over the draft
budget to the Italian authorities, seeking clarifications by
noon on Monday to facilitate an assessment.
    Earlier on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said
the government was working on the letter it would send to the
Commission on Monday, adding he expected a speedy reaction.
    Di Maio, who leads the ruling anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement, told RAI state television he hoped the explanations
Rome would provide ""over a long discussion process ... could
lead the Commission to share the goals we have set.""
    After riding popular anger at the austerity measures Italy
adopted in response to the euro zone crisis of 2011-2012,
Italy's ruling coalition, also comprising the far-right League,
wants to lower the retirement age and provide a basic income for
the poor.
    On Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Italy's
debt to one notch above junk status citing concerns over the
government's budget plans.
    
    NO PLAN B
    Di Maio said he hoped the Commission would take into account
Italy's strengths such as the private sector's low debt and high
household wealth, which Moody's cited among reasons supporting a
'stable' outlook on the rating.
    He joined other government members in efforts to dispel
concerns about Italy's euro membership.    
    ""We understood from conversations with people from the ECB
(European Central Bank) and the markets, meaning investors, that
the (bond yield spread) jumped because there is a concern that
this government wants to leave the euro or the European Union,""
Di Maio said.
    ""I want to say it here, and there will be other solemn
occasions to reiterate it as a government and a political party,
... there is no Plan B (to leave Europe) but only Plan A which
is to change Europe,"" Di Maio said.
    ""As long as I'm head of this movement and a minister of this
government I'll always guarantee that Italy remains within the
euro and in Europe,"" he added.
    The ECB declined to comment on Di Maio's remark about
conversations with people from the central bank.
    Di Maio said Italy had a chance to prove public debt could
be reduced by ""investing in social rights"" and trigger important
changes across Europe.
    He said the 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, was
working to present in January-February a programme that brought
together similar grassroots movements from other European
countries with the goal to ""give back a heart and humanity to
European institutions."" ($1 = 0.8686 euros)

    * Most investors think Italian budget standoff contained
    * But euro may be more closely linked to politics than
understood 
    * Euro and BTP/bund spread inverse correlation as high as 87
pct

    By Tommy Wilkes and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The formation of Italy's
anti-establishment government and its intensifying row with
European Union authorities have lifted correlations between the
country's bonds and the euro to the highest since 2013. 
    That could be read as a sign of stress, namely worries that
Italy's woes would threaten the single currency. But lack of
contagion in other euro bond markets suggests otherwise, and
some reckon it may reflect expectations of European Central Bank
policy action should the dispute over Italy's budget escalate.
    Italian borrowing costs have surged to the highest since
early 2014, while the gap between 10-year German and Italian
government bonds - known as the Bund/BTP spread and a key
measure of Italian risk -- is also at its highest in more than
five years <IT10DE10=RR>
    But unlike the 2010-2012 Greek crisis, there has been little
spillover into other euro zone bond markets. Instead, it is the
euro that is feeling the blowback, approaching 15-month lows
<EUR=EBS> [L8N1WS26W].
    It has lost 6.6 percent versus the dollar since Italy's
early-March election that returned two parties once keen on a
return to the lira.
    Some of that is probably down to the dollar's rally, fuelled
by a strengthening U.S. economy. But there is also evidence that
the inverse correlation between the euro/dollar rate and the
BTP/Bund spread has strengthened considerably this year, meaning
the euro weakened each time the spread widened, as the following
chart shows:
   
    The inverse correlation, based on a 130-day period, rose to
87 percent at the end of August. In January, correlation was
near zero, Reuters analysis shows. Currently it stands at 84
percent.
    Correlations were previously this negative in late-2012/
early-2013, just after ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do
""whatever it takes"" to save the single currency.
    The inverse correlation clearly reflects concern that
populist politicians will pursue fiscally unsustainable policies
that euro zone authorities can do little to stop.
    But markets also clearly retain faith in Draghi's promise,
with bets growing he will act if the Italian situation worsens.
That in itself makes the current bubbling crisis different from
2012 in that the bloc's existence is not seen at risk.
    ""There is a view which is not really consensus yet, but
there is momentum towards the view that the ECB will probably
adopt a more dovish exit than what has been priced, as a result
of Italy and also because of expansion not being that strong,""
said Shweta Singh, senior economist at TS Lombard.
    So each time the Italian situation appears to worsen and
spreads widen, bets grow on ECB action, possibly by delaying
rate rises, currently expected next September. 
    On Friday, after the EU called the Italian draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of fiscal rules, the euro dipped to as
low as $1.1433 and the BTP/Bund spread widened to a fresh 5
1/2-year high [nL8N1WY213] [nL8N1WZ16J].
    Money markets, meanwhile, cut their bets on a September 2019
rate rise by the ECB. Bets have instead been pushed back to next
October.

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Growing concern about the impact
of trade tensions on the economic outlook, another spike in
Italian borrowing costs, fraught Brexit talks and volatility in
world markets make for a colorful backdrop to Thursday's
European Central Bank meeting. 
    The ECB is expected to repeat that its 2.6 trillion euro
($3.0 trillion) bond-buying scheme is likely to end at the close
of the year, with bond markets hoping for details on how
reinvestments from maturing bonds will be channeled next year.
    Here are some key questions that may come up.
    
    1. How worried is the ECB about growing risks to the growth
outlook?
    
    Economists were unanimous in a recent Reuters poll that the
ECB will end its bond-buying stimulus by year-end, with a low
likelihood of an extension in the face of political and trade
worries.[nL3N1WV48S]
    But growing concern about the economic outlook may be hard
to ignore as trade wars take a toll. This month, the
International Monetary Fund cut its world economic growth
forecasts for 2018 and 2019, and Europe's biggest economy
Germany lowered its growth projections.[nL2N1WP03N][nB4N1SN029]
    Minutes of the ECB's September meeting showed that at least
some policymakers debated whether to downgrade their growth risk
assessment, which they described as ""broadly balanced"".
[nL8N1WR3P0] [nL5N1VZ2OK]
    ""Global downside risks, and the possibility of further
increases in those risks from here which could formally tip the
balance towards downside risks in the statement, are the main
things to watch,"" said Pictet Wealth Management strategist
Frederik Ducrozet. 
    
    
    2. When will the ECB start discussing rate hikes?
    
    The ECB is likely to repeat the line it has laid out since
June: that rates will remain on hold through the summer of 2019.
    That's not to say a question on the rate-hike debate will
not come up at ECB chief Mario Draghi's press conference. 
    Dutch central bank governor Klaas Knot said earlier this
month the ECB will have to start discussing the timing of a rate
hike in January.
    Draghi also stirred the rate debate with his recent
reference to a ""relatively vigorous"" rise in underlying
inflation -- comments that have been toned down
since.[nF9N1U500I]
    At the same time, market turmoil in Italy has ignited some
caution into investor rate-hike expectations <ECBWATCH>.
    
    3. Will the ECB spell out its plans for reinvestments?
    
    This is the big question for euro zone bond markets, given
that reinvestments of funds from maturing bonds held by the ECB
will continue to buffer debt once new buying ends. 
    The ECB has said it will reinvest funds from maturing bonds
but has yet to spell out details and there is some talk about
whether the bank will target its funds at longer-dated bonds.
    Some policymakers have even advocated not rolling over
corporate bonds and spending the proceeds elsewhere, Reuters
reported last month. [nL5N1W052R][nL8N1WO44Y]
    But policymakers also said that any changes to the ECB's
reinvestment policy are likely to be mostly technical, aimed at
keeping purchases smooth. For an interactive version of the
below chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Nqxh3Z.  
      
    4. What about the ECB's capital key, isn't that due a
change? 
    
    That's right - the ECB is due to update its capital key, the
amount of capital each member state has paid in, at the start of
2019 to reflect changes in the size of their economies.
    Draghi has said the ECB would follow its capital key when
deciding how to deploy its reinvestments, so any changes here
are potentially key.
    Economists estimate that a new capital key would see
Germany's weight increase while Italy's and Spain's fall --
implying lower reinvestment flows into those countries.
    However, while Germany's weighting is likely to rise, a
scarcity of eligible German debt for ECB purchases means there
is little if any scope to buy more bonds from the country.
    ""These are technical issues that usually nobody would care
about, but in this instance it is important because for the
foreseeable future, reinvestments are the main policy tool that
the ECB will use,"" said Jefferies senior European economist
Marchel Alexandrovich. 
    
    5. What is the ECB's tolerance to Italian risks? 
    
    Since the ECB last met, Italy's anti-establishment
government has delivered an expansionary budget -- sparking a
clash with the EU and sending Italian bond yields up sharply.
The bond selloff has rippled into Italian banking stocks,
broader share markets and the euro.
    Recent correlations between euro/dollar and the
German/Italian bond spread have started to strengthen,
highlighting the currency's sensitivity to Italian bond market
volatility.
    Draghi said this month that Italian officials must stop
questioning the euro and need to ""calm down"" in their budget
debate as they have already hurt firms and households.
[nL8N1WT0OD][nL8N1WR437]
    And not everybody is convinced that Italian risks will
remain a localized affair. Alessio De Longis and Ben Rockmuller,
portfolio managers at Oppenheimer Funds, have reduced their
exposure to European equities in favor of U.S. equities citing
growing concerns on Italy.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Preliminary results in Poland's
weekend local elections are coming through today, but already it
looks like a less-than- resounding victory for the ruling Law
and Justice (PiS) party. Notably they failed to carry off the
main prize of Warsaw and lost in other urban areas, where
scepticism about the PiS brand of socially conservative,
autocratic rule is highest. It is too early to make predictions
about what this means for next year's parliamentary elections,
but a similar result could allow opposition parties to band
together and defeat PiS.
    Whether the presence on Saturday of some 700,000 people on
the streets of London calling for a fresh vote on Brexit will
influence events remains to be seen, but in the meantime its
business as usual on the impasse story. UK Brexit negotiator
Dominic Raab's suggestion that he could accept an extension of
the post-Brexit transition period, but only if the Irish
backstop was dropped. That was been promptly shot down by
Dublin; it was always unlikely that the EU side would back down
from a key part of its negotiating stance so cheaply. Today PM
Theresa May will attempt to quell some of the mounting domestic
criticism of her handling of the talks by telling parliament
that the deal is 95 percent done.
    Perhaps with a view to pre-empting the market impact of
negative news, Italian sources said at the weekend they expect
the European Commission to reject Rome's 2019 budget as early as
Tuesday. In the meantime, Italian bonds have perked up on the
back of 5-Star leader Luigi di Maio's assurance that Italy wants
to remain in the euro and the relief that Moody's at least kept
its outlook on Italian debt stable despite an expected downgrade
of its sovereign rating to Baa3 on Friday.

MARKETS 7.55 A.M.   
Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of
stock market support saw Chinese shares stage their biggest
one-day surge in almost three years, while 10-year Italian
borrowing costs recorded their biggest one-day plunge since June
after Moody’s credit firm on Friday downgraded Italy’s sovereign
rating to the final rung of investment grade but revised its
outlook to stable from negative. The two influences brightened
the increasingly gloomy mood on world markets rattled by the
Sino-U.S. trade war, rising U.S. interest rates, Italy’s
standoff and messy Brexit negotiations. With the current
corporate earnings season also chiming in as a positive so far,
stock markets around the world have bounced back modestly after
last week’s steep losses. While the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI300
benchmark climbed more than 4 percent – its biggest daily jump
since November 2015 – and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose more than 2
percent, gains in Tokyo and Seoul were a more restrained 0.3
percent. U.S. and European stock futures were up about 0.4
percent. MSCI’s all-country world stock market index was up 0.2
percent after losses of almost 4 percent last week, its worst
week since March. 
    In Italy, Moody’s decision to move the sovereign ratings to
stable eased outside fears of another imminent cut of the rating
to ""junk"" status and stoked hopes S&P would do likewise when it
reviews the credit this Friday coming. The sharp 25-basis-point
drop in 10-year Italian yields and some 40-basis-point retreat
in two-year yields also reflects the degree of speculative
positioning in that market at the end of last week. Moody’s said
its decision to downgrade Italy was because the new government’s
controversial budget was only likely to stabilise the country’s
debt-to-GDP ratio rather than set it on a downward path as
promised with European Union monitors, leaving the country’s
budget math and debt sustainability more open to a surprise
domestic or global growth shock. Although the European
Commission is expected to ask Rome to re-draft the budget, it’s
not clear yet whether it will enact its ""excessive deficit
procedure"" that could lead to penalties on Rome. EU commissioner
Pierre Moscovici said a period of dialogue was not necessary. So
far, the government insists it can convince Brussels of the
merits of its plans. Deputy PM Di Maio said on Monday the
government was ready to discuss the plans, was mindful of recent
bond market moves and had no intention of leaving the euro. 
    With one eye on this week’s European Central Bank meeting,
the bond market rally in Italy helped the euro/dollar exchange
rate higher first thing Monday. The dollar was a touch easier
more broadly, with the yen underperforming as world stock
markets rallied. Sterling was steady after failure to reach a
Brexit agreement at last week EU summit has shifted attention
back onto UK PM Theresa May’s position within her own party back
at home. An estimated two-thirds of a million people took to the
streets of London at the weekend demanding another referendum on
Brexit.
    In corporate news, trade-hit automakers will be in focus
after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli unit for
6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hit last week by
Daimler's profit warning, could find support after Chancellor
Angela Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the
threat of air pollution leading to driving bans. Italian banks
could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after
the  Moody's move. In earnings, eyes were on Ryanair after it
posted a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warned that
European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter.
Philips saw its profit rising less than expected, due to
currency headwinds.

    The real possibility of the yuan weakening to the
7-per-dollar mark last seen in 2008, hangs over China, emerging
markets and global equities. The thinking so far has been that
the risk of capital outflows, along the lines of what happened
in 2016, would dissuade Beijing from allowing such a slide in
the currency. But more recently, weak benchmark yuan/dollar
fixings, a drop in the trade-weighted yuan index to below 2017
lows, and a flurry of comments and measures from policymakers
reveal both a sense of panic and determination to prop up the
economy.
    With third-quarter economic growth slowing to crisis-era
lows, no let-up in Washington's trade rhetoric and a stock
market that's lost 28 percent since February, China has been
forced to ease monetary conditions and is cajoling banks to lend
to small firms. It has just announced tax cuts that could reach
one percent of GDP next year.
    A weaker yuan would complement those efforts. Yet a
7-per-dollar yuan would erode faith in the China's stability and
provoke more U.S. ire. And coming on top of rising U.S. yields,
Brexit and Italian politics, it would add another layer of worry
to world markets.

    2/EUROPE'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE        
    Stock market turmoil, conflict over a contentious Italian
budget, high oil prices, sputtering economic growth -- not quite
the backdrop a central bank wants to see three months before its
 it ends its stimulus programme. 
    But that is exactly what the European Central Bank faces
when it meets on Thursday. For now, the heightened risks to the
growth outlook are not expected to derail its plans to end QE by
year-end, but the bank could downgrade the growth risk
assessment in its policy statement.
    That would be a dovish signal and one likely to cheer euro
zone bond markets which have been guided already to not expect a
rise in the ECB's record low rates until well into 2019. No
wonder then, that the gap between short-dated bond yields in the
United States and Germany are at their widest in 30 years, while
10-year euro area bond yields (with the exception of Italy) have
been largely insulated from the recent spike U.S. Treasury
yields.

    3/HOME RUN
    The U.S. housing market, the store of much of Americans'
wealth, has taken a leg down of late, against the backdrop of
the Federal Reserve's signals of another rate hike this year and
more in 2019. With rising borrowing costs and prices
outstripping wage growth, the market has been a weak spot in the
robust economy. So new homes sales data, due on Oct. 24, will be
closely scrutinized. 
    U.S. homebuilding dropped more than expected in September,
while mortgage activity was knocked in the latest week to its
lowest since 2014. The housing market has also been hobbled by
an acute shortage of properties for sale and higher home prices.
Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year
and the latest data supports economists' expectations that
housing remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

    4/APPROACHING JUNK 
    Moody's has just cut Italy's credit rating to within a notch
of 'junk' -- the sub-investment grade category below BBB-/Baa1
which is usually populated by the weaker emerging economies. On
Friday, S&P Global is likely to do the same, premising the move
on Italian plans to boost spending to boost growth and the
impact on a debt ratio that's already one of the world's worst.
    But Italy's debt is trading with yields that suggest
investors are pricing it as junk already. So the bigger risk
than a one-notch ratings downgrade has been that one or both of
the agencies set the outlook on Italy's rating to Negative,
instead of Stable. That would suggest a fall into junk is a real
possibility in the near future.
    Loss of investment grade carries a high cost -- hundreds of
billions of euros in fund flows and possibly even a fresh euro
zone crisis.
    Luckily for Italy, Moody's has held off doing that,
maintaining a steady outlook on the credit and providing a boost
to bonds and stocks. Many will be hoping S&P follows its lead.

    5/EUROPEAN AUTOS AND BANKS IN BEAR PIT
    European companies' Q3 earnings are a key test for a market
which according to EPFR Global, has seen investors pull out
almost $5 billion this week. Investors are jumpy about China's
economy, rising costs, trade wars, and lacklustre euro zone
growth.   
    The coming week sees Europe's most hated sectors -- autos
and banks -- reporting earnings. French carmakers Renault and
Peugeot will report figures. Coming after Daimler's profit
warning and negative outlooks from tyre maker Michelin and car
dealership Inchcape, these will be watched for signs of strain
from weaker car demand and higher trade tariffs.
    Results from UBS, Barclays, Nordea and the struggling
Deutsche Bank will give a read on how bad things are for the
banking sector.
    Analysts have slashed earnings forecasts for carmakers
consistently over the past six months – and have become 
increasingly pessimistic on banks' earnings since March. Shares
in both sectors are in bear territory, having fallen around 20
percent this year. 
    Earnings for MSCI Europe companies are seen growing more in
2019 than 2018, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows. And while earnings
expectations were relatively stable in 2017, pessimism over
Europe this year has led analysts to steadily downgrade their
forecasts.

the third quarter on a dip in car manufacturing but the drivers
of its recent expansion remain in place, so growth should
rebound in the final three months of the year, the Bundesbank
said on Monday.
    With the European Union implementing a new motor vehicle
emissions certification system, German auto makers struggled to
gain regulatory clearance while production was also dampened by
big dealership discounts to clear stock before the new rules
came into effect.
    Germany has been the engine of the euro zone's five-year
growth run and its recent wobbles have increased worries that
growth cycle may be coming to a premature end, before some
countries have had time to fully recover from the bloc's debt
crisis less than a decade ago.
    ""The economic upswing in Germany is still fundamentally
intact,"" the Bundesbank said in a regular monthly economic
report. 
    ""Business climate improved noticeably in the third quarter,
according to the Ifo Institute, so a significant expansion of
economic output is expected for the current quarter,"" the bank
added.
    Still, third quarter growth figures, due to be published in
mid-November, are likely to be sluggish as retail sales were
modest and construction output pulled back from earlier highs,
exacerbating the hit to growth from a big drop in industrial
production. 
    The car industry's struggles continued until the end of the
quarter but other segments of industry fared better and the
backlog of industrial orders also remained high, the Bundesbank
added.
    The German government recently cut its 2018 growth forecast
to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent and also lowered the 2019
projection to 1.8 percent from 2.1 percent, citing the impact of
global trade disputes, labour shortages and the auto sector’s
difficulties. [nL8N1WR30F]

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The euro failed to hold
early-session gains on Monday as investors focused on the
likelihood of further political uncertainty in Europe over
Italy's spending plans, despite a large drop in Italian
government borrowing costs.
    Rating agency Moody's downgraded the Italian credit rating
on Friday but unexpectedly kept the outlook at stable.
[nL3N1WZ5VO]
    That, along with more conciliatory comments from Italian
officials that they were ready to sit down with European Union
officials and did not intend to expand the deficit beyond 2019,
boosted demand for Italian debt after a weeks-long sell-off.
    But the euro, its fortunes increasingly linked this year to
Italian bond prices, failed to hold on to early gains and
dropped from $1.1550 to $1.1511, down 0.1 percent from the open.
[nL8N1WZ4VO] [nR1N1VZ02J]
    ""We have more conciliatory tones from both sides but it is
still clear that this dispute is not over yet,"" Commerzbank
analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    ""We are expecting volatile markets,"" she said, noting that
investors would be looking to Thursday's European Central Bank
monetary policy meeting to see whether, while unlikely, the bank
would comment on the dispute.
    Other analysts also said the euro remained at the mercy of
Italian developments, with a great deal of uncertainty ahead.
    ""... A full diary of risk events over the next two weeks and
little to argue in favour of support from the ECB in the near
future, the question remains over how far the yield gap can blow
out and how this could translate back into the FX market,"" BNY
Mellon chief currency strategist Simon Derrick said.
    The single currency was able to hold on to gains elsewhere,
rising 0.1 percent to 1.1474 Swiss francs <EURCHF=>, and 0.3
percent versus sterling to 88.300 pence <EURGBP=>.
    The dollar index rose 0.1 percent to 95.782 <.DXY>.
    
    CHINA BOOST
    Equity markets were mostly positive as hopes that China's
tax cuts next year could be worth more than one percent of gross
domestic product sparked a rally in Asian shares that fed across
to Europe. [nL3N1X21KG] [nL3N1X206H]
    That helped offset geopolitical concerns about the rift
between Saudi Arabia and the West over the killing of a
prominent critic of the kingdom, as well as worries about
Britain securing an exit deal with the EU.
    Although the more positive tone at the start of the week did
boost sentiment, forex markets were largely quiet. 
    The Australian dollar, which tends to benefit when China
sentiment improves because of its exposure to Chinese demand,
dropped 0.2 percent to $0.7105 <AUD=>. 
    Elsewhere, the dollar rose versus the Japanese yen <JPY=>.
The yen fetched 112.82, down 0.3 percent on the day and off a
one-month high of 111.61 touched on Oct. 15. Geopolitical
concerns helped it to benefit from its safe-haven status.
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> changed hands at C$1.3087, within
striking distance of a five-week low of C$1.3132 hit on Friday
on the back of weaker inflation and retail sales. [nL2N1WY1L4]

    SOFIA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Bulgaria will target a fiscal
deficit of 0.5 percent of economic output next year in
preparation for higher spending on wages, education and defence,
its budget draft showed on Monday.
    After initially targeting a fiscal deficit of 1 percent, the
European Union state is expected to end this year with a 
surplus of 0.5 percent mainly due to stronger-than-expected
revenues, the Finance Ministry draft showed.
    The draft is subject to government and parliamentary
approval.
    Under the plan, the Balkan country, which hopes to enter the
two-year obligatory waiting room for euro zone membership in
2019, plans to balance its budget as of 2020. 
    Bulgaria operates under a currency board regime that
requires its central bank to set interest rates and leaves
fiscal policy as the only tool to influence its economy.
    ""Key goals continue to be maintaining fiscal sustainability
and transparent and predictable fiscal policy,"" the draft said.
    Bulgaria ended 2017 with a fiscal surplus of 1.1 percent of
GDP, after initially targeting a deficit, spurring some
economists to say the finance ministry was lowering its revenue
projections so it could boast it had outperformed its targets.  
    Economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.7 percent
next year from 3.6 percent in 2018, with average annual
inflation rising to 3 percent in 2019.  
    The centre-right government plans to increase spending on  
public salaries by 10 percent, which will translate to a 20
percent hike for teachers' wages. Under the budget draft, state
pensions will also grow by an average of 5.7 percent from July.
    Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov has said he hopes the
private sector will follow suit and thus help boost living
standards in what is the poorest EU member state. [nL5N1VX2AX]  
  
    Sofia also plans to spend more for disabled and
disadvantaged people, and for defence as part of plans to meet a
NATO defence spending target of 2 percent of GDP by 2024 and buy

in 2017 amounted to 0.9 percent of gross domestic product, the
state statistics bureau said on Monday, slightly revising
upwards its figure from April when it said the surplus was 0.8
percent.
    The surplus amounted to 3.16 billion kuna ($488.73 million).
    It is the first time Croatia had recorded a budget surplus.
    The statistics bureau also said that Croatia's public debt
at the end of last year amounted to 77.5 percent of GDP, or
283.3 billion kuna, down from 80.2 percent a year before.
    Croatia wants to reduce its public debt towards 60 percent
of GDP in the coming years as the government said its goal was
for Croatia to adopt the euro in the next six to seven years.
    The conservative-led government, whose four-year term
expires in late 2020, wants Croatia to join the European
Exchange Mechanism (ERM-2) in early 2020, a tool for testing the
currency stability before joining the euro. Staying in ERM-2 is
necessary for at least two years.
    For this year the government plans a general budget deficit
of 0.5 percent.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The European Commission will
discuss and decide on Tuesday the next steps in the procedure
for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget, a Commission spokesman
said on Monday.
    The EU executive confirmed it had received a reply from
Italy on its budget by a Monday deadline, after the Commission

    If it did so, Italy would have three weeks to amend its
budgetary plans from the date of the Commission's rejection.
    The stand-off could be prolonged for weeks if the budget

    MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The turmoil in Italian asset
markets since May has forced Rome to tighten a state guarantee
scheme devised to help banks offload bad loans, making it
costlier for lenders, an EU Commission document showed.
    Regulators and investors see efforts to clean up bad loans
as crucial for the full recovery of the Italian banking sector,
which is again in the market's crosshairs due to the falling
value of its large sovereign bond holdings.
    Italy introduced the 'GACS' guarantee scheme in 2016 to help
banks tackle a 360 billion euro ($414 billion) pile of problem
loans left behind after a deep recession.
    The Commission on Aug. 31 granted a final six-month
extension to the scheme, which allows banks to buy a guarantee
from the state at market prices to ease sales of bad loans
repackaged as securities.
    The price of the guarantee reflects the cost of insuring
debt issued by a basket of Italian corporates and financials
against default, as measured by credit default swaps (CDS).
    However, CDS on Italy's debt <ITGV5YUSAC=MG> have nearly
tripled since mid May, when investors were spooked by the
prospect of a new anti-establishment coalition government with
profligate spending plans and anti-euro rhetoric.
    In approving the extension to the GACS scheme, the
Commission noted that such a sharp increase in CDS levels,
including a 40 percent rise on one day, was a very rare event.
    ""The fact that CDS premiums have not eased considerably
since then could be interpreted as a ... change in the market,
representing a fundamental reassessment of risks inherent to
Italy,"" the Commission said. 
    To avoid breaching EU state aid rules when seeking the
renewal, Italy proposed calculating the CDS average, which is
used to price the GACS, over a period of two months, instead of
the six months used previously, when the difference between the
two calculations exceeds a certain threshold.
    The shortening of the calculation period prevents Italian
banks from benefiting from the lower CDS levels before the
market sell-off. 
    A person working on a bad loan sale said the changes
translated into lower prices for the bad loan portfolios being
sold and hence larger losses for banks, stymieing the bad loan
market.
    After a slow start due to the patchy state of Italian banks'
loan records and its own complexity, the GACS scheme has been a
key contributor to banks' bad debt sales. 
    Bad loans are normally sold at a loss and the hit to banks'
capital limits the amount of these assets lenders can offload.
    The guarantee wraps the least risky notes in bad loan
securitisation issues, reducing the overall financing cost of
the transaction, helping banks achieve a better price. 
    Italian banks had cut their pile of impaired debt to 264
billion euros by the end of last year, according to consultancy
PwC. 
    Bailed-out Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> has tapped the GACS
scheme in a record 24 billion euro bad loan securitisation.
UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, Creval <PCVI.MI>, Carige <CRGI.MI> are
among other banks that have used the guarantee.

to maintain growth due to solid demand for its main exports
despite increasing global risks and mounting inflationary
pressures linked to higher oil prices, the Bank of Slovenia said
in a report on Monday.
    Slovenia, which only narrowly avoided an international
bailout for its banks in 2013, returned to growth a year later
and the government sees economic expansion of 4.4 percent this
year and 3.7 percent in 2019. It grew 4.9 percent in 2017.
    ""The latest ... forecasts of economic growth of Slovenia's
main trading partners indicate a solid rise of foreign demand
for the products of the Slovenian exports sector,"" the central
bank report said.
    Slovenia exports more than 65 percent of its production,
mainly to other European Union states. Main exports include
cars, car parts, pharmaceutical products and household
appliances.
    The monetary authority report cautioned, however, that
growth in investment by local companies was moderate due to
global uncertainties including trade conflicts, weak currencies
in some emerging market nations and Italy's public finance
problems.
    The bank urged the Slovenian government to keep a lid on
public spending as public debt remains high, expected to reach
70.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2018 versus 74.1 percent last
year. 
    It also highlighted persistent low labour productivity in
Slovenia, rising by only 1.9 percent on average over the past
two years and by only 1 percent in the first half of 2018.

Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission will
discuss Italy's budget plans at its meeting later today, with
some in the Italian government expecting it will take the
unprecedented step of rejecting the plan and demanding changes.
Italy's bond yields have ticked up this morning ahead of the
meeting, but whatever happens in the weeks ahead, some are
already trying to take the drama out of the stand-off. Mario
Centeno, the Portuguese head of the Eurogroup of eurozone
finance ministers, says he is confident that agreement can
ultimately be reached. Italy told the Commission on Monday it
would stick to its contested 2019 budget plans in defiance of
European Union fiscal rules, but promised not to inflate its
deficit any further in the years ahead. Centeno told Reuters
that while Rome had to stick to the rules, ""we also don't need
to be dramatic"". He pointed to his own Socialist government in
Portugal as an example of an administration that won the
confidence of markets and investors after it made clear it
intended to stick to European budget rules after coming to power
in 2015. Whether or not fiscal conservatives in Germany and
elsewhere agree with him, is perhaps another matter.
    UK Prime Minister Theresa May holds a cabinet meeting today
in a slightly less fragile position than she was in 72 hours
ago. The furore over nasty, anonymous quotes in weekend media
attributed to pro-Brexit party critics demanding her political
""assassination"" has helped undermine their rebellion plot: it
seems she has not been summoned to face angry lawmakers at the
powerful 1922 committee this week, and a series of amendments
aimed at making Brexit talks even harder have been withdrawn.
The hard Brexiteers may have also judged that parliamentary
arithmetic remains against them at this stage - both for their
planned amendments and any future leadership challenge to May.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
    The attempted rally in world markets on Monday has
evaporated quickly. Optimism about a fiscal boost in China and
relief over Moody’s outlook on Italy only offered a brief
respite against the backdrop of trade-related economic drags, a
high bar on corporate earnings projections and gnawing political
concerns from the U.S. mid-term elections, Saudi Arabia’s rift
with Western powers and the Brexit-inspired threats to the
position of UK PM May. The S&P500 fell for the fourth straight
day on Monday, losing 0.4 percent in its 11th daily drop in 13
trading days. MSCI's all-country index was down for the fifth
consecutive day on Tuesday. While aggregate Q3 earnings growth
is expected to come in just over 20 percent again, much is
already in the price and there are nerves about the hit to
industrials and tech from rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
Halliburton dropped 3 percent on Monday after warning about
difficulty in the U.S. fracking market and Caterpillar is due
out later. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all report later in
the week.  Volatility gauges remained elevated with the Vix
index nudging back up to 20 percent. 
    The overall damage to risk sentiment filtered through Asia,
with Chinese, Japanese and South Korean equity benchmarks all
losing more than 2 percent. The darkened mood lifted the dollar
more broadly, with perceived currency havens such as the yen and
Swiss franc outperforming again. Sterling was back below $1.30
for the first time in more than two weeks amid doubts about PM
May’s ability to sell a Brexit deal to her own Conservative
Party and their Northern Irish partners the Democratic Unionist
Party. More broadly, there’s growing concern that with many
global equity indices in technical ‘bear market’ territory
already this year, we are entering a period of selling rallies
rather than buying dips. Rather than some big bubble burst that
many have feared for years, the air is already gradually seeping
out of this bull market and the funk could persist for many
months if not years. European and U.S. stock futures were down
more than 1 percent first thing. European shares are set to
touch levels not seen for two years as Q3 earnings stream in.
    Italian yields pushed back higher after a relief rally in
BTPs on Monday when credit rating firms Moody’s lifted its
sovereign credit outlook to stable after cutting the rating to
one notch above junk. The European Commission is due to decide
on Tuesday its next steps with regard to Rome’s controversial
deficit-expanding budget. The Italian government said it would
stand firm and explain its case thoroughly, but daily newspaper
Il Messaggero reported on Tuesday that the coalition is prepared
to adjust measures in its contested 2019 budget should markets
react negatively and the yield spread between compared to
Germany spike. Eurogroup head Centeno told Reuters late Monday
he was confident an agreement between Brussels and Rome would be
reached and initial soundings were “very positive” from both
sides.
    In corporate news, plenty of third-quarter earnings. Swedish
defence firm Saab was down 15 percent as after its earnings and
as it announced a $665 million rights issue to bolster its
balance sheet. Renault announced revenues fell 6 percent. In
another bearish sector, banking, Swedbank net profit beat
forecast. It’s not looking good for money manager GAM which is
seeing an asset exodus.  Other bellwethers for the region
include Dutch staffing Randstad, Good earnings in tech lifted
the Nasdaq on Monday and it is yet to be seen if the sector can
lift Europe too. Computer accessory firm Logitech confirmed its
2019 outlook after rising sales while France’s Atos and Ingenico
lowered their outlooks. Innate Pharma may also get a boost after

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month
low on Tuesday before a meeting by the European Commission on
Italy's budget that could see Brussels take the unprecedented
step of rejecting it and demanding changes.
    A dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the
leadership of Britain's prime minister, mired in a stalemate
over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the likelihood of
further political turmoil in Europe. 
    That contributed to broad risk aversion on Tuesday, with the
safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening while
higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell.
    Worries about Italy's spending has bred some doubt about the
European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates next summer
and that has hurt the euro. On Tuesday,it fell 0.2 percent to
$1.4390, nearing a two-month low of $1.4325 hit on Oct. 9.
<EUR=EBS>  
    Italy's bond yields ticked up on Tuesday before the meeting.
Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance
ministers, said on Monday he was confident an agreement could be
reached.
    ""The prospect of a normalisation of monetary policy was the
main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past
year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now
going to crumble,"" Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    Tensions are likely to heighten between Rome and Brussels,
especially if the European Council launch an ""Excessive Deficit
Procedure"" against Italy, said Philip Wee, currency strategist
at DBS in a note.
    ""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective
action to rein in its large public debt, currently at 130
percent of GDP vs the 60 percent Maastricht rule,"" Wee said.
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against six
other major currencies, rose to a two-month high of 96.158 and
traded up 0.1 percent. 
    That was due to the turbulence in Europe continent and
expectations that a strong U.S. economy may see the Federal
Reserve raise rates faster than assumed. 
    Britain's pound traded up 0.2 percent at $1.3 after falling
on Monday on fears that the Irish border issue and disagreements
within Britain's ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see
Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge.
[nL8N1X2283] 
    ""Whispers of a growing number of Tory MP rebels losing their
patience with May have put the risks of a lengthy UK political
impasse and a Brexit policy mistake (exiting the EU without a
deal) back on the table,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency
strategist at ING.
    ""We think this noise is likely to keep the pound on the back
foot this week,"" he said.
    The dollar weakened 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen
<JPY=D3> to trade at 112.32 yen, gaining as risk-shy investors
retreated from Asia's main share markets. [nL3N1X3077]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=D3> lost 0.1 percent versus the
U.S. dollar on Tuesday, changing hands at 0.7089. It lost 0.6
percent on Monday.

with the view of raising 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in

    The government is looking for ways to finance its
expansionary 2019 budget and is targeting the financial sector
to raise money.
    The source said the spreading of the deferred tax assets was
meant to replace another measure the government was considering,

    By Marc Jones
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - An ugly start to European trading
pushed world shares towards their lowest level in a year on
Tuesday, as negative drivers from Saudi Arabia's diplomatic
isolation to worries about Italy's finances and trade wars piled
on the pressure.
     Selling escalated from Wall Street [.N] into a heavy
selloff in Asia [.SS][.T] before hitting Europe, which was
facing a fifth day of uninterrupted declines. [.EU]
     The tech sector <.SX8P> posted the worst performance after
chipmaker AMS <AMS.S> plunged 17 percent as its outlook
triggered alarm bells, but there was a broader force at play.
     The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was near a two-year low
with almost half of its stocks now in bear-market territory --
down 20 percent from their peak. 
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> also fell to late 2016 lows, London's
FTSE <.FTSE> was down near April lows, and MSCI's world share
index <.MIWD00000PUS> was just two points of a one-year low.
    ""This morning weaker stocks in Asia raised some eyebrows and
overall sentiment is suffering from trade tensions, Italy to
Brexit; a concoction of concerns,"" said ING strategist Benjamin
Schroeder.
    The euro also fell towards a two-month low [/FRX] and
Italian bonds struggled before a European Commission meeting
that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of demanding
changes to Italy's recently laid out budget plans. [GVD/EUR]    
    That has bred some doubt about the European Central Bank
raising interest rates next summer, leaving the euro at $1.4390
<EUR=EBS>. Doubts about Britain's prime minister, mired in a
stalemate over Brexit, kept the pressure on sterling. <GBP=D4>
    All that contributed to the risk-averse mood, with the
safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening while
higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell. [/FRX]
    ""The prospect of a normalisation of (ECB) monetary policy
was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the
past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is
now going to crumble,"" Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    
    SAUDI TENSIONS
    Markets were also waiting for Turkey's president to reveal
his country's take on the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist
Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month.
    Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil exporter, faces international
pressure to provide all the facts about an incident that has
raised a global storm and added the threat of sanctions against
the kingdom to a list of market concerns.
    U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not
satisfied with what he had heard from Saudi Arabia about the
killing, but expressed reluctance to punish the kingdom
economically. [nL8N1X24DL]
    Investors worry that may lead to Saudi retaliation through
crude oil, although a Saudi pledge to play a ""responsible role""
and keep markets supplied held down crude prices on Tuesday.
[O/R]
    Front-month Brent crude oil futures <LCOc1> were at $79.51 a
barrel, down 0.4 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude futures <CLc1> were at $69.12 a barrel, dropping 0.35
percent.
    Asia's overnight tumble gave back some of the ground the
region had clawed back over the last two sessions.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares <.MIAP00000PUS>
dropped 2 percent to a 1 1/2-year low, with declines in many of
the region's heavyweight bourses even more pronounced.
    South Korea's Kospi <.KS11> and Hong Kong's Hang Seng <.HSI>
both fell 3 percent and Japan's Nikkei <.N225> lost 2.7 percent.
    ""We've got a few negative factors when market sentiment was
already fragile,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. ""And earnings from some
Japanese companies were weaker than expected, with some starting
to blame trade wars.""
    The yen <JPY=> gained 0.4 percent amid the risk-off mood to
112.42 to the dollar.
    The yuan was little changed but stood near Monday's 21-month
low of 6.9445 per dollar in the onshore trade <CNY=CFXS> on
expectations China will pursue looser monetary policy to cope
with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on tariffs.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday before a
meeting of the European Commission on Italy's budget that could
see Brussels take the unprecedented step of rejecting it and
demanding changes.
    The dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the
leadership of Britain's prime minister who is mired in a
stalemate over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the
likelihood of further political turmoil in Europe. 
    Broad risk aversion pervaded currency markets on Tuesday,
with the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening,
while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New
Zealand dollars fell.
    Worries about Italy's spending has bred some doubt about the
European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates next summer
and that has hurt the euro. But on Tuesday, it rose 0.2 percent
to $1.1486. <EUR=EBS>  
    Italy's bond yields fell on Tuesday before the European
Commission's meeting. Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup
of eurozone finance ministers, said on Monday he was confident
an agreement could be reached.
    ""The prospect of a normalisation of monetary policy was the
main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past
year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now
going to crumble,"" Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    Tensions are likely to rise further between Rome and
Brussels, especially if the European Council launch an
""Excessive Deficit Procedure"" against Italy, said Philip Wee,
currency strategist at DBS in a note.
    ""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective
action to rein in its large public debt,"" Wee said.
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against six
other major currencies, fell 0.2 percent after earlier reaching
a two-month high of 96.158. 
    Turbulence in Europe has lifted the dollar recently along
with expectations that a strong U.S. economy may see the Federal
Reserve raise rates faster than assumed. 
    Britain's pound traded up 0.2 percent at $1.30 after falling
on Monday on fears that the Irish border issue and disagreements
within Britain's ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see
Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge.
[nL8N1X2283] 
    ""Whispers of a growing number of Tory MP rebels losing their
patience with May have put the risks of a lengthy UK political
impasse and a Brexit policy mistake (exiting the EU without a
deal) back on the table,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency
strategist at ING.
    ""We think this noise is likely to keep the pound on the back
foot this week,"" he said.
    The dollar weakened half a percent against the Japanese yen
<JPY=D3> to trade at 112.32 yen as risk-shy investors retreated
from Asia's main share markets. [nL3N1X3077]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=D3> lost 0.1 percent versus the
U.S. dollar on Tuesday, changing hands at 0.7089. It lost 0.6
percent on Monday.

 (Adds details, context)
    By Francesco Guarascio
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The head of the euro zone's
rescue fund said on Tuesday that Italy's free-spending fiscal
plans were a risk that was troubling domestic banks, but
cautioned against panic because contagion to other countries had
been ""very limited"".
    Italy's draft 2019 budget targets a deficit of 2.4 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP), which is far above commitments
made by the previous government and risks increasing the
country's huge public debt pile in breach of EU fiscal rules.  
    ""There is a risk with Italy. We are worried about Italy
because the fiscal plans are not compatible with the EU fiscal
framework,"" Klaus Regling told a news conference in Luxembourg.
     His comments came hours before the EU Commission discusses
the next steps to take on a procedure that could lead to an
unprecedented rejection of the Italian budget plan and, in the
longer-term, to fines.
    Regling, who chairs the Luxembourg-based European Stability
Mechanism (ESM) rescue fund, stressed Italy's debt problems were
different from those of Greece, which needed three euro zone
bailouts over the last decade.
    ""One should not really get into panic here,"" Regling said,
listing the differences between Italy's current situation and
Greece's long crisis.
    He said Italy's fundamentals were much more solid as the
country had only a limited nominal deficit and a current account
surplus, adding that its debt had a relatively long average
maturity which helped shield the country from market pressure.
        
    BANK WOES
    Regling warned, however, about the risks faced by the
Italian banking sector due to higher yields on government debt,
which reduce the value of lenders' large holdings of Italian
bonds and could force recapitalisations. 
    Since budgetary plans were agreed by Italy's eurosceptic
government this month, the nation's funding costs have spiked
and the gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yield
spreads briefly reached its widest level in 5-1/2 years. 
    ""It's sad what is happening to the Italian banks now because
they were on a good way,"" Regling said, citing the rapid
reduction of bad loans in banks' balance sheets and banking
reforms over the last two years as positive developments.
    ""There was quite a positive trend. Now they suffer from the
deterioration in the sovereign debt and that spills over very
automatically. So that makes their life complicated again,"" he
said.
    Asked whether Italy should consider asking for ESM financial
support for its banks as Spain did in 2012, Regling said the
current situation was different due to stricter rules on EU
banking and state aid.
    ""I would not recommend at the moment to go the same way (as
Spain did),"" Regling said.
    Although Italy's debt woes have already spilled into the
domestic banking system, Regling said there has been so far
""very limited contagion"" to other euro zone countries.
    He added that ""one or two"" Greek banks had suffered due to
contagion from Italy, but said their problems were also caused
by very high levels of bad debt. He did not name the lenders.

rescue fund said on Tuesday Greece had no urgent need to issue
new debt for the coming two years but urged a gradual approach
with a possible new issuance when sovereign yields drop from
current levels.
    Greece exited its third bailout in a decade in August. As
part of the financial programme, euro zone lenders gave Greece a
last tranche of loans worth 15 billion euros ($17.19 billion) to
bolster a cash buffer against market pressure for a couple of
years.   
   As a consequence of that deal, ""now there is no urgent need 
for them to go to the markets,"" Klaus Regling, who chairs the
European Stability Mechanism rescue fund, told a news
conference. 
   He said the Greek cash buffer now stood at 22 billion euros,
which meant that ""they don't need to go to the markets for two
years.""
    However, he added that Greece's full return to market
financing should happen gradually with a possible new issuance
before 2020 following two ""quite successful"" auctions last year.
 
    ""The secondary market's yields are higher than they were six
months ago. I would expect when secondary market yields come
down again they (the Greek authorities) will do it,"" Regling
said.
     The head of the rescue fund underlined that it was a
decision that Greece would make on its own while taking into
account national and international developments.
    ""I am confident they will do the right thing,"" he told
reporters.

    By Marc Jones
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - World shares slid towards their
lowest level in a year on Tuesday, as negative drivers from
fatigued earnings and Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to a
brewing spat over Italy's finances piled on the pressure.
     Wall Street looked set to for another jolt lower when it
reopens [.N] but it was heavy selloffs in both Asia and Europe
[.SS][.T], which was heading for a fifth day of uninterrupted
falls, that did the main damage. [.EU]
     The tech sector <.SX8P> posted the worst performance after
Swiss-listed chipmaker AMS <AMS.S> plunged 25 percent as its
outlook triggered alarm bells [nL8N1X25PX], but there was a
broader force at play.
     The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was near a two-year low
with almost half of its stocks now in bear-market territory --
down 20 percent from their peak. 
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> dropped to late 2016 lows, MSCI's
world share index <.MIWD00000PUS> was just two points of a
one-year low while Wall Street's S&P 500 was set to test the
lower limits of its 200-day moving average again. [.N]
    ""This is quite an important period now because we have tried
to rally a few times and haven't really managed it,"" said
Natwest Markets' head of global strategy James McCormick.
    There has been a spike in U.S. bond yields similar to
earlier in the year, ""but the macro picture for equities is more
challenging now,"" he added, pointing to fading synchronization
in global growth as well a stronger dollar.
    That strength kept the euro pinned near a two-month low at
at $1.146 <EUR=EBS>[/FRX] before a European Commission meeting
that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of demanding
changes to Italy's recently laid out budget plans. [GVD/EUR]    
    Italian bond traders were biding their time amid reports of
some conciliatory moves from Rome's coalition but the spat has
also bred doubts about the European Central Bank plans to
possibly raise its interest rates next year.
    Questions about the future of Britain's prime minister,
mired in a stalemate over Brexit, relented just a enough to help
sterling claw higher <GBP=D4> but the mood remained distinctly
'risk off' regardless. 
    That helped strengthen the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss
franc while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and
New Zealand dollars fell. [/FRX]
    ""The prospect of a normalisation of (ECB) monetary policy
was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the
past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is
now going to crumble,"" Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    
    SAUDI TENSIONS
    U.S. stock index futures were pointing to a more than 1
percent fall for Wall Streets main markets later. Digger maker
Caterpillar's <CAT.N> shares fell 5.4 percent in premarket moves
after it blamed U.S. tariffs for rising costs, while 3M <MMM.N>
slumped 7 percent after missing analysts estimates. [.N]
    Markets were also digesting Turkish President Tayyip
Erdogan's comments on the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist
Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month.
    ""Intelligence and security institutions have evidence
showing the murder was planned.... Pinning such a case on some
security and intelligence members will not satisfy us or the
international community,"" Erdogan told Turkey's parliament,
though he did not reveal a smoking gun in the form of recordings
that some reports had hinted at. [nL8N1X339E]
    Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil exporter, faces international
pressure to provide all the facts about an incident that has
raised a global storm and added the threat of sanctions against
the kingdom to a list of market concerns.
    U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not
satisfied with what he had heard from Saudi Arabia about the
killing, but expressed reluctance to punish the kingdom
economically. [nL8N1X24DL]
    Investors worry that may lead to Saudi retaliation through
crude oil, although a Saudi pledge to play a ""responsible role""
and keep markets supplied held down crude prices on Tuesday.
[O/R]
    Front-month Brent crude oil futures <LCOc1> were at $79.51 a
barrel, down 0.4 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude futures <CLc1> were at $69.12 a barrel, dropping 0.35
percent.
    Asia's overnight tumble gave back some of the ground the
region had clawed back over the last two sessions.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares <.MIAP00000PUS>
dropped 2 percent to a 1 1/2-year low, with declines in many of
the region's heavyweight bourses even more pronounced.
    South Korea's Kospi <.KS11> and Hong Kong's Hang Seng <.HSI>
both fell 3 percent and Japan's Nikkei <.N225> lost 2.7 percent.
    ""We've got a few negative factors when market sentiment was
already fragile,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. ""And earnings from some
Japanese companies were weaker than expected, with some starting
to blame trade wars.""
    The yen <JPY=> gained 0.4 percent amid the risk-off mood to
112.42 to the dollar.
    The yuan was little changed but stood near Monday's 21-month
low of 6.9445 per dollar in the onshore trade <CNY=CFXS> on
expectations China will pursue looser monetary policy to cope
with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on tariffs.

decided on Tuesday to keep its countercyclical capital buffer at
1.50 percent, a level banks will have to meet from next August
to boost the sector's resilience after fast loan growth.
    Slovakia became the first euro zone country two years ago to
first introduce the buffer, imposing a rate of 0.5 percent that
came into effect last year. The buffer rate rose to 1.25 percent
in August 2018. [nP7N1Q301D]

recent years.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - A row between the eurosceptic
Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget has escalated with the EU Commission's decision on Oct.
23 to reject Italian budgetary plans for next year.
    The unprecedented move has formally opened a legal dispute
that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy until it is
resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but had not previously been applied to any
member of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to cutting its structural deficit by
0.6 points in 2019. But the government's new plans foresee
instead a rise in the structural deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP.
The structural balance excludes one-off expenditures, for
emergencies or natural catastrophes.
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of more than 130 percent of GDP, which should instead
fall, under EU rules.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the procedure and
of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
monthly meeting which is likely to put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 8: The Commission publishes its economic forecasts,
which would show whether EU calculations match Italy's growth,
debt and deficit projections underpinning its budget targets.
The data could pave the way to sanction procedures if EU and
Italian data differ widely.
    
    Nov. 13: Italy has three weeks from the date of the EU
decision to submit a revised budget. That sets a Nov. 13
deadline.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 4: The Commission would have three weeks from the
submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt a new opinion in
which it would describe Italy's overall budgetary position and
its impact on the whole euro zone. This deadline would expire on
Dec. 4 if Italy revised its budget on the last available day
allowed by the procedure. 
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission publishes its
new economic forecasts.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines.
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just a
few weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - In the end it was Theresa May who
asked to address her restive Conservative Party lawmakers at a
private meeting today rather than being ""summoned"" to hear their
complaints about her Brexit handling. That would suggest the
meeting is likely to be less awkward for her than first imagined
- even possibly allowing her to argue afterwards there was an
expression of loyalty towards her. The encounter comes amid
local media leaks of government planning for some of the most
extreme Brexit outcomes. On the one hand, The Times cites
documents drawn up by her chief Europe adviser which speak of a
""long-running implementation period"" (i.e transition phase) that
could be rolled over on an annual basis if needed - effectively
leaving the UK in an open-ended Norway-style relationship with
the EU. At the other extreme, the FT reports that plans were
discussed at a stormy cabinet meeting for Britain to charter
ships to ferry in critical food and medicines in the event of a
""no-deal"" Brexit.
    NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will be pushed at a
briefing this morning to respond to Donald Trump's plans to
withdraw from a 1987 treaty limiting arms in Europe. The move,
which came largely out of the blue but was confirmed by his
adviser John Bolton in Moscow last night, has created much
anxiety within NATO. Some in the alliance see it as the latest
example of the split between the Trump White House and the rest
of the US administration. More widely it is evidence of Trump
abandoning a core piece of NATO policy in a unilateral fashion.
Germany has said it will fight the proposal using all diplomatic
channels possible: the battle starts when Washington's NATO
ambassador presents the plan to fellow alliance envoys in
Brussels on Thursday.
    European capitals will be closely watching Italian PM
Giuseppe Conte's talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. Rome
is a firm critic of existing EU sanctions on Russia put in place
after its Crimea annexation but has not yet stated whether it
would veto fresh ones over, for example, the Skripal poisoning.
How or whether Rome uses that issue in leverage over its budget
stand-off with Brussels remains to be seen.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    A late rally for Wall St stock indices on Tuesday has helped
take the edge off an increasingly anxious mood on world markets
but the S&P still ended down for the 5th straight day, losing
more than half a percent. Although the rally from five-month
lows eased some nerves, the index failed to recapture its
200-day moving average and remains on course for its worst month
since at least August 2015. Peak-to-trough losses in October
were as much as 8.5 percent at one point yesterday. Earnings
season angst and worries about deteriorating corporate guidance
despite decent third quarter bottom lines has been one of main
drivers of the selloff this week, with markets wary of outlooks
from big industrial stocks such as Halliburton and Caterpillar
and fearful that rising trade tensions between the United States
and China will start to hit the big tech firms too. Caterpillar
stock dropped almost 8 percent on Tuesday after just failing to
lift its full-year 2018 steer for the first time in three
quarters. Microsoft will be the mostly closely watched update
later on Wednesday after the market closes. Global markets were
steadier overnight, with Chinese and Japanese equity benchmarks
eking out small gains and the MSCI all-country index flat for
the day so far, but at risk of recording its 6th straight daily
loss after hitting its lowest in more than year on Tuesday.
    European stocks futures opened up about half a percent amid
a deluge of earnings on this side of the pond and with the banks
in focus. But S&P futures were still in the red overnight and
10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped to 3.14 percent, with the
2-10-year yield curve flattening to its lowest in about three
weeks. Apart from earnings jitters, more general fears of ebbing
world growth amid escalating trade wars and
economically-sensitive political tensions from Saudi Arabia to
Italy and Brexit are enough to keep investors worried. Global
flash manufacturing business surveys for October out through the
day will be another key sounding on confidence. French
industrial confidence fell to its lowest reading in almost two
years this month, early PMI readings showed. A combination of
global demand concerns and Saudi commitments to keep supplies
buoyed enough to offset the loss of embargoed Iranian crude has
dragged Brent crude oil prices to its lowest in a month this
week but it hovered just above $76 per barrel first thing. 
    In currency markets, the safe-haven yen gave up much of
Tuesday’s gains against the dollar and the greenback was a touch
firmer more broadly. Sterling was off a fraction as markets eye
UK PM May’s meeting with backbenchers from her own ruling
Conservative party later today amid concerns about a leadership
challenge. Italian 10-year government bond yields were steady
below the week’s highs, with markets eyeing the next steps after
the European Commission on Tuesday asked Italy to resubmit its
draft budget with lower deficit targets.  Deputy PM Salvini
insisted again early on Wednesday that there would be no
changes, but also stressed Italy did not want to leave the euro
or European Union.
    In European corporate news, it’s a big days for banking
shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe.
Deutsche Bank stock lost almost 3 percent after announced a
steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track
to swing to a profit this year. Nordea also had a weak quarter
and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity.
Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned to cut at least 1,600
jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter
operating profit slightly above market expectations. In the UK,
Barclays  reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as
its under-pressure investment banking division booked increased
trading revenues despite difficult market conditions. Still in
financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose.

companies accelerated to yet another post-crisis high in
September, the European Central Bank said on Wednesday.
    Lending growth to corporations expanded by 4.3 percent last
month after 4.1 percent in September, its highest since
mid-2009, while household lending growth held steady at a
post-crisis high of 3.1 percent. 
    Purchasing 2.6 trillion euros worth of debt over nearly four
years, the ECB has held down borrowing costs to stimulate
lending and rekindle growth and inflation.
    While its efforts have mostly paid off, economic growth has
softened this year and underlying inflation remains stubbornly
low. 
    Still, with unemployment dropping and the threat of
deflation warded off, the ECB remains on course to end its bond
purchases this year and raise rates for the first time since
2011 sometime next autumn, satisfied that inflation will
continue to rise even with reduced support.
    The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply,
which in part reflects the amount of cash pumped in by the ECB
itself, pick up to 3.5 percent from 3.4 percent a month earlier,
in line with expectations for 3.5 percent.
    The ECB will next meet on Thursday and while it is all but
certain to keep policy unchanged, it is expected to discuss a
marked deterioration in the growth outlook.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 24: Fitch Ratings says ECB purchases of Eurozone 
sovereign debt have far outweighed net issuance since 2015, raising the risk of 
increased bond market volatility as quantitative easing (QE) comes to an end. QE 
purchases by the ECB have played a key role in absorbing the increase in 
Eurozone government debt since the beginning of 2015 and their scheduled 
termination in December 2018 will require private sector investors to fill the 
gap. 

The scale of the forthcoming shift in market conditions is highlighted by the 
latest chart of the month from Fitch's economics team, which shows the 
cumulative increase in the stock of government debt securities since the end of 
2014 broken down by type of creditor: the central bank, other domestic creditors 
(including financial institutions) and non-residents. It shows that QE has more 
than covered the increase in sovereign debt during the QE period by a factor of 
1.5 in Italy, France and Spain, while in Germany QE purchases have accompanied a 
fall in the overall stock of debt outstanding.

scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" 
allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

The cumulative purchases made by the central banks of Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain have, in aggregate, amounted to almost 3 times as much as the increase in 
those four countries' aggregate stock of debt since the end of 2014. The 
corollary of this has been a reduction in holdings by other domestic investors 
and (with the exception of Spain) by non-residents. 

Central banks' share of total government debt has increased manifold since the 
start of QE, with the largest being in Germany; the increase in the Bundesbank 
share has been 16pp since the start of QE. The Bank of Italy's share of 
government debt today stands at close to 20% after an increase of 14pp. 

ECB QE has likely played a significant part in the compression of global yields 
(see our August's chart of the month), but the impact on Eurozone bond yields 
has been more powerful and direct. Arguably the QE 'distortion' to German yields 
has been the strongest given shrinking aggregate supply, raising the risk of 
higher Bund yields when QE ends. But bond spreads over Bunds could also see 
upward pressure as the search for yield unwinds and net issuance remains 
positive.

 (Adds comment, details)
    By Jonathan Cable
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth slowed
much faster than expected this month, dragged down by waning
orders that put a big dent in confidence, adding to evidence the
bloc's halcyon days are behind it for now, a survey showed.
    October's disappointing survey is likely to concern
policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are expected to
end their bond-buying programme in less than three months,
despite a slew of political and trade concerns. [ECILT/EU]
    The economic slowdown comes amid an escalating trade war
between the United States and China, a spiraling debt dispute in
Italy, deadlocked Brexit negotiations and the prospect of
steadily tightening financial conditions. 
    Both the euro <EUR=> and euro zone government bond yields
dropped on Wednesday after the survey's release, with the single
currency falling half a percent to $1.1417, its lowest since
Aug. 20. [nL8N1X429V]
    Markets have taken a battering recently and European stocks
<.STOXX> were trading near a two-year low on Tuesday, down 20
percent from their peak, but the index rose 0.6 percent on
Wednesday. [MKTS/GLOB]
    ""The euro area economy is clearly suffering from the
uncertainty created by the trade war and weaker global growth
momentum, and the weakness is spreading to the domestic
economy,"" said Jan von Gerich at Nordea. ""The weak PMI data
clearly increase downside risks to the euro area growth
outlook.""
    Indeed, the outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for
the first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who
are also concerned about the U.S.-China trade war and have
repeatedly said euro zone growth is well past its peak.
[ECILT/WRAP]
    ECB policymakers have slowly trimmed asset purchases, hoping
they have done enough to bolster growth and inflation and are
expected to hold policy steady on Thursday - despite evidence
euro zone growth momentum peaked some time ago.
    ""Amid the fiscal stand-off between Rome and Brussels as well
as increasingly jittery global markets, the ECB is likely to
stress caution,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
    IHS Markit said if the survey levels were maintained, they
pointed to fourth quarter growth of 0.3 percent. That would be
the slowest pace in 2 1/2 years and below the 0.4 percent
predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month.
    Earlier figures from Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
showed private-sector growth slowed to its weakest in more than
three years as manufacturing and services both lost momentum.
[nL9N1T2013]
    Germany's Chambers of Industry and Commerce, DIHK, last week
cut its 2018 growth forecast and predicted a slowdown next year
as the country faces mounting risks at home and abroad. It
predicted 2019 growth of 1.7 percent, below a Reuters poll
forecast of 1.8 percent. [nL8N1WY1Z8]
    However, it was a different story in France, the bloc's
second-biggest economy. Its growth accelerated as strength in
services offset weakness in manufacturing. [nL9N1T2012]

    ACROSS THE BOARD
    IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for
the euro zone tumbled to a 25-month low of 52.7 from a final
September reading of 54.1, significantly below the median
expectation in a Reuters poll for a modest dip to 53.9. The
lowest forecast was for 53.2.
    Anything above 50 in the survey, which is regarded as a good
guide to economic health, indicates growth.
    Suggesting companies don't expect a rebound anytime soon,
the future output index, which gauges optimism, fell to a near
four-year low of 59.4. A similar reading from manufacturers fell
to a level not seen in almost six years.
    Manufacturers suffered a similar fate with their PMI sinking
to 52.1 from 53.2, missing a median prediction for 53.0, as
factory orders contracted for the first time since late-2014.
    An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite
PMI, dropped to 51.2 from 52.7. It hasn't been lower since the
end of 2014.
    A similar gloomier picture emerged for the bloc's dominant
service industry. The services PMI plummeted to a two-year low
of 53.3 from September's 54.7, also far short of all forecasts
in a Reuters poll.
    In a further sign of a dimming outlook, the services
employment index - a lagging indicator, also fell.

    By Stefano Bernabei
    ROME, Oct 24 (Reuters) - European lawmakers have
short-listed Italy's Andrea Enria and Ireland's Sharon Donnery
to be the next head of the EU's banking supervisory body, two
sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.
    Enria is chairman of the European Banking Authority while
Donnery is the Irish deputy central bank chief.
    The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs
Committee held a closed-door hearing in Strasbourg on Tuesday to
assess three candidates who had put themselves forward to take
charge of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). 
    They subsequently passed on the names of Enria and Donnery
to the European Central Bank, which takes the decision, the
sources said. French financial markets regulator Robert Ophele
was the third candidate, sources told Reuters last month.
    The 25-member governing council of the ECB is expected to
hold a secret ballot on the nomination at a Nov. 7 meeting.
    Enria was not backed by the Italian ruling League party's
representative within the European Parliament, the sources said.
    ""The League was very critical about Enria's position against
banking rules for easing credit criteria to small and
medium-sized businesses,"" one of the sources said, asking not to
be identified since the procedure is not public.
    According to the second source, EU lawmakers underlined
Enria's international experience in its letter to ECB President
Mario Draghi. They said Donnery would offer a better gender
balance among top EU jobs.
    Donnery has been seen for weeks as the favourite as she is
expected to enjoy German support after taking a no-nonsense
stance toward banks for hoarding massive piles of non-performing
loans, other sources said earlier.
    But Enria is also seen as a strong candidate for being tough
on bad loans, a major problem for banks in his native Italy, as
well as for banks in Greece, Portugal and Cyprus, two other
sources said this week.
    The current head of the SSM, France's Daniele Nouy, is due
to step down when her term expires at the end of the year.
    An ECB spokesman declined to comment.
    The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs
Committee and the European Council must also approve the ECB's
choice of new SSM chief.

deposits rose in September for an eighth consecutive month,
increasing by 139 million euros  ($159.34 million), central bank
data showed on Wednesday.
    Businesses and household deposits rose to 131.71 billion

    Greek banks have seen deposit inflows over the space of more

    Athens exited its latest bailout in August and will rely on
bond markets to refinance its debt.
    While the country's banks still turn to central bank
borrowing to plug their funding gaps, they have significantly
reduced their exposure.
    ""In September, deposits placed by the private sector

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and the euro zone's
government bond yields dropped on Wednesday after data showed
business growth in the single currency area lost more momentum
than expected, as trade tensions and worries over Italy
overshadow the economy. 
    Euro zone business growth decelerated faster than expected
as the final quarter of 2018 began, dragged down by waning
orders that dented confidence, according to a purchasing
managers survey released on Wednesday. [nL9N1T2014]    
    ""The flash PMI for October gives a first glimpse on where
the euro zone economy is heading. And the picture is not
terrific,"" ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said in a note. 
    The data for the euro zone came after French and German
business surveys released earlier also undershot expectations.
[nL9N1T2012] [nL9N1T2013]
    The euro extended its losses after the PMIs, falling half a
percent to $1.1408 <EUR=>, its lowest since Aug. 20. It was
already down about 0.4 percent after the German and French
surveys. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield pulled back from the day's low
of 0.39 percent <DE10YT=RR> and was last seen at 0.4 percent.
Other high-grade euro zone bond yields also fell. France's
10-year yield hit a five-week low of 0.77 percent. <FR10YT=RR>  
  
    ""It's true that the wider euro zone figures were below
expectations, and the fact that the services sector is falling
as well is a bit troublesome,"" said Natixis strategist Cyril
Regnat. 
    ""We keep having downside risks on growth ... I do feel the
ECB will say the trade war issue and global downside risks are
gently weighing on confidence, but their statement about growth
should probably remain unchanged,"" Regnat said.   
    The European Central Bank is due to meet on Thursday, when
its president, Mario Draghi, may hint at how concern over
Italy's budget and equity market downturns will affect monetary
policy.
    ""Besides risk sentiment, economic sentiment should be key
today as both can influence the tone at tomorrow's ECB meeting,""
Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients.
    
DIFFICULT PERIOD 
Italian government bonds edged off the previous day's highs as a
recovery in European stocks improved risk sentiment, though
analysts warned the country has a difficult period coming up.
    Italian yields fell as much as three basis points across the
curve, down from the weekly highs they reached on Tuesday after
the European Union rejected Italy's draft budget for 2019.
[nR1N1W500C] <IT2YT=RR>, <IT10YT=RR>
    Analysts attribute the recovery to improved risk sentiment
after a late rally in Wall Street and a corresponding boost for
European shares Wednesday. 
    ""The slight improvement in risk sentiment in equity markets
could be feeding through, but it's going to be a tough week for
the (Italy/Germany) spread,"" said ING strategist Martin Van
Vliet. ""Many investors are going to remain on the sidelines
until the S&P decision.""
    S&P Global is due on Friday to review Italy's credit rating,
currently at BBB with a stable outlook.
    Analysts expect a downgrade, but are divided on whether this
will only be lowering the outlook to ""negative"", or whether
Italy's credit rating will be cut to BBB-, the lowest
investment-grade rating.

    NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar surged nearly 1
percent against the euro on Wednesday to its strongest since
Aug. 20 after European data signaled that economic growth could
be flagging across the euro zone.
    Euro zone business growth slowed more than expected this
month, a widely watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey
showed. German private-sector growth fell to its lowest in more
than three years, and manufacturing in France hit a 25-month
low, according to other surveys. [nL9N1T2014][nL9N1T2013]
[nL9N1T2012] 
    The market is also concerned about an escalating U.S.-China
trade war, a heated debt dispute in Italy and the prospect of
tightening financial conditions. Against the dollar, the euro
fell as much as 0.79 percent, breaking below the $1.14 level and
heading toward its biggest daily loss since late September
<EUR=>.
    The European reports ""came in weaker than expected and
suggest that some of the softness we saw in Q2 and Q3 may not be
as temporary as people were assuming,"" said Daniel Katzive, head
of foreign exchange strategy for North American at BNP Paribas. 
     ""Even though the U.S. is starting to show some cracks and
vulnerability to global trade and geopolitical stresses, Europe
is still more vulnerable from an economic perspective."" 
    Weakness in the single currency supported the dollar index,
which rose 0.4 percent against a basket of six rival currencies
to 96.296 <.DXY>.
    The euro also fell 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.137 francs <EURCHF=>, a two-week low.
    The European Central Bank holds its monetary policy meeting
on Thursday, and investors will be looking for any comments
about the deepening row between the European Union and Italy
over Rome's budget.
    The Canadian dollar fell by 0.76 percent on Wednesday
morning after the country's central bank raised interest rates
as expected and said more hikes would be needed to keep
inflation in check <CAD=>.
    The Bank of Canada - which has now lifted rates five times
since July 2017 as the economy strengthens - tweaked its
standard language on future hikes, dropping previous references
to the gradual pace of tightening. [nBCLOLEE2T]
    The Japanese yen, often bought when broader markets slide, 
gave up its earlier gains, suggesting some renewed demand for
risk-taking as stock markets rebounded on Wednesday. The yen
<JPY=> weakened to 112.51 yen per dollar, but remains almost two
percent stronger since Oct. 4. 
    Sterling fell 0.39 percent to $1.293 <GBP=> amid

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and the euro zone's
government bond yields dropped on Wednesday after data showed
business growth in the single currency area lost more momentum
than expected, as trade tensions and worries over Italy
overshadow the economy.
    The bid for quality assets gathered pace after the U.S.
market open, with most of the single currency area's bond yields
falling further as equity markets were pushed lower by bearish
sentiment over trade conflicts, concerns about Italy's budget
and criticism of Saudi Arabia over the killing of a journalist.
[nL2N1X413L]
    Euro zone business growth decelerated faster than expected
as the final quarter of 2018 began, dragged down by waning

    DIFFICULT PERIOD
    Italian government bond yields rose as much as seven basis
points in late trade on Wednesday as a recovery in European
stocks proved short lived, and Italian banking stocks fell.
[nS8N1RT01S] 
    Italy's sovereign yields rose across the curve, extending
the weekly highs they reached on Tuesday after the European
Union rejected the country's draft budget for 2019. [nR1N1W500C]
    Its five-year government bond yields were seven bps higher
on the day to 2.97 percent, while its 10-year bond yields rose
four bps to 3.62 percent <IT2YT=RR>, <IT10YT=RR>. 
    One analyst said selling in Italian bonds was led by the
Italian equity market, which was down around 1.69 percent
<.FTMIB>. Others said comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Luigi Di Maio on the so-called ""golden power"" rules did not
help. [nS8N1RT01S]
    The rules allow the government to veto strategic decisions
such as asset sales and mergers at businesses deemed to be of
strategic national importance.
    ""The government is doing things that aren't that business
friendly,"" said Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank.
    Investors are also cautious on Italian bonds ahead of a
ratings review by S&P Global on Friday. S&P is due to review
Italy's credit rating, currently at BBB with a stable outlook.
    Analysts expect a downgrade, but are divided on whether this
will only be lowering the outlook to ""negative"", or whether
Italy's credit rating will be cut to BBB-, the lowest
investment-grade rating.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

    * Think-tank plan goes much further than EU planned reform
    * Some EU states are weak links, don't publish fines -report

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Union should set
up a new agency to counter money laundering after a series of
high-profile cases at banks bared weaknesses in the system, an
influential think-tank said in a report, urging full disclosure
of fines imposed on wrongdoers.
    Over the last months, lenders in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia,
Luxembourg, Malta, Spain, the Netherlands, Britain and Cyprus
have been embroiled in money laundering scandals, with criminal
schemes often executed through foreign branches within the EU.
    Increased media attention to recent cases has pushed EU
regulators to discuss limited changes to the bloc's legal
framework, but proposals to slightly increase the monitoring
powers of the European Banking Authority (EBA) face opposition
in some member states [nL8N1W74DQ].
    However, the reform should go much further than what is
currently discussed, experts at the Brussels-based think-tank
Bruegel said in a report on Thursday.
    ""It is evident that recent anti-money laundering supervision
in the EU has been embarrassingly ineffective, and that deep
reform thus needs to be considered,"" Joshua Kirschenbaum and
Nicolas Veron wrote in the Bruegel paper titled: ""A better
European Union architecture to fight money laundering.""
    European Union diplomats have been briefed on the content of
the paper in recent meetings as they prepare an action plan on
money laundering by the end of the year.
    The Bruegel document urges the creation of a new European
anti-money laundering authority with several hundred staff.
    The plan is far more ambitious than legislative proposals
put forward by the European Commission in September which would
raise to 12 the total number of EU staff dealing with money
laundering at the bloc's banks, and would leave most powers in
the hands of member states. 
    
    WEAK LINKS
    But the authors of the report say the establishment of a new
authority would be easier and more effective than extending the
powers of existing agencies, and would replicate the successful
common supervision of financial risks at euro zone banks
conducted by the European Central Bank. 
    The ECB has repeatedly endorsed the idea of a single money
laundering body.
    An EU-wide agency would break the ""weak links"" in some EU
countries ""where money launderers tend to concentrate their
activity"", in some cases even with the complicity of
governments, the report said, without naming specific states.
    The establishment of the new body would take time, likely up
to 2022, ""but the decision to set it up need not be postponed,""
the report said. 
    The new agency would also favour an improvement of EU rules
against money laundering, which are currently insufficient and
applied inconsistently in EU states, the authors said.
    Exploiting loopholes in EU rules, states can currently
decide on their own the size and publication of fines for banks
involved in money laundering. 
    Denmark, Spain and Germany do not expose sanctioned banks,
while other states like Luxembourg decide case-by-case, despite
international guidelines that recommend publication of all
sanctions as a key step toward deterring financial crime.
[nL8N1WV4HJ]
    This situation would change with a new authority that
publishes all its sanction decisions and imposes sufficiently
large fines to discourage malfeasance, the report concluded.

    * Might formalise December exit from asset purchase scheme
    * This would send signal to Rome in budget row with Brussels

    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
seems certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but likely to
acknowledge the growth outlook is deteriorating, even if not yet
enough to derail a carefully crafted retreat from stimulus. 
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with four years of
unprecedented support, the ECB will reaffirm its asset purchases
are set to end this year but also note that uncertainty is on
the rise in the euro zone, giving its policy outlook a dovish
undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively benign with policymakers looking
for only small and infrequent moves from late next year as the
bloc's economic expansion slows back to what is considered its
natural potential after an exceptional run last year.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, the escalating political fight between
Rome and Brussels will also be on the central bank's agenda.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi, himself an Italian, may repeat that
no individual member state can expect its help, particularly one
whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union rules. 
    ""The ECB seems determined to end its net asset purchases –
almost no matter what,"" Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. 
    ""If anything, expect a re-assessment of risks: The ECB could
downgrade the risks to the outlook from broadly balanced to
tilted to the downside.""   
    But investors might take a change of risk assessment as a
sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is not prepared for
that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, the ECB could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private say that the bar
on extending the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme is
very high and it was too early to reassess the interest rate
guidance, which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer.
    They are also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
    The ECB announces its policy decision at 1145 GMT, followed
by Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by
Reuters are unanimous in expecting rates to stay unchanged and
for the bond buys to end in December. [nL3N1WV48S]
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-offs could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    To send that signal more explicitly to Rome, the ECB could
formalise its decision to end bond purchases as soon as Thursday
rather than, as generally expected, defer it until December.
    ""The ECB would likely be reluctant to help a government that
is in open and deliberate breach of the rules,"" BNP Paribas said
in a note to clients. ""Just as importantly, it would not want to
be seen to be doing so.""
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new
emission standards could also dent third quarter growth with
reverberating effects for the wider economy. 
    Beyond the broader economic outlook, the ECB may also debate
tweaks to policy on reinvesting cash from maturing debt, as
flagged by Draghi last month.
    While that decision is also not expected until December, the
ECB could already decide on Thursday to emphasize that it will
remain in the bond market for years to come with enough
firepower to smooth periods of stress.
    Yet changes in reinvestments are expected to be mostly
technical to ensure smooth implementation of ECB policies as
bonds often mature in large chunks.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    The European Commission had no comment.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

 (Adds markets, quote)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
seems certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but it is
likely to acknowledge the growth outlook is deteriorating, even
if not yet by enough to derail a carefully crafted retreat from
stimulus. 
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with four years of
unprecedented support, the ECB will reaffirm its asset purchases
are set to end this year but also note that uncertainty is on
the rise in the euro zone, giving its policy outlook a dovish
undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively limited with policymakers making
only small and infrequent moves from late next year as the
bloc's economic expansion slows to what is considered its
natural potential rate after an exceptional run last year.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, the escalating political fight between
Rome and Brussels will also be on the central bank's agenda.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi, himself an Italian, may repeat that
no individual member state can expect its help, particularly one
whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union rules. 
    ""The ECB seems determined to end its net asset purchases –
almost no matter what,"" Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. 
    ""If anything, expect a re-assessment of risks: The ECB could
downgrade the risks to the outlook from broadly balanced to
tilted to the downside.""   
    But investors might take a change of risk assessment as a
sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is not prepared for
that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, the ECB could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private say that the bar
for extending the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme
is very high and it was too early to reassess interest rate
guidance, which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer.
    They are also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
    The ECB announces its policy decision at 1145 GMT, followed
by Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by
Reuters are unanimous in expecting rates to stay unchanged and
for the bond buys to end in December. [nL3N1WV48S]
    Italian government bond yields hovered just below 4-1/2
years high at 0639 GMT.
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-offs could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    To send that signal more explicitly to Rome, the ECB could
formalise its decision to end bond purchases as soon as Thursday
rather than, as generally expected, defer it until December.
    ""The ECB would likely be reluctant to help a government that
is in open and deliberate breach of the rules,"" BNP Paribas said
in a note to clients. ""Just as importantly, it would not want to
be seen to be doing so.""
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new
emission standards could also dent third quarter growth with
reverberating effects for the wider economy. 
    Beyond the broader economic outlook, the ECB may also debate
tweaks to policy on reinvesting cash from maturing debt,
particularly government debt bought as part of its Public Sector
Purchase Programme (PSPP).
    While that decision is also not expected until December, the
ECB could decide on Thursday to emphasize that it will remain in
the bond market for years to come with enough firepower to
smooth periods of stress.
    Yet changes in reinvestments are expected to be mostly
technical to ensure smooth implementation of ECB policies as
bonds often mature in large chunks.
    ""We expect the ECB will signal it aims to minimise the
roll-down of its PSPP portfolio... by targeting long-dated bond
in its reinvestments,"" analysts at brokerage Mizuho wrote in a
note to clients.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Despite trade concerns, evidence
of a weakening euro zone outlook and looming risks like a
no-deal Brexit and an Italian debt crisis, the European Central
Bank looks determined for now to stick to its guns on winding
down stimulus. There seems little doubt that it will keep its
policy on hold at today's rate-setting meeting - the main
questions are about how explicitly it chooses to acknowledge
that the growth outlook is deteriorating. It could, for example,
downgrade the risks to the outlook from broadly balanced to
tilted to the downside. The danger in that, however, would be
that investors might take a change of risk assessment as a sign
of an imminent policy move. The ECB announces its policy
decision at 1145 GMT, followed by Mario Draghi's news conference
at 1230 GMT. 
    NATO allies are due to meet today to hear Washington explain
the thinking behind President Donald Trump's move to quit the
1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which rid Europe
of land-based nuclear missiles. It will be interesting to see
whether the United States's European allies overtly tell
Washington they will not host U.S. missiles on their soil -
something Vladimir Putin has warned would lead to them becoming
targets for Russian missiles. 
    Once more the plotters against British PM Theresa May's
leadership of the Conservative Party failed to come out into the
open at a meeting with her last night, the conclusion of which
was an albeit stage-managed show of loyalty. No one is under any
illusions that the party is happy with her leadership, but the
simple fact is that it has no one out there seen more competent.
The same is true with the country, it seems: An Ipsos MORI poll
on Wednesday showed a record 78 percent of voters lacked
confidence in May to get a good deal from Brussels, ""and nor is
there much evidence that they would have much more confidence in
anyone else"" notes the pollster's head of political research.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    As the global stock markets slide snowballs into one of the
worst months of the past 10 years, attention will now start to
shift back to see whether policymakers can offset the mounting
investor gloom that threatens to feed back into the real
economy, business spending and consumption. The ECB meeting
provides one opportunity to signal any rethink of gradual
monetary policy tightening worldwide, with soured euro business
confidence readings at their lowest in four years this month as
Sino-U.S. trade war fears bite German exporters in particular.
While the ECB is unlikely to alter its late 2019 timeline for
possible interest rate rises, it may sound concerns about the
deterioration in financial market and business sentiment that
could prompt speculation about the pace how it winds down its
bond-buying stimulus programme. The lack of policy ammunition to
guard against another economic downturn, however, is a factor
that unnerves investors in equal measure. While fellow G7 member
the Bank of Canada ploughed ahead with a rate rise on Wednesday
- and signalling more to come - the acceleration of the equity
market selloff on Wall St and worldwide overnight will start to
register more loudly. S&P500 losses of more than 3 percent now
make October so far the worst year for the index in 9 years.
Concerns about deteriorating forward guidance from U.S.
companies hit by President Trump’s trade wars has added to
monetary tightening fears and spreading bear market signals
around the globe. Heavy losses for the technology sector after
warnings from chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and STMicro
saw the Nasdaq lose more than 4 percent and enter formal
correction territory of more than 10 percent losses from this
year’s peaks. The VIX volatility gauge spiked to more than 25
percent. Microsoft regained some of its 5 percent losses after
the bell, however, after decent Q3 results. 
    The broad market selling continued through Asia markets,
with Tokyo’s Nikkei losing almost 4 percent and HK and Seoul
down more than 1 percent. MSCI’s all-country index has now lost
more than 9 percent so far in October to its lowest levels in
over a year and is on course for its worst month since the
height of euro crisis in 2012. MSCI’s emerging markets equity
benchmark, now down almost 27 percent from the peaks of January,
fell to its lowest level since March of 2017. Against a backdrop
of the dire October business sentiment readings and a drop in
the euro zone economic surprise index to its most negative since
May, European stock futures were down more than half a  percent
too. The dollar and U.S. Treasury bonds were all higher amid the
equity market trepidation. Euro/dollar dipped below $1.14
overnight for the first time since mid-August before rebounding
slightly this morning. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered
about 3.10 percent. Emerging market currencies were weaker
across the board. Sterling steady after Wednesday’s losses after
UK PM May appeared to get a positive reception after meeting
with Conservative party lawmakers and following reports she may
face a leadership challenge. Brent crude oil prices steadied
about $75. Turkey’s lira slipped slightly ahead of Turkey’s
central bank policy decision later. 
    A slew of European earnings to keep traders busy with UBS,
AB InBev, and Norwegian Air among those reporting. Results were
looking slightly better for banks, with both Switzerland’s
biggest bank UBS and Britain’s biggest mortgage lender Lloyds
beating profit expectations. Stronger than expected results from
Swiss engineering firm ABB could also encourage investors after
weak earnings from Caterpillar drove a sharp selloff and anxiety
around industrials. On the other hand, with tech particularly in
the spotlight after the Nasdaq had its worst fall since Aug
2011, BE Semiconductor’s results will do nothing to lessen
concerns. The Amsterdam-listed maker of semiconductor assembly
equipment said it saw a nearly 25 percent drop in Q4 revenue due
to weaker market conditions. AB InBev could also sink after
cutting its dividend and reporting in-line Q3 earnings.

materialising,"" Wohlrabe said, adding that pessimism was
spreading in the auto industry where business expectations fell
significantly, burdened by the WLTP emissions tests.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Europe attempted a rebound on
Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day since 2011 and heavy
losses in Asia put global stocks firmly on course for their
worst month since the financial crisis.
    It wasn't a sunny picture by any means. Germany's Dax
<.GDAX> hit a near two-year low and London's FTSE <.FTSE> and
Paris' CAC 40 <.FCHI> both brushed 1-1/2 year lows early on, but
a semblance of stability was emerging. [.EU]
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was almost back at level
pegging having opened down almost 1 percent and after Japan's
Nikkei <.N225> had slumped 3.5 percent overnight. [.T]
    Currency dealers were also cautiously reversing out of Swiss
franc <CHF=> and Japanese yen <JPY=> safety trades [/FRX] and
Italian and Spanish bonds made ground as traders waited to see
what message the European Central Bank delivers at its meeting
later. [GVD/EUR]
    ""The markets have been acting like classic flight-to-safety
markets,"" said London & Capital's head of fixed income Sanjay
Joshi, pointing to the slump in stocks and rally in safer bonds
and currencies.
    ""The worst thing the ECB could do would be to come out with
a hawkish statement considering the situation we have at the
moment."" 
    Most economists expect ECB President Mario Draghi to say the
bank will stick to plans to end stimulus this year. But it will
be the signal he sends about market volatility and concerns
around Italy, his homeland, that could be most crucial.    
    Heavyweight investors have become increasingly nervous about
lofty stock prices, faster rate hikes in the United States and
an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world
growth.
    Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI's global

territory -- down 20 percent or more from their most recent

Nikkei <.N225> tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low.

[nL3N1X51LA][nH9N1WZ024]
    ""If you're a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget
there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms
of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,"" said Jim McCafferty, head
of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.
   
    TALKING TURKEY
    Europe's stabilisation was aided by results from Swiss bank
UBS and engineering giant ABB <ABBN.S> which helped take the
edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning
from U.S. digger behemoth Caterpillar <CAT.N>. [nL3N1X44CY]
    The ECB was looming too. Weak euro zone economic data this
week have added to angst over world growth, as has a surprise
slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates
were sapping demand for housing. [nL2N1X31LR]
    It wasn't just the ECB that was being closely watched
either. Turkey, which has been stabilising in recent weeks
having been at the centre of emerging market troubles was also
holding a central bank meeting.
    The consensus is that having almost doubled its interest
rates already this year to 24 percent, it might be brave enough
to hold still this month. [nL8N1WY2EY]   
    In foreign exchange markets, the euro clawed its way back up

$1.1430. 
    Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a
nine-week peak to 96.296 <.DXY> and for the first time in days
it was barely budged against the safety first Japanese yen at

began to gain having been dragged down by the concerns over

  At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.
  The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
  Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of €15 billion until the end of December 2018.
  The Governing Council anticipates that, subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases will then end.
  The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
  The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course
to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates
sometime after next summer.
    With inflation rebounding and growth on a five-year run, the
ECB has been removing stimulus for much of this year, even if
more recent growth indicators appear to show that the expansion
is running out of steam and risks to the outlook are mounting. 
    But with the bank having already exhausted much of its
firepower the threshold for any extension of its stimulus is
high, requiring a major shock rather than the gradual slowdown
that has characterized this year.
    The bank also made no change to its policy guidance, first
formulated in June and kept broadly unchanged through several

    Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT
news conference, at which he is likely to discuss the broader
economic outlook and will be questioned about Italy's budget
fight with the European Commission.
    Investors will also look to see if Draghi maintains the
ECB's long-standing stance that growth risks are broadly
balanced or takes a more dovish view given a string of
disappointing data. 
    With Thursday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight
deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool,
remains at -0.40 percent.
    The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of
credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00 percent while
the rate on the marginal lending facility -- the emergency
overnight borrowing rate for banks -- remains at 0.25 percent.

 (Updates with rate decision)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($684.30
billion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and rates
could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi is nevertheless expected to
acknowledge in his 1230 GMT news conference that the growth
outlook has worsened as both domestic and external factors weigh
on confidence, which would give the bank's policy outlook a
dovish undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively benign with policymakers in the
past arguing for only small and infrequent moves from late next
year as growth slows to what is considered its natural potential
rate after an exceptional run last year.
    ""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to
remain at their present levels at least through the summer of
2019,"" the ECB said in a statement. 
    Investors will look to see if Draghi maintains the ECB's
long-standing assessment that risks to growth are broadly
balanced or whether he acknowledges the worsened outlook by
highlighting downside risks. 
    The problem is that investors might take a change of risk
assessment as a sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is
not prepared for that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, Draghi could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high
and that it is too early to reassess interest rate guidance,
which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer. 
    Draghi is also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi is also expected to be quizzed
about the cost of the escalating political fight between Rome
and Brussels.
    Draghi, himself an Italian, is expected to repeat that no
individual member state can expect the ECB's help, particularly
one whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union
rules. 
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-off could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new

    * Remains on track to end QE by year end
    * Investors looking to see whether risk assessment
downgraded
    * ECB likely to acknowledge growth outlook has worsened
    * Italy's conflict with EU may dominate press conference

    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and rates
could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi is nevertheless expected to
acknowledge in his 1230 GMT news conference that the growth
outlook has worsened as both domestic and external factors weigh
on confidence, which would give the bank's policy outlook a
dovish undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively benign with policymakers in the
past arguing for only small and infrequent moves from late next
year as growth slows to what is considered its natural potential
rate after an exceptional run last year.
    ""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to
remain at their present levels at least through the summer of
2019,"" the ECB said in a statement. 
    Investors will look to see if Draghi maintains the ECB's
long-standing assessment that risks to growth are broadly
balanced or whether he acknowledges the worsened outlook by
highlighting downside risks. 
    The problem is that investors might take a change of risk
assessment as a sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is
not prepared for that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, Draghi could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high
and that it is too early to reassess interest rate guidance,
which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer. 
    Draghi is also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi is also expected to be quizzed
about the cost of the escalating political fight between Rome
and Brussels.
    Draghi, himself an Italian, is expected to repeat that no
individual member state can expect the ECB's help, particularly
one whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union
rules. 
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-off could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new
emissions standards could also dent third-quarter growth with
reverberating effects for the wider economy. 
    Beyond the broader economic outlook, Draghi may also discuss
tweaks to the ECB's policy on reinvesting cash from maturing
debt, particularly government debt bought as part of its Public
Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP).
    While that decision is also not expected until December, the
ECB could decide on Thursday to emphasize that it will remain in
the bond market for years to come, with enough firepower to
smooth periods of stress.
    Changes in reinvestments are expected to be mostly
technical, to ensure smooth implementation of ECB policies as
bonds often mature in large chunks.

    By Natalia Zinets
    KIEV, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 18 percent on Thursday
after two consecutive hikes, but warned of possible tightening
further down the line if inflation pressures don't ease.
    Kiev last week secured a $3.9 billion stand-by credit line
from the International Monetary Fund to help maintain stability
and investor confidence going into elections next year. 
    But the central bank on Thursday upwardly revised its 2018
and 2019 inflation forecasts to 10.1 percent from 8.9 percent
and 6.3 percent from 5.8 percent, respectively.
    It said inflation expectations have worsened and getting
price moves down to its target level would take more time,
citing rising oil prices, wage growth and external conditions as
the main risks.
    ""If inflation pressures do not ease or build up, the central
bank could raise the key policy rate again,"" a statement said. 
    IMF aid to Ukraine had effectively been frozen since April
2017 as Kiev struggled to keep pace with the IMF's demands for
reforms and measures to tackle corruption.
    The new deal has allowed the government, which must service
a rising debt burden next year, to issue new debt and would also
pave the way for the European Union and other foreign donors to
disburse more aid.  
    But to qualify for more aid, Ukraine must pass a budget in
line with the IMF's expectations and follow through on a
decision to raise gas prices. 
    Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy told reporters he
expected the IMF board, which must give its final approval for
aid disbursal, would meet in December, meaning Ukraine may
receive a tranche this year.
    He also said Ukraine may raise household gas tariffs again
in 2019, which is in line with the IMF's wishes but may trigger
a voter backlash as the country goes to the polls in first
presidential and then parliamentary elections. 
    The bank gave higher than previously projected estimates for
Ukraine's current account deficit in 2018 and 2019. But it kept
its forecast for economic growth unchanged at 3.4 percent in
2018 and 2.5 percent in 2019.
    It said its projections were contingent on Ukraine securing
the IMF aid and could also be derailed by worsening inflation
expectations and external conditions.

maintained on Thursday its long-standing view that risks to the
economy are broadly balanced, playing down a long list of signs
that growth may have failed to stabilise and continues to slow. 
    ""The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can
still be assessed as broadly balanced,"" ECB President Mario
Draghi told a news conference. ""At the same time, risks related
to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and
financial market volatility remain prominent.""
    With a global trade war looming, the risk of a hard Brexit
increasing and industrial production taking a hit over the
summer quarter, the euro zone economy has underperformed
expectations, raising the risk that the ECB will struggle to
wean the bloc off stimulus.
   The ECB had debated last month whether to downgrade its risk
assessment, suggesting that policymakers are increasingly
concerned that the slowdown is not due to one-off factors as
previously thought. 
    The problem with downgrading the assessment is that
investors could then anticipate a policy response that the ECB
is not prepared for, especially since inflation, the ECB's
mandate, remains on the path seen earlier.
    With much of the bank's firepower exhausted, policymakers
argue that the bar on extending bond purchases is high and any
discussion about interest rates is premature since the ECB has
guided markets for no change ""through"" next summer, an unusually
long horizon for a policy guidance.

inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
    Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will
continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of 15 billion euros
until the end of December 2018. We anticipate that, subject to
incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we
will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an
extended period of time after the end of our net asset
purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain
favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary
accommodation.
    Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected,
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion
of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation
pressures. The underlying strength of the economy continues to
support our confidence that the sustained convergence of
inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even
after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the
same time, uncertainties relating to protectionism,
vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market
volatility remain prominent. Significant monetary policy
stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of
domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments
over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided
by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the
sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated
reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key
ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands
ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure
that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s
inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail,
starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP
increased by 0.4 percent, quarter on quarter, in both the first
and the second quarter of 2018. Incoming information, while
somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with
our baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic
expansion, supported by domestic demand and continued
improvements in the labour market. Some recent sector-specific
developments are having an impact on the near-term growth
profile. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpin
domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing
employment growth and rising wages. At the same time, business
investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable
financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing
investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global
activity is expected to continue supporting euro area exports,
though at a slower pace.
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets
and financial market volatility remain prominent.
    Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1 percent in
September 2018, from 2.0 percent in August, reflecting mainly
higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current
futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are
likely to hover around the current level over the coming months.
While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted,
they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost
pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking
ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the
end of the year and to increase further over the medium term,
supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic
expansion and rising wage growth.
    Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth
stood at 3.5 percent in September 2018, after 3.4 percent in
August. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth
is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow
monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad
money growth.
    The growth of loans to the private sector strengthened
further, continuing the upward trend observed since the
beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to
non-financial corporations rose to 4.3 percent in September
2018, from 4.1 percent in August, while the annual growth rate
of loans to households stood at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the
previous month. The euro area bank lending survey for the third
quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be
supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and
favorable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and
loans for house purchase.
    The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in
place since June 2014 continues to significantly support
borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to
financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises
– and credit flows across the euro area.
    To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic
analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis
confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is
still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
    In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy
measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to
raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing
vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in
euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to
increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost
euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal
policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal
buffers. This is particularly important in countries where
government debt is high and for which full adherence to the
Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound
fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent
implementation of the EU’s fiscal and economic governance
framework over time and across countries remains essential to
bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the
functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.
The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to
complete the banking union and the capital markets union.

its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course
to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates
sometime after next summer.
    Following are highlights of ECB President Mario Draghi's
comments at a post-policy meeting press conference.
    
    FUTURE POLICY TOOLS
    We haven't discussed what we are going to do next... We
didn't discuss anything at this meeting, so we are going to
discuss it in the next meeting, where we will also have the
projections, which will also cast some light on what's going to
happen next.
    We do think that we still have tools in our toolbox that we
can use different contingencies. We have not discussed any one
of them today. The TLTRO was raised by two speakers only, but
not in any detail. But this is just an example of how the
toolbox is still quite rich in terms of monetary policy
instruments.
        
    STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT
    The (European) Commission is the ultimate guardian of the
Stability and Growth Pact, not the ECB.
    
    ITALY BONDS
    I don't have a crystal ball... These bonds are in the banks'
portfolios. They are denting in to the capital position of the
banks - that is obvious, that's what it is.  
    I'm still confident an agreement will be found. You have
dent in capital expenditure and then you have weakening funding
conditions as well and all this is going to translate into
different lending terms. 
    
    ITALY BUDGET
    On Italy, you have to remember that Italy is a fiscal
discussion, so there wasn't much discussion about Italy... Vice
President Dombrovskis was there, and I asked him permission to
quote him to what he said. He said of course, 'we have to
observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking a
dialogue.' 

    (My personal perception is) I'm confident that an agreement
will be found.
        
    UNDERLYING INFLATION
    While measures of underlying inflation remain generally
muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
    Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up
towards the end of the year and to increase further over the
medium term.
    
    GROWTH RISKS STILL BROADLY BALANCED
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets,
and financial market volatility remain prominent.

    NEAR-TERM GROWTH IMPACT
    Some recent sector-specific developments are having an
impact on the near-term growth profile. 

    READY TO ADJUST ALL INSTRUMENTS 
    The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its
instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to
move towards the... inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    
    PROTECTIONISM, VOLATILITY
    Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in
emerging markets, and financial market volatility remain
prominent. 
    
    SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS
    Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to
support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and
headline inflation developments over the medium term.
    
    UNDERLYING STRENGTH
    ""The underlying strength of the economy continues to support
our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to
our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual
winding down of our net asset purchases.""

    SOMEWHAT WEAKER THAN EXPECTED
    ""Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected,
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion
of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation
pressures.""

    ITALIAN BANKS
    What can one do as far as banks are concerned given the
widening of the spreads that has taken place in the last five or
six months?
    The first answer to come to mind is reduce the tone and
don't question the constitutional existential framework of the
euro. 
    The second is reduce the spreads so do policies that lead to
a reduction in the spreads.

use a different concept other than the capital key.""

Fund (IMF) chief Rodrigo Rato arrived at a Madrid prison on
Thursday to start a four-and-a-half year jail term for using
company credit cards to make costly personal purchases while
running state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>.
    Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent
figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the
IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state
bailout in 2012.
    Spain's High Court ruled in 2017 that Rato was responsible
for overseeing the misuse of credit cards at the bank, which
involved 64 former Bankia executives, including Rato.
    Corporate credit cards were used to buy jewels, holidays and
expensive clothes, as well as more mundane everyday personal
purchases. In total, prosecutors investigated some 12 million
euros in spending between 2003 and 2012.
    Carrying two suitcases and dressed in jeans, a grey shirt
and a blue sleeveless jacket, Rato thanked family and friends
for their support during the legal process against him before
entering the Soto del Real prison on the outskirts of Madrid.
     ""First of all I would like to say that I fully accept my
obligations before society, I recognise all the mistakes that I 
may have made and I ask for forgiveness from those who may have
felt deceived,"" Rato told reporters gathered outside the jail.
    He appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing, arguing
the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were legal.
    But Spain's Supreme Court confirmed earlier this month the
four-and-half year jail sentence from the High Court and said it
considered the sentence to be proportionate due to Rato's
preeminent position at Bankia.
    The so-called ""black cards"" case sparked widespread anger
when the scandal first broke in 2014, at a time when Spain was
recovering from years of recession, mass layoffs and a banking
crisis partly triggered by Bankia's massive bailout.
    Rato still faces two other legal cases, one over Bankia's
ill-fated public listing in 2011 -- with the trial expected to
begin at the end of November -- and another for tax fraud.

    FRAGILE MONETARY UNION
    Our monetary union remains fragile if it is not completed.
And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean the
capital market union, I mean the fiscal capacity design of a
fiscal capacity.
    And all these things are intertwined. Because the better it
is the capital market union, probably the less need we have for
a big fiscal capacity. To make progress on this... I would say
by and large, (we need) the right political contingency. It is
not something that central bankers or Eurocrats can push forward
by themselves. 

    FORWARD GUIDANCE
    (Forward guidance) has served us very well. It has kept
anchored the short-term part of the yield curve while the QE was
actually addressing the long-term part of the yield curve.

 (Releads with Draghi quotes from news conference, euro moves)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    Acknowledging a weaker recent momentum in the euro zone
economy, ECB chief Mario Draghi reeled off what he called a
""bunch of uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism,
emerging markets and financial market volatility.
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he told an ECB news conference to
justify its policymakers' decision to maintain their judgment
that risks remained ""broadly balanced"".
    The euro ticked higher to $1.1433 as he spoke, additionally
helped by his comment that recent wage increases in the region
-- a key factor in bringing inflation back to levels seen as
normal -- did not look like a one-off phenomenon.
    ""The underlying strength of the economy continues to support
our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to
our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual
winding down of our net asset purchases,"" he said.    
    Earlier the Governing Council statement reaffirmed its
expectation that key ECB interest rates would remain at their
present levels at least ""through the summer of 2019"". Draghi
completed the picture by adding there had been no discussion of
extending stimulus. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels over the
debt-laden country's expansionary budget.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.
    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added.

its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course
to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates
sometime after next summer.
    Following are highlights of ECB President Mario Draghi's
comments at a post-policy meeting press conference.
    
    FRAGILE MONETARY UNION
    Our monetary union remains fragile if it is not completed.
And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean the
capital market union, I mean the fiscal capacity design of a
fiscal capacity.
    And all these things are intertwined. Because the better it
is the capital market union, probably the less need we have for
a big fiscal capacity. To make progress on this... I would say
by and large, (we need) the right political contingency. It is
not something that central bankers or Eurocrats can push forward
by themselves. 
    These are big changes. These are big changes very often in
the way powers are being distributed between national
parliaments and national executives and European authorities or
even with other authority European rules. So we have to be
patient because we are not driving the political developments.
We are part of them.
    
    FORWARD GUIDANCE
    (Forward guidance) has served us very well. It has kept
anchored the short-term part of the yield curve while the QE was
actually addressing the long-term part of the yield curve. 
    
    ITALIAN BANKS
    What can one do as far as banks are concerned given the
widening of the spreads that has taken place in the last five or
six months?
    The first answer to come to mind is reduce the tone and
don't question the constitutional existential framework of the
euro. 
    The second is reduce the spreads so do policies that lead to
a reduction in the spreads.
    
    ON WHETHER REINVESTMENTS WILL BE BASED ON THE CAPITAL KEY  
    ""We haven't discussed (but) I'd be surprised if we were to
use a different concept other than the capital key.""  
    
    FUTURE POLICY TOOLS
    We haven't discussed what we are going to do next... We
didn't discuss anything at this meeting, so we are going to
discuss it in the next meeting, where we will also have the
projections, which will also cast some light on what's going to
happen next.
    We do think that we still have tools in our toolbox that we
can use different contingencies. We have not discussed any one
of them today. The TLTRO was raised by two speakers only, but
not in any detail. But this is just an example of how the
toolbox is still quite rich in terms of monetary policy
instruments.
        
    STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT
    The (European) Commission is the ultimate guardian of the
Stability and Growth Pact, not the ECB.
    
    ITALY BONDS
    I don't have a crystal ball... These bonds are in the banks'
portfolios. They are denting in to the capital position of the
banks - that is obvious, that's what it is.  
    I'm still confident an agreement will be found. You have
dent in capital expenditure and then you have weakening funding
conditions as well and all this is going to translate into
different lending terms. 
    
    ITALY BUDGET
    On Italy, you have to remember that Italy is a fiscal
discussion, so there wasn't much discussion about Italy... Vice
President Dombrovskis was there, and I asked him permission to
quote him to what he said. He said of course, 'we have to
observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking a
dialogue.' 

    (My personal perception is) I'm confident that an agreement
will be found.
        
    UNDERLYING INFLATION
    While measures of underlying inflation remain generally
muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
    Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up
towards the end of the year and to increase further over the
medium term.
    
    GROWTH RISKS STILL BROADLY BALANCED
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets,
and financial market volatility remain prominent.

    NEAR-TERM GROWTH IMPACT
    Some recent sector-specific developments are having an
impact on the near-term growth profile. 

    READY TO ADJUST ALL INSTRUMENTS 
    The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its
instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to
move towards the... inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    
    PROTECTIONISM, VOLATILITY
    Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in
emerging markets, and financial market volatility remain
prominent. 
    
    SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS
    Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to
support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and
headline inflation developments over the medium term.
    
    UNDERLYING STRENGTH
    ""The underlying strength of the economy continues to support
our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to
our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual
winding down of our net asset purchases.""

    SOMEWHAT WEAKER THAN EXPECTED
    ""Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected,
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion
of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation
pressures.""

    By Marc Jones
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - European and U.S. futures markets
attempted a rebound on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day
since 2011 and heavy losses in Asia gave global stocks another
boot towards their worst month since the financial crisis.
    Germany's DAX  <.GDAX> hit a near two-year low and London's
FTSE <.FTSE> and Paris's CAC 40 <.FCHI> both brushed 1 1/2-year
lows early on, but a semblance of stability was emerging. [.EU]
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was just about in
positive territory after a 3.7 percent overnight drubbing for
Tokyo's Nikkei and U.S. futures were up 0.7-1.3 percent as Wall
Street looked to snap a six-day run of falls. [.N] [.T]
    Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc <CHF=> and
Japanese yen <JPY=> safety trades [/FRX] and Italian and Spanish
bonds held their ground as Mario Draghi reiterated the European
Central Bank's plans to carefully remove its stimulus. [GVD/EUR]
    ""Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in
emerging markets and financial market volatility remain
prominent,"" Draghi said at the ECB's post-meeting news
conference.
    ""Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed,"" he
said. But there was also an important summary. ""Is this
(turbulence) enough to change our baseline scenario? No"", adding
too that he expected an agreement between Italy and Brussels on
Rome's disputed budget plans.
    Investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty stock
prices, faster interest rate hikes in the United States, Italy 
and an Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth.
    Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI's global
equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> are now in bear-market territory --
down 20 percent or more from their most recent peaks.
[nL8N1X36CB]
    There has also been growing concerns about overspending by
Italy's new populist coalition.  
    More woes in Asia overnight had seen the global wipeout on
the MSCI World since January near $7 trillion. Pan Asia-Pacific
shares <.MIAPJ0000PUS> skidded more than 2 percent while Japan's
Nikkei <.N225> tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low.
[nL3N1X51KR][.T]
    The one relief was that Chinese shares managed to close in
the black after dropping as much as 2.5 percent at one point.
<.SSEC> Fresh government support measures had failed to ease
worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the United
States. [nL3N1X51LA][nH9N1WZ024]
    ""If you're a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget,
there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms
of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,"" said Jim McCafferty, head
of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.
   
    TALKING TURKEY
    Europe's stabilisation was aided by results from Swiss bank
UBS and engineering giant ABB <ABBN.S> which helped take the
edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning
from the U.S. behemoth Caterpillar <CAT.N>. [nL3N1X44CY]
    Wall Street futures were also up between 1 percent for the
S&P 500 and Dow Jones and as much as 1.7 percent for the Nasdaq.
Wednesday's after-hours results from Microsoft and strong
advertising revenues from Twitter. <TWTR.N> brought some timely
cheer to tech stocks. [.N] 
    Google-parent Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> were
both up more than 2.2 percent ahead of their results later too,
while wider economy watchers were reassured as the number of
Americans receiving benefits fell to a more than a 45-year low.
    The ECB's ""steady as she goes"" message came after weak euro
zone economic data this week added to angst over world growth,
and a surprising slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested
rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing.
[nL2N1X31LR]
    It was not just the ECB in action either. Turkey, which has
stabilised in recent weeks after having been at the centre of
emerging market troubles, halted its recent rate hikes in a move
that, for once, did not unsettle markets.
    In fact the lira gained. The bank has almost doubled its
rates already this year to 24 percent after a 40 percent slump
in the Turkish currency <TRY=> pushed Ankara to the brink of a
full-blown currency crisis. [nL8N1WY2EY]   
    In the main foreign exchange markets, the euro recovered to
$1.1410 <EUR=>, having breached a long-standing bulwark of
$1.1430. 
    Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a
nine-week peak to 96.339 <.DXY>. For the first time in days it
was barely budged against the safety-first Japanese yen at
112.28 yen <JPY=>. [USD/]
    Sterling also inched off a seven-week trough to $1.2887
<GBP=>, having dropped 0.8 percent overnight, and oil prices
began to tick up again, having been dragged down in recent
sessions by the concerns over global growth.
    Brent crude <LCOc1> was last at $76.50 a barrel, while U.S.
crude was at $66.63 <CLc1> [O/R]. Safe-haven gold <XAU=> was a
tad weaker at $1,236.76 an ounce. 
    ""Expect spirited rallies,"" said Robin Bieber, technical
analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil.

    Following are highlights of ECB President Mario Draghi's
comments at a post-policy meeting press conference.
    
    FRAGILE MONETARY UNION
    Our monetary union remains fragile if it is not completed.
And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean the
capital market union, I mean the fiscal capacity design of a
fiscal capacity.
    And all these things are intertwined. Because the better it

a big fiscal capacity. To make progress on this... I would say
by and large, (we need) the right political contingency. It is
not something that central bankers or Eurocrats can push forward
by themselves. 
    These are big changes. These are big changes very often in
the way powers are being distributed between national
parliaments and national executives and European authorities or
even with other authority European rules. So we have to be
patient because we are not driving the political developments.
We are part of them.
    
    OPTIONS TO HELP ITALY OR OTHERS
    What is available for the ECB towards a specific country is
OMT. And the OMT is subject to having a program with ESM and is
also subject to the assessment by the Governing Council that the
undertaking of the OMT doesn't prejudge the monetary policy for
the whole of the euro area.
    But that is what is there. Our mandate, as I said before, is
a mandate towards price stability, not towards financing
governments' deficits or adhering to a fiscal dominance
situation.
    
    FORWARD GUIDANCE
    (Forward guidance) has served us very well. It has kept
anchored the short-term part of the yield curve while the QE was
actually addressing the long-term part of the yield curve.

 (Adds further quotes, euro move)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    Acknowledging a weaker recent momentum in the euro zone
economy, ECB chief Mario Draghi reeled off what he called a
""bunch of uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism,
emerging markets and financial market volatility.
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he told an ECB news conference to
justify its policymakers' decision to maintain their judgment
that risks remained ""broadly balanced"".
    He added: ""The underlying strength of the economy continues
to support our confidence that the sustained convergence of
inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even
after a gradual winding down of our net asset purchases.""
    Yet despite the hawkish message -- which included an upbeat
assessment of firmer wage pressures -- the euro fell on his
comment that Europe's monetary union remained ""fragile"" as long
as measures to shore up existing structures were not complete.
    ""And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean
the capital market union,"" he added of measures initiated as a
result of the sovereign debt crisis of almost a decade ago but
which have foundered on a lack of consensus among member states.
    The single currency slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.139
after having earlier reached a session-high of $1.143.
    Earlier, the Governing Council statement reaffirmed its view
that interest rates would remain at present levels at least
""through the summer of 2019"". Draghi completed the picture by
adding there had been no discussion of extending stimulus. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels over the
debt-laden country's expansionary budget.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.
    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added.

President Mario Draghi said on Thursday the longer Brexit talks
drag on, the more the private sector will have to prepare for
the possibility of Britain crashing out of the European Union
with no deal on their future relations.
    London and Brussels say they are close to an agreement, but
they have yet to resolve their differences over the future of
the Irish border, Britain's only land border with the EU.

    Draghi told reporters after an ECB policy-setting meeting he
was confident that ""a good, common-sense solution will be found
where financial stability risks will be minimised"".
    But he also outlined the growing problem that companies face
as Britain's March 2019 exit date nears with no clear idea yet

    ""If this lack of outcome will continue and will approach the
end date, the private sector itself will have to prepare on the
assumption that there will be a hard Brexit,"" he said.

necessarily big financial stability risks, but certainly
uneasiness, financial uneasiness in markets and financial
intermediaries,"" he said.

    By Marc Jones
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - European and U.S. markets
attempted a rebound on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day
since 2011 and heavy losses in Asia gave global stocks another
boot towards their worst month since the financial crisis.
    It was far from plain sailing. Germany's DAX  <.GDAX> had
hit a near two-year low and London's FTSE <.FTSE> and Paris's
CAC 40 <.FCHI> both brushed 1 1/2-year lows early on after Japan
had plummeted overnight [.T], but a semblance of stability was
emerging. [.EU]
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was darting in and out
of positive territory, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> and Dow Jones
<.DJI> both climbed 0.7 and the tech heavy Nasdaq <.IXIC>
bounced 1.5 percent, having lost 8 to 9 percent this month. [.N]
    Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc <CHF=> and
Japanese yen <JPY=> safety trades [/FRX] and Italian and Spanish
bonds held their ground as Mario Draghi reiterated the European
Central Bank's plans to carefully remove its stimulus. [GVD/EUR]
    ""Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in
emerging markets and financial market volatility remain
prominent,"" Draghi said at the ECB's post-meeting news
conference.
    ""Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed,"" he
said. But there was also an important summary. ""Is this
(turbulence) enough to change our baseline scenario? No"", adding
that he expected an agreement between Italy and Brussels on
Rome's disputed budget plans.
    Investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty stock
prices, faster interest rate hikes in the United States, Italy 
and a Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth.
    Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI's global
equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> are now in bear-market territory --
down 20 percent or more from their most recent peaks.
[nL8N1X36CB]
    There has also been growing concerns about overspending by
Italy's new populist coalition.  
    More woes in Asia overnight had seen the global wipeout on
the MSCI World since January near $7 trillion. Pan Asia-Pacific
shares <.MIAPJ0000PUS> skidded more than 2 percent while Japan's
Nikkei <.N225> tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low.
[nL3N1X51KR][.T]
    The one relief was that Chinese shares managed to close in
the black after dropping as much as 2.5 percent at one point.
<.SSEC> Fresh government support measures had failed to ease
worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the United
States. [nL3N1X51LA][nH9N1WZ024]
    ""If you're a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget,
there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms
of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,"" said Jim McCafferty, head
of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.
   
    TALKING TURKEY
    Europe's stabilisation was aided by results from Swiss bank
UBS and engineering giant ABB <ABBN.S> which helped take the
edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning
from the U.S. behemoth Caterpillar <CAT.N>. [nL3N1X44CY]
    Wall Street snapped its six-day losing streak as reassuring
results from Microsoft and strong advertising revenues from
Twitter. <TWTR.N> brought some timely cheer to tech stocks. [.N]
    Google-parent Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> were
both up more than 2.2 percent ahead of their results later too,
while wider economy watchers were reassured as the number of
Americans receiving benefits fell to a more than 45-year low.
    The ECB's ""steady as she goes"" message came after weak euro
zone economic data this week added to angst over world growth,
and a surprising slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested
rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing.
[nL2N1X31LR]
    It was not just the ECB in action, either. Turkey, which has
stabilised in recent weeks after having been at the centre of
emerging market troubles, halted its recent rate hikes in a move
that, for once, did not unsettle markets.
    In fact, the lira gained. The bank has almost doubled its
rates already this year to 24 percent after a 40 percent slump
in the Turkish currency <TRY=> pushed Ankara to the brink of a
full-blown currency crisis. [nL8N1WY2EY]   
    In the main foreign exchange markets, the euro recovered to
$1.1410 <EUR=>, having breached a long-standing bulwark of
$1.1430. 
    Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a
nine-week peak to 96.339 <.DXY>. For the first time in days it
was barely budged against the safety-first Japanese yen at
112.28 yen <JPY=>. [USD/]
    Sterling also inched off a seven-week trough to $1.2887
<GBP=>, having dropped 0.8 percent overnight, and oil prices
began to tick up again, having been dragged down in recent
sessions by the concerns over global growth.
    Brent crude <LCOc1> was last at $76.50 a barrel, while U.S.
crude was at $66.63 <CLc1> [O/R]. Safe-haven gold <XAU=> was a
tad weaker at $1,236.76 an ounce. 
    ""Expect spirited rallies,"" said Robin Bieber, technical
analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro reversed earlier gains
and fell on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario
Draghi said the monetary union remained fragile and failed to
assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy.  
    A rally in the U.S. dollar after a positive opening on Wall
Street also exacerbated euro weakness. The greenback rose to new
two-month highs against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. 
    Draghi had earlier lifted the single currency when he
expressed confidence about inflation reaching the bank's target.
The policy statement was light on new details and market moves
were small as Draghi stuck to the script for the bank's plan to
end quantitative easing gradually. [nDRAGHI][nL8N1X56JH]
    But concern about the risk of contagion from surging
borrowing costs in Italy - triggered by Rome's spending plans -
loomed large.
    ""There were no new details on monetary policy but the big
question asked was whether the ECB would use its tool kit to
respond to problems in Italy? He didn't answer that question.
Markets are slightly unnerved,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a
currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Rome's budget plans.
    Acknowledging the recent weaker momentum in the euro area
economy, he also reeled off what he called a ""bunch of
uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism, emerging markets
and financial market volatility. [nL8N1X55FN]
    Draghi also said the euro zone monetary union remained
""fragile"".  
    The euro fell to as low as $1.1370, down 0.2 percent on the
session, after trading as high as $1.1433. <EUR=EBS>.
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield gave up earlier
rises to trade flat on the day at 0.39 percent after the ECB
press conference <DE10YT=RR>. Some upward momentum also came
from U.S. Treasury yields which inched higher as the equity
selloff abated. 
    Italian government bond yields rose five basis points off
session lows but were still sharply down on the day. Its 10-year
yield was last at 3.53 percent, after earlier falling as low as
3.48 percent <IT5YT=RR>.
    Pan-European stock indexes fell into the red as Draghi spoke
before pulling higher when U.S. markets opened.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mediobanca <MDBI.MI>
is the outlier of Italy’s banking scene. The Milan-based bank’s
forecast-beating quarterly earnings suggest it has been almost
immune to this year’s sovereign bond market rout. It also has
few bad loans and high liquidity. Hence it can probably grab
market share from rivals that are more exposed to Italy’s
volatile political environment.
    Italy’s best-known investment bank, which has over the past
decade embraced wealth management and consumer banking, on
Thursday reported net profit of 245 million euros, above
consensus. It also has an unchanged common equity Tier 1 capital
ratio of 14.2 percent thanks to its relatively low direct
exposure to Italian government bonds. At 2.8 billion euros,
Mediobanca’s sovereign holdings represent 40 percent of CET1
against 90 percent for Italian rivals on average. This insulates
it from bond gyrations triggered by the spending plans of
Italy’s new populist government.
    A 100 basis point hike in the gap between Italian government
bond rates and their German equivalent lops only about 8 basis
points off Mediobanca’s CET1, the bank says, against the 35 to
40 basis points for peers cited by Fidentiis. A widening of the
spread from 310 basis points currently to 500 – a “danger zone”
that was reached during the 2011 euro zone crisis – would knock
a mere 0.16 percent from Mediobanca’s CET1. That puts it at the
back of the queue in terms of potential Italian bank forced
capital-raisers.
    Mediobanca is also relatively shielded from another
headache: writedowns on sour exposures. Its gross share of dud
loans is 4.5 percent of the total, against an estimated average
of 11 percent for Italian banks. Finally, 10 billion euros of
assets eligible for European Central Bank funding should provide
at least two years of liquidity in a crisis.
    As such a recent 20 percent share slide seems overdone. The
bank is trading at 0.74 times its tangible book value, below the
0.82 times average of large euro zone banks despite its 10
percent return on tangible equity. Investors should be looking
to own the equity, or even buy the bank, if they are inclined to
think positively about Italy’s finances. But there aren’t many
of those right now.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italy’s Mediobanca on Oct. 25 reported a net profit of 245
million euros for the quarter ending in September, higher than a
company-provided consensus of 220 million euros. Net profit was
down 18 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, which
included a capital gain from asset sales.
    - The bank reported a transitional common equity Tier 1
capital ratio (CET1) of 14.2 percent, stable from the end of
June despite rising interest rates in Italian sovereign bonds.
The impact on the ratio from a sharp fall in Italian government
bonds prices in the period was 2 basis points.
    - The bank said its direct exposure to Italian government
bonds was 2.8 billion euros, equal to about 40 percent of its
CET1 ratio.
    - Mediobanca shares have fallen almost 20 percent since a
March 4 general election that brought into power a populist
coalition in Italy. The shares were up 4.5 percent to 7.82 euros
at 1108 GMT on Oct. 25.

    By Tommy Wilkes and Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro reversed earlier gains
and fell on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario
Draghi said Europe's monetary union remained fragile and failed
to assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy.  
    A rally in the U.S. dollar after a positive opening on Wall
Street exacerbated euro weakness. The dollar rose to new
two-month highs against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. 
    Draghi had earlier lifted the single currency when he
expressed confidence inflation would reach the bank's target.
The policy statement was light on new details and market moves
were small as Draghi stuck to the script for the bank's plan to
end quantitative easing gradually. [nDRAGHI][nL8N1X56JH]
    But concern about the risk of contagion from surging
borrowing costs in Italy - triggered by Rome's spending plans -
loomed large.
    ""There were no new details on monetary policy, but the big
question asked was whether the ECB would use its tool kit to
respond to problems in Italy. He didn't answer that question.
Markets are slightly unnerved,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a
currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Rome's budget plans.
    Acknowledging the weaker momentum in the euro area economy,
he also reeled off what he called a ""bunch of uncertainties""
related to trade protectionism, emerging markets and financial
market volatility. [nL8N1X55FN] And he said the monetary union
remained ""fragile"".  
    The euro fell to as low as $1.1370, down 0.2 percent on the
session, after trading as high as $1.1433. <EUR=EBS>.
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield gave up earlier
rises to trade flat on the day at 0.39 percent after the ECB
press conference <DE10YT=RR>. Some upward momentum also came
from U.S. Treasury yields, which inched higher as this week's
equity tumble abated. 
    Italian government bond yields rose five basis points off
session lows during Draghi's comments but remained down on the
day. Its 10-year yield was last at 3.53 percent, after earlier
falling as low as 3.48 percent <IT5YT=RR>.
    ""He did a pretty good job of communicating the ECB is still
on track to remove stimulus but is at the same time monitoring
the risks without panicking or downplaying the situation,"" said
DZ Bank analyst Pascal Segesser. 
    ""He also said if markets and price stability is hurt there
would be measures they could take, tools they could use."" 
    Pan-European stock indexes fell into the red as Draghi spoke
before pulling higher when U.S. markets opened.

    By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy would need to secure a
bailout from the European Union if it is to receive any help
from the European Central Bank to bring down its borrowing costs
on financial markets, the ECB's President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday.
    The European Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget
this week, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending,
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face
disciplinary action. [nL8N1X42NA]
    Draghi, himself an Italian, reaffirmed he was ""confident""
that Rome would eventually reach an agreement with the
Commission and end a standoff that has sent investors fleeing
Italian bonds. 
    But, confirming what sources had told Reuters earlier this
month, Draghi added the ECB would come to Italy's rescue if the
country subscribed to an adjustment programme with the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) -- political parlance for a bailout
with strict policy prescriptions. [nL8N1WS11V]
    This would clear the way for the ECB to buy Italian bonds on
the market via so called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) --
a tool announced at the height of the debt crisis in 2012 and
yet unused.
    ""What is available for the ECB towards a specific country is
OMT,"" Draghi told a press conference after a meeting of the
ECB's policy-making Governing Council.
    ""And the OMT is subject to having a programme with ESM and
is also subject to the assessment by the Governing Council that
the undertaking of the OMT doesn't prejudge the monetary policy
for the whole of the euro area,"" he added.
    Italy's bond yields hit a 4-1/2 year high last week as
investors worried that the row between Rome and the Commission
might eventually push the euro zone's third-largest economy
outside the currency bloc.
    Italy's European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona said earlier
this month he was confident that, if necessary, Draghi would
""take care of things"" and ""prevent another grave crisis in
Europe"". [nR1N1RB024]
    But Draghi stressed it wasn't the ECB's job to bankroll
governments.
    ""Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits or adhering to a fiscal
dominance situation,"" he told the news conference. 
    The ECB's goal is keeping inflation in the euro zone close
to, but below 2 percent a year.
    With Draghi seeing ""limited"" spillover to other countries'
bonds from the Italian rout, the ECB confirmed on Thursday its
plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme at the
end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time
since 2011 sometime after next summer. [nL8N1X56JH]
    Draghi warned that the sell-off in Italian government bonds
was set to dent the capital of the country's banks, which own
some 375 billion euros worth of that paper. 
    But the central banker also sought to strike a constructive
tone on the Italian situation. He quoted European Commission
Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, who was also at the ECB
meeting, as saying: ""We have to observe and apply fiscal rules.
But we are also seeking a dialogue.""

    * Credit squeeze could derail govt plan to spur economy

    By Valentina Za, Andrea Mandala and Giulio Piovaccari
    MILAN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy's banks are charging
households and businesses more to borrow after a fall in the
value of the country's bonds, the first sign of a credit
tightening that could disrupt the populist government's economic
revival plans.
    Investors have been dumping Italian assets since the
formation in June of a coalition government whose draft 2019
budget plan this month prompted Moody's to cut Italy's credit
rating and the European Commission to demand a revision.
    Data reviewed by Reuters shows interest rates on mortgages
and loans are creeping higher, while some firms say banks are
demanding repayment as falling government bond prices eat into
their capital and rising yields lift funding costs. 
    This has rung alarm bells in Rome and beyond, with Italian
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria saying that current bond yields,
which are near a 4-1/2 year high on the benchmark 10-year
maturity, could not be sustained for long because of the threat
to weaker banks. [nS8N1RT020]
    Meanwhile, Italy, as the euro zone's third-largest economy,
is seen as crucial to the wider stability of the currency bloc
because it is widely regarded as too big to be rescued.
    European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday Italian banks' woes were bound to affect lending terms
though the rise in loan rates was still moderate.[nL8N1X55FN] 
    But in the longer-term, higher borrowing costs could dent
support for the populist government, which is riding high in
opinion polls and has included a ""citizens' salary"" for poorer
Italians in the budget as part of its plan to help the economy.
    Meanwhile, the interest rate on some fixed-rate mortgages -
by far the most common type in Italy - increased by as much as
20 basis points in the first 10 days of October, Ivano Cresto,
of price-comparison website Facile.it, said.
    That partly reflects a rise in the benchmark rate for such
mortgages - set at a European level - but also the so-called
spread banks apply on top to offset higher funding costs,
banking sources told Reuters. https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rd61IB
    Italy's top two banks, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and
UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, both said they had raised the cost of
fixed-rate mortgages after the summer by up to 20 basis points.
    ""Intesa and UniCredit have often proved to be first movers
in the mortgage market,"" said Roberto Anedda, head of marketing
at mortgage data website MutuiOnline.it.
    
    RUSH TO BUY
    Worried about further rate rises, some people are rushing to
buy properties even if it means allowing the seller to continue
to live there for a period after the purchase, bank staff said.
    A 20 bp interest rate increase would add up to 2,800 euros
in payments to an average mortgage of around 124,000 euros over
20 years, the most common duration, Reuters calculations based
on MutuiOnline data show.
    Italy's ABI banking association declined to comment,
although a spokesman pointed to its data for September, before
the budget was presented, which showed the average rate on new
home mortgages and corporate loans edging lower.
    Although central bank liquidity has shielded Italian banks
from the full impact of rising rates, the ECB has begun
unwinding its ultra-loose monetary policy.
     ""The (transmission) chain is long,"" a top executive at an
Italian bank said, referring to the mechanism through which
higher funding costs for banks lead to pricier loans and
shrinking capital buffers curtail their lending capacity.
    ""But we're beginning to witness the first signs,"" he added.
    Businesses are also starting to feel the heat and the Bank
of Italy has said companies surveyed in September had signalled
a slight worsening in credit conditions. 
    ""We haven't closed any important credit lines recently, but
the banks say they would charge an extra 80-100 basis points on
10-year loans compared to levels we'd been discussing at the
start of the summer,"" Fabio Pezzani, head of finance at GVM Care
& Research, a healthcare group based near Ravenna, told Reuters.
    Pezzani said the increase on short-term funding was limited
to an extra 10-15 basis points in the spread over the benchmark.
    ""For the time being, I think it's just a matter of a higher
cost of funding ... from next year, I fear we'll also have a
problem of ... tighter credit offer,"" Pezzani said.
    
    SELECTIVE LOANS
    During the euro zone crisis of 2011-2012, when bank
liquidity dried up and Italian government bond yields topped 7
percent, a credit crunch exacerbated a recession that wiped out
a quarter of Italy's industrial output.
    A person in charge of corporate lending at a local bank in
southern Italy, where default rates are higher, said they had
considered raising loan rates charged to firms by 200 basis
points this month.
    The owner of a small fruit and vegetable business from
Italy's southern Apulia region said that he had been forced to
repay an up to 80,000 euro overdraft.         
    ""They said they no longer wanted to support an agricultural
business because it is seasonal,"" he told Reuters.
    ""But I insisted, and said I had always paid regularly, so
eventually they told me markets were bad with bond yields rising
and the outlook for the next few months so unpredictable ...
that they had to take precautions.""
    Corporate lending, which shrank steadily between mid-2012
and mid-2016, has recovered moderately since but banks have
become more selective after they saw nearly a fifth of their
loans turn sour in the last recession.
    ""Banks' concerns over souring loans are one of the main
reasons small firms see their credit curtailed or altogether
revoked,"" said Antonio Pinto, a lawyer with consumer association
Confconsumatori.

    * Risk assessment maintained

 (Adds detail, economists)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
stuck to plans on Thursday to claw back unprecedented stimulus,
even as the growth outlook continues to darken and political
turmoil in Italy looms large over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($3
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    While he acknowledged a loss of growth momentum and a ""bunch
of uncertainties"" from trade protectionism and market
volatility, ECB President Mario Draghi played down concerns,
arguing that the euro zone was merely returning to a normal or
natural pace of expansion after an exceptional 2017.
    ""We're talking about weaker momentum, not a downturn,""
Draghi told a news conference after policymakers decided to
maintain a long-standing assessment that growth risks were
""broadly balanced"". 
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he said, adding that the ECB did
not even contemplate extending its bond purchase programme,
which has depressed borrowing costs and revived growth. 
    The comments appeared to confirm already solid expectations
that the ECB will not go back on its pledge to end bond
purchases by the close of the year, even if the growth outlook
continues to weaken. 
    ""The ECB remains highly determined to bring net asset
purchases to an end,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""It
would require a severe downturn of the economy, not only weaker
momentum, in the coming six weeks for the ECB to alter its
course."" 
    Focusing on inflation, the bank's primary mandate, Draghi
struck a positive tone, arguing that wage growth was a ""very
comforting"" sign and that policymakers remained confident that
price growth will rise.
    But despite the hawkish message -- which included an upbeat
assessment of firmer wage pressures -- the euro slipped on his
comment that Europe's monetary union remained ""fragile"" as long
as measures to shore up existing structures were not complete.
    ""And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean
the capital market union,"" he added of measures initiated as a
result of the sovereign debt crisis of almost a decade ago but
which have foundered on a lack of consensus among member states.
    The single currency slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.138
after having earlier reached a session-high of $1.143.
      
    ITALY
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels. He made it
abundantly clear that the ECB would not come to Italy's aid.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. 
    """"Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits,"" Draghi said. 
    He said rising bond yields were already eating into Italy's
fiscal capacity, suggesting that attempts to raise spending
would be counterproductive as investors will punish Rome for
spending too much.
    With a debt to GDP ratio of 130 percent, Italy is the euro
zone's second most indebted country after Greece, and under its
rejected budget proposal, this debt level is unlikely to fall. 

    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.
    Economists said the message to Rome was clear: that the ECB
will not come to its aid and it should prepare for life after
years of central bank support. 
    ""The ECB is not about to run to Italy's rescue, even if
market conditions deteriorated further,"" Nordea economist Jan
von Gerich said.

    By Sinéad Carew
    NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks followed Europe
higher on Thursday after investors ventured into risky bets
again with encouragement from some strong earnings and the
dollar rose against the euro after remarks from Europe's Central
Bank chief fueled fears about the monetary union.
    Oil prices stabilized after an early sell-off as investors
returned their focus to the fundamentals of supply and demand as
equity markets regained some lost ground. [nL3N1X52LS]
    The greenback rose against the euro after the ECB's Mario
Draghi reaffirmed that its 2.6-trillion euro ($2.97 trillion)
asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates
could rise after next summer even though the economic outlook
has darkened and political turmoil looms in Italy. [nL8N1X56JH]
    While equity investors sought bargains and some were
reassured by positive earnings and stronger technology stocks,
they also voiced caution. 
    ""There's a sense of nervousness and caution because a lot of
people were caught off guard by the drop yesterday,"" Scott
Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg,
Florida said. 
    ""At this point it's all about sentiment. People are looking
for things to settle down and I think we need to see more
concrete evidence of that.""
    Wall Street was helped by reassuring results from Microsoft
Corp <MSFT.O> and strong advertising revenues from Twitter Inc
<TWTR.N>. Google-parent Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Amazon.com
<AMZN.O> were among the top boosters of the S&P ahead of their
results later. [nL3N1X55IG] 
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 375.12 points,
or 1.53 percent, to 24,958.54, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 47.06
points, or 1.77 percent, to 2,703.16 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 196.21 points, or 2.76 percent, to 7,304.61.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was darting in and out
of positive territory. It rose 0.51 percent and MSCI's gauge of
stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.70 percent.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Rome's budget plans, but
the euro reversed earlier gains after he said the monetary union
remained fragile. [nL8N1X57HB]
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.18 percent, with the euro
<EUR=> down 0.15 percent to $1.1374.
    Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc <CHF=> and
Japanese yen <JPY=> safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds
held their ground as Draghi reiterated the European Central
Bank's plans to carefully remove its stimulus. [nL8N1X53ZM]
    The Japanese yen weakened 0.28 percent versus the greenback
at 112.61 per dollar, while Sterling <GBP=> was last trading at
$1.2823, down 0.44 percent on the day.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 1.22 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> lost 3.72 percent. [nL3N1X52Q4]
    But in China, the Shanghai SE Composite index <.SSEC>
managed to eke out a tiny gain after dropping as much as 2.8
percent at one point. [nL3N1X51LA] [nH9N1WZ024] 
    Investors were also eyeing mixed U.S. economic data. 
    New applications for U.S. unemployment aid rose last week,
but the number of Americans receiving benefits fell to more than
a 45-year low, pointing to tightening labor market conditions.
[nUSNPLEEMN]
     But new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell for a
second straight month in September and the goods trade deficit
increased further amid rising imports, suggesting economic
growth moderated in the third quarter. [nL2N1X41XN] 
    Benchmark 10-year Treasuries <US10YT=RR> last fell 4/32 in
price to yield 3.1375 percent, from 3.124 percent late on
Wednesday.  [nL2N1X50UP]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> rose 1.03 percent to $67.51 per barrel
and Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $76.82, up 0.85 percent on the
day. [nL3N1X52LS]

 (Recasts with euro at 2-month low, updates prices)
    By Kate Duguid
    NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month
low on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi said the bank would pursue its tightening policy in spite
of fears about the monetary union's economic and political
future.
    The ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and that 
interest rates could rise after next summer. The policy guidance
has been consistent since June, even though the economic outlook
has darkened while political turmoil in Italy looms over the
currency bloc. [nL8N1X56JH]
    Although Draghi said he was confident the European
Commission and Rome would reach a compromise over Italy's budget
plans, he failed to allay concerns about the risk of contagion
from surging borrowing costs.
    The single currency <EUR=> rose immediately after the
central bank's rates announcement, then began to sell off ""once
Draghi started speaking again and highlighted the risks around
Italy and Brexit,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing
and trading at Tempus, Inc. 
    Doyle said the euro's decline was the primary reason for
Thursday's jump in the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the
greenback's performance against a basket of six major
currencies. It was amplified, however, by the rise in U.S.
stocks at the opening bell after a sell-off on Wednesday, which
pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased all the
year's gains on the S&P 500 <.SPX> and the Dow <DJI.>.
[nL3N1X55HN]
    Against the dollar, the euro fell to $1.1361, its lowest
since Aug. 16. The single currency was last down 13 basis points
on the day. The dollar index hit a two-month high of 96.681,
last up 27 basis points from the open.
    Sterling hit a six-week bottom of $1.281 <GBP=> after Draghi
said the longer Brexit talks drag on, the more the private
sector must prepare for the possibility that Britain could exit
the European Union with no deal on future relations.
[nL8N1X57M7]
    Elsewhere, the Japanese yen <JPY=> weakened, although the
Swiss franc <CHF=>, a rival safe-haven currency, gained. 
    The yen weakened to as much as 112.63 against the dollar,
but nevertheless remained up 1.7 percent from its 2018 trough
hit on Oct. 3.
    The Swiss franc spiked against the dollar following the
Draghi announcement to trade as high as $1.002 <CHF=> and
strengthened by 16 basis points against the euro <EURCHF=>.
    The Australian dollar, often viewed as a bellwether for
global risk, rose 0.26 percent to $0.708 <AUD=>. However, in a
sign that worries about global growth, particularly in China,
are beginning to bite, the offshore yuan <CNH=> hit a 22-month
low, last at 6.954.

considering giving itself extra wiggle room when rolling over
its holdings of government debt next year to ensure it always
finds bonds to buy when the old ones mature, two sources close
to the matter told Reuters.
    Earlier on Thursday, the ECB confirmed plans to stop adding
to its 2 trillion euro ($2.27 trillion) sovereign debt stash at
year-end as it sees inflation recovering, but it reaffirmed a
pledge to reinvest cash from expiring bonds for a long time.
    This won't be easy as not every issue that matures is
immediately replaced by new supply from the same country --
particularly in Germany, where the government runs a budget
surplus and the ECB bought many short-term bonds.
    For this reason, ECB policymakers want to give themselves
more than the current three months to reinvest the proceeds from
maturing bonds, the sources said.
    One added the issue was now being studied by the central
bank's staff. ECB President Mario Draghi said a decision on
reinvestment would be announced at the central bank's December
13 meeting.
    An ECB spokesperson declined to comment. 
    Currently, the ECB and the euro zone's 19 national central
banks, which carry out the bulk of the Public Sector Purchase
Programme, have up to three months to recycle cash repaid as
bonds mature back into the same jurisdiction.
    When redemptions have been large, this has resulted in
deviations from the ECB's capital key, which dictates that
government bonds should be bought in proportion to how much
capital each national central bank has paid into ECB coffers.
    In one notable instance, massive redemptions of German debt
in April resulted in the ECB purchasing more paper from Spain,
Italy and France that month to plug the gap, only to make up for
it in May.
    According to Allianz estimates, around 165 billion euros of
government bonds bought as part of the PSPP are due to mature
next year, 30 percent of which are in Germany, 20 percent in
France and just over 15 percent in Italy.

 (Adds material from sources)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
stuck to plans on Thursday to claw back unprecedented stimulus,
even as the growth outlook continues to darken and political
turmoil in Italy looms large over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($3
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    It also renewed a pledge to reinvest cash from maturing
bonds for a long time and sources told Reuters the ECB was
aiming for more wiggle room to ensure it always finds enough
paper to buy even when redemptions are large. [nL8N1X58YG]
    While he acknowledged a loss of growth momentum and a ""bunch
of uncertainties"" from trade protectionism and market
volatility, ECB President Mario Draghi played down concerns,
arguing that the euro zone was merely returning to a normal or
natural pace of expansion after an exceptional 2017.
    ""We're talking about weaker momentum, not a downturn,""
Draghi told a news conference after policymakers decided to
maintain a long-standing assessment that growth risks were
""broadly balanced"". 
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he said, adding that the ECB did
not even contemplate extending its bond purchase programme,
which has depressed borrowing costs and revived growth. 
    The comments appeared to confirm already solid expectations
that the ECB will not go back on its pledge to end bond
purchases by the close of the year, even if the growth outlook
continues to weaken. 
    ""The ECB remains highly determined to bring net asset
purchases to an end,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""It
would require a severe downturn of the economy, not only weaker
momentum, in the coming six weeks for the ECB to alter its
course."" 
    
    POSITIVE TONE
    Focusing on inflation, the bank's primary mandate, Draghi
struck a positive tone, arguing that wage growth was a ""very
comforting"" sign and that policymakers remained confident that
price growth will rise.
    But despite the hawkish message -- which included an upbeat
assessment of firmer wage pressures -- the euro slipped on his
comment that Europe's monetary union remained ""fragile"" as long
as measures to shore up existing structures were not complete.
    ""And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean
the capital market union,"" he added of measures initiated as a
result of the sovereign debt crisis of almost a decade ago but
which have foundered on a lack of consensus among member states.
    The single currency slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.138
after having earlier reached a session-high of $1.143.
    Even when it stops adding to its 2.6 trillion euro stash of
bonds, the ECB will remain in the market for a long time to
replace debt that expires.
    This will not be easy as not every issue that matures is
immediately replaced by new supply from the same country --
particularly in Germany, where the government runs a budget
surplus and the ECB bought many short-term bonds.
    For this reason, ECB policymakers want to give themselves
more than the current three months to reinvest the proceeds from
maturing bonds, two sources familiar with the matter said.
    A decision is due at the ECB's Dec. 13 meeting. An ECB
spokesperson declined to comment.

    ITALY
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels. He made it
abundantly clear that the ECB would not come to Italy's aid.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. [nL8N1X57X2]
    ""Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits,"" Draghi said. 
    He said rising bond yields were already eating into Italy's
fiscal capacity, suggesting that attempts to raise spending
would be counterproductive as investors will punish Rome for
spending too much.
    With a debt to GDP ratio of 130 percent, Italy is the euro
zone's second most indebted country after Greece, and under its
rejected budget proposal, this debt level is unlikely to fall. 
    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.""
    Economists said the message to Rome was clear: that the ECB
will not come to its aid and it should prepare for life after
years of central bank support. 
    ""The ECB is not about to run to Italy's rescue, even if
market conditions deteriorated further,"" Nordea economist Jan
von Gerich said.

    By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy would need to secure a
bailout from the European Union if it is to receive any help
from the European Central Bank to bring down its borrowing costs
on financial markets, the ECB's President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday.
    The European Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget
this week, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending,
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face
disciplinary action in a standoff that has sent investors
fleeing Italian bonds. [nL8N1X42NA]
    Confirming what sources told Reuters earlier this month,
Draghi said the ECB would only come to Italy's rescue if the
country subscribed to an adjustment programme with the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) -- political parlance for a bailout
with strict policy prescriptions. [nL8N1WS11V]
    This would clear the way for the ECB to buy Italian bonds on
the market via so called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) --
a tool announced at the height of the debt crisis in 2012 and as
yet unused.
    ""What is available for the ECB towards a specific country is
OMT,"" Draghi told a press conference after a meeting of the
ECB's policy-making Governing Council.
    ""And the OMT is subject to having a programme with ESM and
is also subject to the assessment by the Governing Council that
the undertaking of the OMT doesn't prejudge the monetary policy
for the whole of the euro area,"" he added.
    Draghi also warned that the sell-off in Italian government
bonds was set to dent the capital of Italy's banks, which own
about 375 billion euros ($426.30 billion) worth of that paper. 
    Italy's European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona responded to
Draghi later on Thursday, saying it was up to the ECB ""to
intervene should there be a crisis in the banking sector"".
[nR1N1X4008]  
    Italy's bond yields hit a 4-1/2 year high last week as
investors worried that the row between Rome and the Commission
might eventually push the euro zone's third-largest economy
outside the currency bloc.
    Savona had said earlier this month he was confident that, if
necessary, Draghi would ""take care of things"" and ""prevent
another grave crisis in Europe"". [nR1N1RB024]
    But Draghi stressed it wasn't the ECB's job to bankroll
governments.
    ""Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits or adhering to a fiscal
dominance situation,"" he told the news conference. 
    The ECB's goal is keeping inflation in the euro zone close
to, but below two percent a year.
    With Draghi seeing ""limited"" spillover to other countries'
bonds from the Italian rout, the ECB confirmed on Thursday its
plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme at the
end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time
since 2011 sometime after next summer. [nL8N1X56JH]
    But the central banker also sought to strike a constructive
tone on the Italian situation, saying he was ""confident"" that
Rome would eventually reach an agreement with the Commission.
     He also quoted European Commission Vice President Valdis
Dombrovskis, who was also at the ECB meeting, as saying: ""We
have to observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking
a dialogue.""

2328,5708,f5df6d763dcafed59fd139fcf89cbe5c,German consumers keen to spend in Nov even as economic expectations darken - GfK survey,2018-10-26 14:00:04,EUR,0,2018-10-26 14:00:58,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - German shoppers look keen to
spend in November, but their expectations for the economy and
their own personal income have slipped on worries about
international trade conflicts and Brexit, a survey showed on
Friday.
    Household spending has become the main source of expansion
in Europe's biggest economy in recent years, backed by
record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation
pay hikes and low borrowing costs.
    The Nuremberg-based GfK institute said its consumer climate
indicator remained unchanged going into November compared with
October at an index level of 10.6 points, slightly above a
Reuters poll consensus view of 10.5.
    GfK's subindex measuring propensity to buy rose further in
October, to 55.9 points, mainly prompted by a general feeling of
job security, prompting consumers to make larger purchases, GfK
said.
    ""Apparently unfazed by external risks such as trade
conflicts and Brexit, consumers are prepared to splash out.
After all, saving is still not an attractive alternative,"" GfK
researcher Rolf Buerkl said. 
    The sub-index measuring economic expectations, however,
dropped 8.1 points to 19.0.
    ""This is primarily due to external factors,"" Buerkl said. 
    ""The trade conflict between the USA and the EU has not been
fully resolved despite a period of calm, while the dispute with
China has even escalated,"" he said, adding that this was highly
unlikely to inspire consumer optimism. 
    The GfK survey was conducted from Oct. 5 to Oct. 19.

    
                                 NOV 18    OCT 18    NOV 17
 Consumer climate                10.6      10.6      10.8
 Consumer climate components     OCT 18    SEPT 18   OCT 17
 - willingness to buy            55.9      52.9      59.2

 - business cycle expectations   19.0      27.1      43.5
 
    NOTE - The consumer climate indicator forecasts the
development of real private consumption in the following month.
    An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth
in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop
compared with the same period a year ago.
    According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator
corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private
consumption.
    The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance
between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you
think now is a good time to buy major items?""
    The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations
about the development of household finances in the coming 12
months.
    The additional business cycle expectations index reflects
the assessment of those questioned of the general economic
situation in the next 12 months.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A regional election in the large
German state of Hesse this weekend is the latest hazard for
Angela Merkel's bickering coalition government, with both her
conservatives and her centre-left SPD partners expected to shed
votes. For the SPD in particular, its declining poll fortunes
are becoming an existential crisis - so much so that it has
started asking whether it should step back into opposition.
Merkel's party is warning the SPD that it would likely call a
snap election in that case - something which opinion polls
suggest would be devastating for the two mainstream parties. In
Hesse, much of the focus will be on the performance of the
far-right AfD, but particularly the resurgent Greens, whose
charismatic half-Yemeni leader could turn out to be the
kingmaker in forming the next regional government there.
    Austria is using its role as the current holder of the EU
presidency to call for an arms ban on Saudi Arabia in the wake
of Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Germany, which has already said it
is halting its relatively modest arms supplies to the Saudis, is
in favour: the question is how more major suppliers such as the
UK and France respond. The UK's scheduled departure from the EU
means it would not in any case have to join any EU move on the
matter; France could block it if it chose. President Emmanuel
Macron told Saudi King Salman on Wednesday that France could
take action against those held responsible for the murder.
However, since coming to power last year Macron has largely
ignored protests over arms sales he deems vital to jobs and
France's strategic relationships in the region. 
    
MARKETS AT 6.55 GMT
    So last night’s Wall Street rise was probably a dead-cat
bounce after all. Asian markets are a sea of red this morning,
Europe is opening weaker and U.S. futures are sharply lower. We
had less than scintillating earnings from Amazon and Google,
which led to an after-hours slides by their shares, and markets
are also worrying about China where despite stock markets are
down sharply and the yuan is sliding towards the key 7 per
dollar mark  -- it reached 6.98, the weakest since January 2017
and brought out the PBOC this morning to threaten ""targeted
steps"" against those shorting CNY and promise macro-prudential
measures. 
    But there is also the issue of central bank policy
tightening – the ECB’s Mario Draghi signalled yesterday it is
unlikely the bank will hold off removing stimulus by year-end
despite signs of slowing growth and the troubles in Italy. 
    With the economic growth picture darkening, attention will
focus today on U.S. third-quarter GDP. Some investors reckon the
tailwinds from tax cuts and repatriation are already weakening,
as highlighted by the recent lacklustre durable-goods orders.  
    World stocks are set for a fifth straight week of losses, 
the longest losing streak since 2013, and look on track for
their worst month in seven years. The S&P500 is just 1 percent
off losing all its gains for the year. Emerging-market equities
are down 20 percent and heading for their worst year since 2011
and worst month since May 2012. With more earnings due,
including from emerging-market-focused consumer goods bellwether
Colgate Palmolive and industrials such as Goodyear Tyres and
Rockwell Collins, investors are hypersensitive to the
beats/misses but also to forward guidance from companies. All
those fears are pushing investors back into bonds, with U.S.
10-year yields down towards one-month lows, while  German yields
are at the lowest since Sept. 10, having slipped 11 basis points
this week.  
    Italian yields are up before Italy’s rating review by S&P.
Views are mixed on what will happen, but hopes are the agency
will content itself with merely downgrading the outlook on the
rating to negative, leaving it two notches above investment
grade. It may cut the rating and keep the outlook stable – also
not too bad. On the Brexit front, a source-based Bloomberg
report that said talks had stalled sent sterling briefly lower
overnight but it’s flat now and awaiting more headlines. Other
currencies are reflecting the risk off – yen and Swiss franc
have risen, the Australian dollar and emerging currencies are
lower. The dollar hit 2 1/2-month highs yesterday but is now
flat. Oil prices are set for  a third weekly loss, shedding 4
percent so far this week.
    On European stocks, it looks set to be a day of heavy losses
– down 1 percent or more across various bourses- after U.S.
futures tumbled following results from Amazon and Alphabet and
prompting renewed concern about the dominance of tech in this
market cycle. Car parts maker Valeo could fall the most, though
- it's indicated down as much as 10 percent after its results
missed estimates by 22 percent and it slashed guidance for next
year by 11 percent. The warnings echoed Daimler’s and others in
the auto sector flagging disruption from tougher European
emissions tests and slower sales in China, and the sector could
be bruised as a result. 
    Stronger results from British Airways owner IAG could help
the travel and leisure sector, which has been under pressure
with airlines warning of fuel costs rising. With some analysts
citing a report Brexit talks are in deadlock, Britain’s FTSE 100
will be a focus and has opened 1 percent lower. RBS shares are
down 4 percent after it said it had taken a 100 million-pound
impairment provision to account for greater economic
uncertainty, the first concrete sign Brexit is clouding the
outlook for banks. Healthcare could also be under pressure after
U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to base Medicare
drug prices on lower overseas rates. Of the Europe-listed pharma
names, Roche, Ipsen, Grifols and UCB have the biggest exposure
to the U.S. Medicare Part B, according to Goldman Sachs. Spanish
bank Sabadell has jumped 5.5 percent after better-than-expected
results
    In company news and stock movers: Britain's RBS puts cash
aside, warns of economic uncertainty; BA owner IAG's Q3 profit
slightly beats market estimates; Volvo Cars Q3 income falls due
to launch costs, higher tariffs; Spain's Caixabank Q3 net profit
down 27.6 percent due to Repsol sale; aAsset manager Amundi
reports higher Q3 profits; Signify beats expectations with 8
percent rise in Q3 core profit; UBS CEO Ermotti won't rule out
M&A, says options are limited; Volkswagen readies truck business
Traton for stock market listing; Brewer Ambev squeezed by Brazil
competition, Argentina inflation; AIG receives UK approval for
Brexit restructure; Freenet open to offers for its $1 billion
stake in Sunrise; NordLB stake sale sparks merger talks among
German public sector banks; Lufthansa eyes divestments of
non-core businesses.
    In emerging markets, two key events are due at the weekend -
the second and final round of elections in Brazil, where right-
wing Jair Bolsanaro, the market’s preferred candidate, looks
almost certain to win. Brazilian assets have been scorching hot,
so the question is whether this is a classic case of buy the
rumour, sell the election win fact – Brazil's real is up for
sixth straight week. The second is the conclusion of a public
vote in Mexico on whether to give up on its half-built, white
elephant of a new airport. It is seen as a test of incoming
President AMLO's business credentials. The Mexican peso is  down
for fourth straight week and the Turkish lira is flirting with a
third straight week of gain 
    Russia's central bank meets today and should keep rates
unchanged at 7.50 but the rouble's recent decline and rise in
inflation expectations could see a 25 bps hike from the hawkish
bank.

European Central Bank board member Coeure speaks in Paris
Norges Bank chief Olsen speaks in Trondheim

    FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Euro zone prices are expected
to continue growing at 1.7 percent per year until 2020 despite
weaker underlying inflation and economic growth, a European
Central Bank survey showed on Friday.
    The ECB confirmed a day earlier plans to wind down its 2.6
trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) stimulus programme at the end of
this year and raise interest rates sometime after next summer
because it still sees inflation holding up despite uncertainties
around growth.
    Its latest Survey of Professional Forecasters on Friday
backed up that line of thought, with unchanged expectations for
headline inflation for this year and the next two, at 1.7
percent, and in the longer term at 1.9 percent.
    But the forecasters polled by the ECB cut their estimates
for core inflation, which strips out the more volatile energy
and food prices, and economic growth for this year and the next.
    ""Respondents typically attributed their revisions to
external factors such as higher energy prices weighing on
disposable income, with many also noting ... some dampening
impact on exports and investment due to increased uncertainty
surrounding the outlook for world trade,"" the ECB said.
    The euro zone's central bank targets a headline inflation
rate ""below, but close to 2 percent"" over the medium term.
    In its survey, the ECB also noted that growth in core prices
was still accelerating, albeit now 10 basis points more slowly
at 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent the next.
    ""The expected pick-up in underlying inflation remained
underpinned by a pick-up in annual growth in compensation per
employee, which was expected to increase to 2.3 percent by
2020,"" the central bank said.

five years to sell zero-coupon paper on Friday at the first debt
sale since Moody's downgraded the country's debt to one notch
above junk status citing concerns over government budget plans.
    The 3 billion euro ($3.4 billion) sale of a new zero-coupon
bond maturing in November 2020 comes ahead of a review of
Italy's 'BBB' rating by S&P's on Friday night. 
    Italy sold the top planned amount at auction but the yield
rose to 1.626 percent versus the 0.715 rate it paid a month ago
on the previous zero-coupon benchmark which matures in May 2020.
    The risk premium Italy pays over safer German Bunds has
climbed to a 5-1/2 year high due to Rome's plans to raise next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output under a draft
budget which has been rejected by the European Commission.    
    Rome, which must submit a new budget within three weeks or
face disciplinary action, has so far refused to trim the deficit
goal. [nL8N1WS11V]
    Italy on Friday also sold 996 million euros of an
inflation-linked bond due in May 2028. The bond fetched a real
yield of 2.34 percent. It had last been sold in July at 1.55
percent.
    The Treasury will offer 6 billion euros of six-month bills
on Monday. The real market test following S&P's verdict,
however, will be Tuesday's sale of up to 5.5 billion euros in
longer term bonds. [nS8N1X5000] ($1 = 0.8793 euros)

debt
    * Revised plan could be agreed by EU envoys next week
    * Bad loans down but still saddling southern banks

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European Union states are close
to a deal on rules for banks saddled with bad loans, according
to diplomats and EU documents, with a plan that would give banks
less time to build a backstop against new soured debt.
    Euro zone banks have yet to recover from the 2008 financial
crisis, and this year their shares dropped more than 20 percent
<.SX7P>. Italian banks have fallen nearly 30 percent <.FTIT8300>
and seen increased losses after a eurosceptic government took
office in Rome in June.
    The new rules, if adopted, could cause them further trouble.
They would have only seven years, instead of eight, to build a
backstop that would fully covered new bad loans secured by
collateral, under an EU proposal seen by Reuters. 
    The plan, prepared by the Austrian presidency of the
European Union, would amend legislative proposals made by the
European Commission in March for common minimum levels of money
banks need to set aside against bad loans. [nL8N1QW3PL]
    EU governments broadly agree on the overhaul, an EU internal
document said. One negotiator said he was ""very confident"" EU
envoys would agree a compromise at a meeting next week.
    Despite a gradual offloading of bad loans, euro zone banks
still hold 731 billion euros ($831.22 billion) of debt they
might not be able to recover, according to European Banking
Authority's latest available data.
    Assets of banks that do not build a sufficient backstop
would automatically be devalued under the proposed rules. The
rules would apply only to new loans.
    ""Loopholes"" that would have allowed lenders to set aside
less money for some loans have also been eliminated from the
proposal, a diplomat involved in the negotiations said. 
           
    ITALY'S WORRIES
    In a concession to countries where banks hold higher levels
of bad debt, EU governments are backing an extension to three
years from two that banks have to cover new unsecured, riskier
loans that go bad. 
    Non-performing loans make up an average of just 3.6 percent
of total lending at EU banks. But in Greece they account for
nearly half of loans and in Italy almost 10 percent.
    Italy is pushing for nine years to build buffers against
losses on loans that are secured by immovable collateral, such
as houses or commercial properties, confidential documents show.
Southern countries back that proposal and a diplomat said it
could be accepted by all 28 governments. 
    But in return for this concession, the new measures would be
backdated to March 2018, effectively shortening the period banks
would have. Austria had proposed applying the new measures only
to new loans originated after the rules are adopted.
    The European Parliament, which would have to agree with
changes proposed by EU government, is divided over the reform,
said Roberto Gualtieri, one of the leading lawmakers on the
matter. If no agreement is reached before European elections in
May, the overhaul may be shelved.

Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - More questions are being asked
about the viability of Angela Merkel's ruling coalition in
Berlin after both parties suffered heavy losses in this
weekend's regional election in the large central state of Hesse,
home to the financial capital, Frankfurt. Merkel's left-leaning
partners, the SPD, in particular have lost all sense of
direction, with some commentators talking about an existential
threat to one of Europe's oldest political parties. Its
embattled leader, Andrea Nahles, has given Merkel an ultimatum
to produce the kind of policy results within a year that would
start bringing back voters, threatening otherwise to end the
alliance. Merkel will respond this afternoon.
    British finance minister Philip Hammond will warn hard
Brexiters in his party today that any end to unpopular austerity
measures will depend on averting a no-deal Brexit, implicitly
urging them to get behind PM Theresa May's compromise plan.
While some forecasters say such a no-deal scenario would bring
growth to a near standstill next year and push up state
borrowing, Hammond's standing with hard Brexiters in
Conservative ranks is so low that it is far from certain they
will be impressed by his warnings. He told weekend talk shows
the biggest item in this afternoon's budget would be the
increase in spending due to go to the health service, with other
measures due to include more spending on roads, a tax cut for
small retailers hammered by online competition and more spending
on broadband. 
    Standard & Poor's on Friday left Italy's sovereign debt
rating unchanged but lowered its outlook to negative from
stable, saying that the new government's policy plans were
weighing on the country's growth and debt prospects. Sheer
relief that there was no ratings downgrade has pushed Italy's
bond yields sharply lower this morning.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
Fresh worries about trade-related hits to Chinese corporate
profit growth and incoming earnings unnerved Shanghai stocks on
Monday, sending another negative pulse across Asia bourses after
a torrid week on world stock markets that saw MSCI’s all-country
global index lose almost 4 percent to its lowest in more than
year - making October so far as the worst month for global
stocks since 2011.  After weekend data showing Chinese profit
growth slowed for the fifth straight month in September, the
Shanghai-Shenzhen composite CSI300 dropped more than 3 percent
in its worst day in more than two weeks. China’s offshore yuan
weakened too, though it remained above Friday’s trough – the
weakest since January last year. Seoul’s Kospi lost more than 1
percent, Jakarta was down about half a percent and Japan’s
Nikkei was modestly in the red. Australia’s benchmark
outperformed with gains of more than 1 percent, however. 
    Although S&P500 futures were down overnight, showing little
sign of a bounce after Friday’s lunge to its lowest since May,
there were more positive signs for European stocks. The
EuroStoxx 50 opened up 0.45 percent, with a mix of positives,
from S&P Global credit rating firm declining to downgrade
Italy’s sovereign rating on Friday to indications from Germany’s
Social Democrats that they would stay in coalition with
Chancellor Merkel’s conservative for, even though both parties
saw big losses of support in weekend state elections in Hesse.
Higher-than-forecast third-quarter revenue growth from HSBC also
helped the early mood in Europe in another heavy week for
corporate earnings, and HSBC stock opened up 5 percent before
the bell. Italian bond yields fell on Monday, with 10-year
borrowing costs hitting a one-week low after S&P’s decision to
leave Italy’s rating two notches above junk territory, although
it lowered its outlook to negative to stable. Moody’s had cut
its rating the previous week. The Italian yield spread over
Germany fell to 300 basis points from 306 bps late Friday.
    Outside the region, Brazilian stocks and the real are
expected to rise after right-wing candidate Bolsorano won
Brazil’s presidential elections on Sunday. Tokyo-listed
Brazilian stock ETFs were up more than 10 percent overnight.
Elsewhere, currency markets were calmer than the equity markets,
with dollar index up marginally and both dollar/yen and
euro/dollar flat versus Friday’s closes. Sterling was also
little changed ahead of UK finance minister Philip Hammond’s
autumn budget statement later in the day. Ten-year U.S. Treasury
yields were a touch lower at 3.06 percent.  Brent crude oil
prices were down at just above $77.

    By Swaha Pattanaik
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Angela Merkel has
called time on her own tenure. The politician who has been
Germany’s chancellor for 13 years has decided to not seek
re-election as chairwoman of her party, the Christian Democrats
(CDU). While she nevertheless wants to serve her full term as
chancellor until 2021, her country and the rest of Europe will
inevitably start looking ahead to what could be a more
polarising era.
    The announcement of Merkel’s decision to give up the CDU
chair came on Monday, a day after a regional election in the
western state of Hesse saw support for the conservatives slump
by 11 percentage points. Nor was that an aberration. The
Christian Democrats’ sister party, the CSU, two weeks ago
suffered its worst result in Bavaria since 1950. Some
traditional supporters of the two parties were angered by
Merkel’s 2015 decision to welcome one million mainly Muslim
asylum seekers. The need to win back such voters may tempt the
next chair of the CDU to push the party to the right.
    But that will be hard to square with the demands of Merkel’s
junior coalition partner, the left-leaning Social Democrats
(SPD) who are also being punished by voters. The SPD’s share of
the Hesse vote fell to roughly a fifth, the worst result in the
state since 1946, and the party is under pressure to show
supporters it is achieving tangible results by staying in
government. If the CDU tacks to the right, and the SPD pulls the
other way, the current coalition will fall apart sooner rather
than later. A minority government or an alliance with the
liberal Free Democrats, who walked away from coalition talks
last year, could then be on the cards. 
    There will also be consequences for the rest of Europe if
the CDU lists to the right. A lame-duck Merkel – or her
successor – may be less tolerant of countries, such as Italy,
who flout the European Union’s budget rules. All the more so if
the CDU is trying to win back its traditional supporters, who
typically favour fiscal discipline. Merkel may be remembered for
her ability to forge consensus and act for the greater good.
Domestic political pressure means her successor is unlikely to
have that luxury.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Volatility in Italian government
debt has made it harder for Greece to return to bond markets,
Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told Reuters, but said
he is comfortable with waiting for the right time to raise
funds. 
    A recent selloff in Italian government debt has pushed up
the borrowing costs of other Southern European countries,
including Greece. 
    But Tsakalotos told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference
on Friday that his country's financing needs are under control.
    Greece, which exited that last of its bailout programmes in
August, has agreed debt relief measures with its euro zone
partners. These extend maturities on some loans and soften the
interest rate burden on others. Athens also has a 24 billion
euro cash buffer, which will help to improve debt sustainability
over the medium term. [nL5N1V71XX]
    Tsakalotos said Athens would return to the bond market at
the optimal time, and played down the Italian bond selloff.
    ""It has made it a little harder but on the other hand I
think markets are now becoming more sophisticated in
understanding that Greece has finished its programme, it has
done a huge amount of reforms, it's got a buffer so that its
financing needs are under control for at least 2-1/2 years,"" he
said. 
    ""Also it has got a debt deal that means financing its debt
is easier than it is in Portugal and Italy.""
    Asked if Greece will attempt a bond sale this year through
syndication -- where banks are appointed to sell debt directly
to investors -- Tsakalotos said he will leave the timing up to
Greece's debt agency chief. 
    ""He has instructions from the government that when markets
are appropriate, we would like to go. But it's his job to do the
research and to tell us when it is the optimal time,"" he said. 
    ""We're comfortable that we can wait since we have the
buffer, but that doesn't mean we won't go when the time is
right, and I think the time will be right over the medium term.""
    Earlier in the year, Athens was believed to be considering a
10-year bond syndication, its first sale in that benchmark
maturity since its debt crisis began in 2010. 
    Since then, Italian debt has sold off as the new
anti-establishment government in Rome set out spending plans
that put it at odds with Brussels. 
    Italy's 10-year bond yields <IT10YT=RR> have nearly doubled
from 1.72 percent in April to 3.31 percent on Monday, dragging
up Greek 10-year yields <GR10YT=RR> from 3.85 percent at the
start of May to 4.25 percent currently. 
    
    ITALIAN TALKS
    Even so, Tsakalotos said the European Commission should be
understanding when negotiating with Rome over its budget plans. 
    ""Italy is a country whose GDP per capita has hardly
increased in the last 20 years and it's also a country with huge
regional inequalities,"" he said. ""So it's important that the
Commission and member states take into account the Italian
situation and try to reach a compromise which would be good for
the people of Italy but also for Europe itself."" 
    Asked if Italy should look at an alternative route, he said
it was important that Italy stays in the European Union. 
    ""I'm a pro-European for a lot of reasons but a major reason
is that I've always feared that if Europe breaks up, it will
result into the kind of nasty right-wing populist politics of
the 1930s with competitive devaluations, rival nationalisms,"" he
said. 
    ""So I think it's important for European people and for a
progressive agenda that we not only avoid that but reform Europe
in a way that addresses the real issues people face in terms of
social inequalities, the amount of jobs available and the
quality of those jobs.""

    By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
    NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against
the euro, on Monday, close to a 10-week high hit last week, on
news German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election
as head of her CDU party.
    More broadly, the dollar added to recent gains against other
major currencies, supported by robust U.S. consumer spending
data on Monday.
    Merkel said she would not seek re-election as party
chairwoman, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has
dominated European politics. [nL8N1X924N][nL8N1X926U]
    ""Currency markets considered her the Iron Lady of Europe,""
said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global
Payments in Toronto.
    ""This is certainly not positive for the euro's political
backing,"" he said.
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit and a budget crisis in Italy, said Schamotta.
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.    
    ""Merkel has been a stabilising force for the euro zone
throughout the last decade,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst
at online forex broker Oanda, said in a note.
    The euro was 0.28 percent lower against the greenback. 
    Schamotta cautioned against reading too much into the euro's
weakness on the day.
    ""I would not suggest that this might have a permanent impact
on the euro area. She is still chancellor and there is every
possibility that she moves on up to an European Council
position,"" he said.
    The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of six major currencies, was up 0.35 percent, just shy of
the 10-week high hit on Friday. The greenback rose 0.57 percent
against the Japanese yen, reclaiming some ground lost last week.
    The dollar has been boosted by growing volatility in capital
markets spurred by concerns about corporate earnings and
geopolitical uncertainty.
    Data showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh
straight month in September. [nL2N1X6143]
    The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again in
December.
    While speculators' trimmed their net long bets on the U.S.
dollar slightly in the latest week, they remain positioned
significantly long the greenback, data on Friday showed.
[nL2N1X61PV]
    The pound inched down to just above two-month lows as
traders prepared for the British finance minister's annual
budget speech. [nL8N1X91X9]

envisaged, the savings may be used to reduce the budget deficit,
a government source said on Monday.
    An early retirement option and a ""citizens' wage"" income
support scheme have been allocated around 17 billion euros in
the budget.
    However, the details of these measures, as well as their
timing, have not yet been fixed, and some of the funds may not
be used if the reforms are not launched until later in year.

Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Fresh from the surprise
announcement of her planned departure yesterday, Germany's
Angela Merkel grapples with what could become a key part of her
legacy today. She has invited African leaders to Berlin to forge
ahead with what has been described a ""Marshall Plan"" for Africa,
intended to boost private investment in the continent and so
pre-empt what her administration sees as the prospect of future
mass African migration into Europe. Rwanda's Paul Kagame, South
Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa and Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed will be among
the attendees. 
    While financial markets worry about Italy's expansive budget
plans, further west along the Mediterranean Portugal's minority
Socialist government is quietly getting its country's finances
in order. Today sees the first reading in parliament of the 2019
budget bill, which is designed to cut the deficit to 0.2 percent
- the lowest in the country's democratic history five years
after it emerged from a debt crisis and bailout. Moreover, it is
managing to do that while giving public-sector workers higher
pay, helping families with transport costs and investing more in
healthcare. The government's left-wing allies in parliament are
expected to support the bill, which will be subject to
amendments before a final vote in November.
    Some slightly underwhelming data on the French economy are
out this morning, with third-quarter growth up at 0.4 percent
but still less than the market consensus, plus consumer spending
falling more heavily than expected in September. That comes
ahead of the first reading for eurozone growth as a whole in the
third quarter this morning, with analysts expecting 0.4 percent
on the quarter for 1.8 percent over the year.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
The speed with which the brief rally in U.S. stocks faded on
Monday gives ample evidence of the new mood on Wall Street, with
the latest twist focussing on the Sino-U.S. trade war and
reports Washington will impose tariffs on all Chinese imports by
the end of the year without progress at next month’s meeting of
Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The S&P 500 ended 0.6
percent lower, its weakest close in almost six months and just
shy of a 10 percent drop from last month’s record closing high.
Ahead of Apple’s third-quarter earnings on Thursday, tech stocks
led the retreat. The Vix volatility gauge probed above 25
percent, although it held below that level first thing on
Tuesday. By contrast, Chinese stocks gained overnight as
regulators promised a slew of market-supporting measures and the
onshore yuan’s guiding fix was set at its lowest level against
the dollar in 10 years. The Shanghai-Shenzhen composite gained
more 1 percent, recouping some of Monday’s heavy losses. Hong
Kong stocks were 0.7 percent in red, however. But a firmer
dollar and earnings reports helped equity benchmarks in Tokyo
and Seoul rise with Shanghai. MSCI’s all-country world index has
eked out as little as a 0.04 percent gain for the day so far,
with MSCI’s emerging-market benchmark in the red after hitting
its lowest level in more than 18 months earlier. 
    With core U.S. inflation readings coming in ahead of
forecast, the equity shakeout has yet to shift expectations of
further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve, and U.S.
Treasury yields and the dollar have pushed higher again more
broadly this week. Apart from another hail of earnings in
Europe, eyes are also on third-quarter GDP readings from across
the euro zone. France has already missed growth estimates, with
a sub-forecast 0.4 percent expansion during the quarter. It also
registered a much bigger-than-expected 1.7 drop in consumer
spending last month. Italy and overall euro zone GDP releases
are due out later. A worrying drop in business sentiment across
Europe in recent months has unnerved equity markets across the
continent as earnings growth comes in at less than half the pace
of U.S. peers, with trade worries exaggerated by political
nerves surrounding Italy’s budget standoff and brinkmanship in
Brexit negotiations. Results from BNP Paribas on Tuesday would
do nothing to quell investors’ concerns about European banks.
Shares in France’s largest-listed bank fell more than 3 percent
at the open after it said weakness at its corporate and
investment banking arm and at European retail banks drove
revenue down – a 5 percent miss against expectations. Reports on
Monday that China was planning to halve auto sales taxes gave
the auto sector some respite on Monday. But the darkening
economic clouds are already raising questions about the European
Central Bank’s plans to start normalizing its monetary policy
over the next 12 months. Flash October inflation readings are
also due out today and a number of prominent ECB speakers are on
the diary. 
    Sterling was weaker against the euro and dollar after
Monday’s UK autumn budget statement loosening fiscal policy
slightly – contingent on a Brexit deal - but the budget maths
left many doubts about over-optimistic economic growth forecasts
for next year. Italian government bonds yields dipped for a
second day in a row on Tuesday ahead of a key auction of
benchmark five and 10-year bonds.

accelerated in the first nine months of 2018, rising 4.9 percent
year-on-year compared with 4.7 percent in the same period of

    Growth in September alone was 5.6 percent year-on-year, up

highest growth in September was registered in the processing
industry, financial sector, trade, transport and real estate

    FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Soured credit, cybercrime and
Brexit are among the biggest risks facing euro zone banks in
2019, the European Central Bank said on Tuesday, as it set out
its supervisory priorities for the year ahead. 
    The euro zone's growth has reduced overall economic
uncertainty, but global risk factors from protectionism to a
hard Brexit and emerging-market turmoil are growing and warrant
closer monitoring, the central bank said. It keeps watch over
118 of the biggest euro zone banks. 
    ""Compared to last year, there has been a substantial
decrease in risks stemming from economic and fiscal conditions
in the euro area, mostly due to a favourable cyclical momentum,""
the ECB said in a regular risk assessment exercise.
    ""At the same time, geopolitical uncertainties and risks of
repricing in financial markets have increased. Advances in
digitalisation exacerbate the risks related to banks’ legacy IT
systems and cyberattacks.""
    Other notable risks include a repricing in financial markets
and the impact of record-low interest rates on bank
profitability, it added.
    With regard to Brexit, the ECB stressed that banks need to
be ready for any outcome, since no agreement has been reached
just months before Britain is due to exit the European Union. 
    ""Banks' preparedness for Brexit remains a high priority for
ECB Banking Supervision,"" the ECB said. ""ECB Banking Supervision
will further prepare to take over the direct supervision of a
number of institutions that are newly identified as significant
owing to the Brexit-induced relocation of activities.""
    It added that it will continue to press banks to reduce
their stock of non-performing loans after notable progress this
year and will also scrutinize lending practices to mitigate
potential risks.
    It will also conduct a targeted review of banks' internal
models for calculating risk to reduce unwarranted deviation from
its own expectation.

populous regions accelerated in October to reach the highest
level in many years, data showed on Tuesday, adding weight to
the European Central Bank's case for gradually winding down its
unprecedented monetary stimulus.
    With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last
week confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying
programme at the end of this year and raise interest rates for
the first time since 2011 sometime after next summer.
[nL8N1X56JH]
    The ECB's goal is to keep inflation in the euro zone close
to, but just below, two percent a year.
    Annual inflation in Germany's most populous state, North
Rhine-Westphalia, picked up to 2.4 percent in October from 2.3
percent in the previous month, preliminary regional statistics
office data showed.
    This was the highest reading since October, 2011.
    In Bavaria, the second-most populous state, and in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the third, annual inflation accelerated to
2.8 percent after 2.5 percent in the previous month.
    The state inflation readings, which are not harmonised to
compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide
data due at 1300 GMT.
    A poll conducted before the release of the regional data
suggested that Germany's harmonised consumer price inflation
(HICP) rate would pick up to 2.4 percent in October from 2.2
percent in the previous month.
    This would be the highest reading since February, 2012.
    The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data for
October on Wednesday, with the headline figure expected to pick
up to 2.2 percent after 2.1 percent in September, according to a
Reuters poll.

    ZAGREB, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Croatia plans to formally notify
Brussels next year about its intention of joining the two-year
waiting room before eventually adopting the euro currency,
central bank governor Boris Vujcic said on Tuesday.
    ""We're preparing a letter of intention on joining the
European Exchange Mechanism (ERM-2) (that) we plan to send (to
Brussels) next year,"" Vujcic told an economic panel.
    The ERM-2 is a tool that serves as a testing ground for the
countries that want to join the euro zone. During at least two
years a candidate country must prove the stability of its
currency against the euro within a determined fluctuation band.
    The Croatian government wants the country to join the ERM-2
in 2020 and to adopt the euro six to seven years from now.
    ""We're aware we must continue working on reducing
macroeconomic imbalances and pursuing structural reforms as a
precondition for joining the euro successfully,"" Vujcic said.
    Brussels already monitors Croatia for excessive public debt
which has been on a downward path in the last three years, from
around 85 percent of gross domestic product to around 75 percent
expected at the end of this year.
    One of the key conditions for joining the euro is that
public debt does not exceed 60 percent of GDP or, if somewhat
above it, clearly falling towards that level.
    The European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis,
who is on a visit to Zagreb, said that Brussels supported
Croatia's efforts, but also insisted on structural reforms that
would prove the economy resilient to potential shocks.
    ""At the moment Croatia's growth potential is not high enough
to converge quickly with more developed European Union
economies,"" he told the economic panel.
    Croatia's economy is currently growing slightly below three
percent annually, but its mid-term growth potential is seen at
between 1-2 percent amid a poor investment climate, a rather
slow and bloated public administration and low employment level
among its active population.

    * Progress on migration could boost Merkel's ally in

 (Recasts with Africa summit)
    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
hosts African leaders on Tuesday in a drive to tackle
underdevelopment on the continent that helped to spur mass
migration, shaping the later years of her long premiership.
    Merkel announced on Monday she would retire from politics by
2021, sending shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to
succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 leaders including South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and
Rwanda's Paul Kagame, is designed to showcase the continent as a
stable destination for German investment.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which along with political instability and violence has
encouraged large numbers to head for Europe.
    ""We have to make sure we don't stay in aid mode,"" Merkel's
Africa coordinator Guenter Nooke told public radio. ""The many
millions of jobs we need in Africa can't be created with public
money.""
    If Merkel is to ensure the leadership of her Christian
Democrat party passes to a centrist ally, such as current
general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, she needs to show
that she has made progress in fixing the conditions that led to
her fateful decision three years ago.
    Other candidates, including Health Minister Jens Spahn or
her old rival, the strongly pro-business Friedrich Merz, are
well to her right politically and could be expected to want to
challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to
refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as
Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of
the human tide.
    The crisis upturned European politics, revitalising the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    But officials around the chancellor believe that migration
can only be slowed sustainably by removing the ""push"" factors of
unemployment and instability in Africa, something that will only
be exacerbated by climate change.
    Officials hope that the summit, attended also by Christine
Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
will encourage more companies to invest on the continent,
creating jobs that aid has failed to do. 
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

 (adds economists, ECB, French and German data)
    By Francesco Guarascio and Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew less
than expected in the third quarter as the public mood turned
darker, with signs of distress in Italy highlighting concerns
that the bloc's third-ranked state is becoming one of its
weakest links.
    Tuesday's data, suggesting the slowdown has further to run,
will make uncomfortable reading for the European Central Bank as
it moves towards ending in December the programme of asset
purchases it introduced in 2015 to boost inflation and economic
growth.
    Economists said the quarterly growth dip to 0.2 percent from
0.4 percent in the second quarter was unlikely to change those
plans, though it might push back the date of the ECB's first
post-stimulus hike in interest rates.
    ""We expect the ECB to stick to its plans to end asset
purchases this year, but the recent run of weak data suggests
that the bank will stress that policy tightening will depend on
the incoming figures,"" Jessica Hinds, economist at Capital
Economics, said.
    Tuesday's preliminary flash GDP reading from European
statistics office Eurostat, which sent the euro <EUR=> to an
intraday low against the dollar, was worse than expected.
    Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent rise
in the 19 countries sharing the euro. The 0.2 percent reported
was the lowest growth pace in more than four years.
    Eurostat does not provide national data in its flash
estimates, but figures from Italy's statistics agency ISTAT
showed growth there stagnated in the third quarter, as the
government pursues a war of words with Brussels over a 2019
budget draft that breaks EU rules. [nR1N1W500K]
    ""With budget discussions already tense between Rome and
Brussels, this stagnation will only add to concerns,"" Bert
Colijn, economist at ING, said.
    Quarterly growth in France, the bloc's second biggest
economy, also missed forecasts at 0.4 percent though growth
accelerated, data from the INSEE statistics agency showed on
Tuesday [nL8N1XA22F].
    An estimate for Germany, the bloc's largest economy, is not
yet available but economists foresee growth is likely to have
slowed there too, although the country's jobless total fell in
October and employment hit a record high in
September[nL8N1XA2UI].
    Meanwhile, inflation in Germany's most populous regions
accelerated in October to well above 2 percent, reaching the
highest level in many years.
    That compares with an ECB target of close to but below 2
percent, though Tuesday's German data was not harmonised to
compare with other euro zone countries and did not strip out
volatile elements such as oil prices, which have risen sharply
in recent months. [nL8N1XA2FO]
    That suggests price pressures will not be a major factor in
shifting ECB decisions at this stage. 
        
    CONFIDENCE ON THE SLIDE
    Of more concern to policymakers in Frankfurt will be
indications that the bloc's economic slowdown could worsen in
the final quarter.
    The European Commission said on Tuesday that euro zone
economic sentiment dropped in October for the tenth consecutive
month. 
    The indicator of managers' and consumers' morale - which
rose steadily in 2017 - fell to 109.8 points from 110.9 in
September, its biggest dip since March though still above its
long-term average.
    In October the largest fall was recorded in retail services
as managers held ""much grimmer views on the present and expected
business situation,"" the Commission said, and the indicator of
selling price expectations dropped.
    Confidence in industry and services also went down, while
consumer sentiment improved slightly.
    Morale fell in Germany, France and Italy while it grew in
Spain.
    In Italy the downward trend began in July, the month after a
eurosceptic government took office in Rome.
    Outside the euro zone, Britain recorded a slight increase of
economic sentiment, driven up by more optimism in retail trade
and services which more than offset a fall in industry
confidence.

percent to 7.2 billion euros, the finance ministry said on

 (Adds Merkel's opening remarks)
    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
hosted African leaders on Tuesday, pledging a new development
fund to tackle underdevelopment on the continent that has helped
to spur mass migration, shaping the later years of her long
premiership.
    Merkel announced on Monday she would retire from politics by
2021, sending shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to
succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 leaders including South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and
Rwanda's Paul Kagame, is designed to showcase the continent as a
stable destination for German investment.
    The International Monetary Fund's Managing Director
Christine Lagarde is also there, along with a host of
international development officials.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which along with political instability and violence has
encouraged large numbers to head for Europe.
    ""We Europeans have a great interest in African states having
a bright economic outlook,"" Merkel said in her opening speech,
announcing a fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises
from both Europe and Africa to invest on the continent.
    Germany has already introduced tax incentives for its
companies to set up plants in Africa, reflecting Merkel's view
that state aid must give way to private investment if jobs are
to be created in their millions.
    If Merkel is to ensure the leadership of her Christian
Democrat party passes to a centrist ally, such as current
general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, she needs to show
that she has made progress in fixing the conditions that led to
her fateful decision three years ago.
    Other candidates, including Health Minister Jens Spahn or
her old rival, the strongly pro-business Friedrich Merz, are
well to her right politically and could be expected to want to
challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to
refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as
Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of
the human tide.
    The crisis upturned European politics, revitalising the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    But officials around the chancellor believe that migration
can only be slowed sustainably by removing the ""push"" factors of
unemployment and instability in Africa, something that will only
be exacerbated by climate change.
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German annual inflation picked up
in October to reach its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years,
data showed on Tuesday, supporting European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi's case for gradually winding down his
unprecedented monetary stimulus.
    German consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable
with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by
2.4 percent year-on-year after an increase of 2.2 percent in the
previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
    That was the highest reading since February 2012 and in line
with market expectations. The ECB targets inflation of close to
but below 2 percent for the single-currency bloc as a whole.
    On a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation even hit
a 10-year high at 2.5 percent, the data showed.
    Price pressures picked up on a broad basis, suggesting that
the rise was also driven by core inflation and not only by the
more volatile energy and food components. Germany's preliminary
inflation data do not include a figure for core inflation.
[nAPN009200]
    With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last
week confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96
trillion) bond-buying programme at the end of this year and
raise interest rates for the first time since 2011 sometime
after next summer.
    The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data for
October on Wednesday, with the headline figure expected to pick
up to 2.2 percent after 2.1 percent in September.
    The inflation figures chimed with data released earlier on
Tuesday that showed Germany's jobless total fell in October and
employment hit a record high in September, underlining the
strength of a labour market that is supporting a consumer-led
upswing in Europe's largest economy. [nL8N1XA2UI]

    BEIRUT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Lebanon's risk profile is rising
sharply and some of the central bank's tools are becoming less
effective, the World Bank said on Tuesday in its autumn Lebanon
Economic Monitor report. 
    In response, the central bank has beefed up its foreign
exchange reserves, lengthened the maturity of deposits and
limited available liquidity, the report said. 
    Almost six months since a parliamentary election in May,
Lebanon's politicians are yet to agree a unity government that
can get to work on badly needed economic reforms. Politicians
have warned of economic crisis unless a government is formed
soon. 
    The country has the world's third largest public debt-to-GDP
ratio, stagnant growth and what the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has said are increasing vulnerabilities in its financial
system.
    Reforms are needed to bring down twin deficits and reduce
reliance on central bank operations which the IMF has described
as unconventional. 
    ""Fiscal and electricity reforms are highlighted as
priorities,"" the report said. 
    The formation of a new government and a programme of reforms
would also likely unlock more than $11 billion worth of
infrastructure investment pledged at a donors' meeting in Paris
in April.

 (Adds Egypt's Sisi, statistics on European investment in
Africa)
    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
pledged on Tuesday a new development fund to tackle unemployment
in Africa, a problem spurring the mass migration that has shaped
her long premiership as it nears its end.
    Merkel hosted a summit of African leaders a day after
announcing she would retire from politics by 2021, sending
shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 presidents and prime
ministers including Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, South Africa's
Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Rwanda's Paul Kagame,
is designed to showcase the continent as a stable destination
for German investment.
    International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine
Lagarde is also there, along with a host of international
development officials.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which, along with political instability and violence,
has encouraged large numbers to head for Europe. But with
Africa's population growing at almost three percent a year, the
task is enormous.
    ""We Europeans have a great interest in African states having
a bright economic outlook,"" Merkel said in her opening speech,
announcing the fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises
from both Europe and Africa to invest on the continent.
    The 119,000 Africans who arrived in Europe in 2018,
according to the International Organisation for Migration, are
the tip of the iceberg. International Labour Organisation
figures show that 16 million migrants were on the move within
Africa in 2014. 
    While European Union countries invested $22 billion in
Africa in 2017, breakneck economic growth will be needed to help
bring down the migrant numbers. 
    Berlin hopes Germany's manufacturing-based economy, which
drove Eastern Europe's rapid economic growth after the 1989
collapse of Communism, could turn things round.
    Merkel needs results fast if she is to ensure the leadership
of her Christian Democrats passes to a centrist ally, such as
current general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, although
she has declined to back anyone openly.
    
    A MARSHALL PLAN FOR AFRICA?
    Other candidates for the party leadership, including Health
Minister Jens Spahn or her old rival, the strongly pro-business
Friedrich Merz, are well to her right politically and could be
expected to want to challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel has said she will remain chancellor but that her
current, fourth term up to 2021 will be her last.   
    Germany has introduced tax incentives for its companies to
set up plants in Africa, reflecting her view that state aid must
give way to private investment if jobs are to be created in
their millions. 
    This would be part of a ""Marshall Plan for Africa"" - named
after the U.S.-funded plan that helped to rebuild European
states including Germany after World War Two - that she sees as
central to her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to
refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as
Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of
the human tide.
    The crisis upturned European politics, revitalising the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds were hit
on Tuesday by data showing the country's economy flatlined in
the third quarter of the year, while a 5.5 billion euro auction
pushed yields even higher.
    Italy's economy ground to a halt in the third quarter, data
showed on Tuesday, as both domestic demand and trade flows
failed to spur any growth, while euro zone growth disappointed
for the same period. [nR1N1W500K] [nL8N1XA2WV]
    Yields on Italian government bonds were eight to 14 basis
points higher on the day.
    ""It's a surprisingly weak Italian GDP number, it kind of
puts an end to the expectations that the government has that
they can base their budget on their current growth projections,""
said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder. 
    ""It highlights how out of touch some of the assumptions of
the Italian government were on this backdrop.""             
    Italy's government assumes economic growth of 1.5 percent in
2019, higher than the 1.1 percent growth projected by the
European Commission. 
    Those economic projections are the base for Rome's plans to
increase the budget deficit next year. Last week, the European
Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget because it broke
EU rules. [nB5N1SU00Y] 
    Italy's 10-year bond yield was last up 14 bps at 3.47
percent <IT10YT=RR>, above Monday's almost one-month low of 3.27
percent hit on relief that Standard & Poor's did not downgrade
Italy's credit rating after a review on Friday.[nL8N1X92J0]
    The spread over yields on German debt was at 309 bps
<DE10YT=RR>, having narrowed on Monday to around 287 bps.
    Fresh supply added to the upward pressure on Italian yields.
    Italy's Treasury raised the top planned amount of 5.5
billion euros ($6.2 billion) over three bonds. [nS8N1T906W]
    While weak Italian economic growth data hurt Italian bonds, 
softer-than-expected euro zone GDP data and the selloff in
Italian debt leant some support to higher rated bond markets.
    In Germany, the euro zone's benchmark bond issuer, 10-year
bonds yields were down about a basis point at 0.37 percent. 
    Data showed the euro zone economy grew 1.7 percent in the
third quarter compared with 2.2 percent expansion in the
previous quarter, adding to a view that an unwind from the
European Central Bank's ultra-easy monetary policy will be slow.
    ""Softer growth will likely trigger a debate at the ECB
whether the guarantee to keep interest rates at their current
record-low levels should be extended beyond the summer of 2019,""
said Berenberg economist Florian Hense said in a note.
    For now, the GDP data also offset strong German inflation
data. German annual inflation picked up in October to 2.4
percent -- reaching its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years.

    BEIRUT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Lebanon's risk profile is rising
sharply and some of its central bank tools are becoming less
effective, the World Bank said on Tuesday in its autumn Lebanon
Economic Monitor report. 
    The central bank has in response beefed up its foreign
exchange reserves, lengthened the maturity of deposits and
limited available liquidity, the report said. 
    Almost six months since a parliamentary election, Lebanon's
politicians are yet to agree a unity government that must get to
work on badly needed economic reforms. Politicians have warned
of economic crisis unless a government is formed soon. 
    The country has the world's third largest public debt-to-GDP
ratio, stagnant growth and what the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has said are increasing vulnerabilities in its financial
system.
    Reforms are needed to bring down twin deficits and reduce
reliance on central bank operations which the IMF has described
as unconventional. 
    Debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to continue rising ""in an
unsustainable path"" toward 155 percent by the end of 2018, the
World Bank report said.    
    ""The risk profile for Lebanon is rising sharply in light of
the convergence of a number of negative local and global
factors, including global monetary conditions,"" it said. 
""Fiscal and electricity reforms are highlighted as priorities."" 
   
    The World Bank said it has revised its projection for 2018
real GDP growth downwards to 1 percent from 2 percent. The halt
in central bank subsidized lending is having a significant
impact on the real economy, it said. 
    The formation of a new government and a programme of reforms
would also likely unlock more than $11 billion worth of
infrastructure investment pledged at a donors' meeting in Paris
in April.
    The World Bank report said it saw potential for Lebanon to
""regain the confidence of its people and investors"" after the
parliamentary election in May. It also noted Lebanon would
likely benefit from the reopening of an important border
crossing between neighbours Syria and Jordan this month.    
    Still, hope of a quick government formation and the positive
boost from the Paris donor conference have waned after weeks of
political wrangling, the report said. 
    Attracting enough capital, especially deposits, has been
challenging in light of slower deposit growth. ""There is a
near-complete void of government initiative to address
macroeconomic imbalances,"" the report said. 
    Instead, central bank interventions, even when they succeed,
""offer only temporary reprieve"" and can have macro-financial
risks, it added.

    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
pledged on Tuesday a new development fund to tackle unemployment
in Africa, a problem spurring the mass migration that has shaped
her long premiership as it nears its end.
    Merkel hosted a summit of African leaders a day after her
announcement that she would retire from politics by 2021, which
sent shockwaves across Europe and started a race to succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million asylum seekers.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 presidents and prime
ministers including Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, South Africa's
Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Rwanda's Paul Kagame,
is designed to showcase the continent as a stable destination
for German investment.
    International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine
Lagarde is also there, along with a host of international
development officials.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which, along with political instability and violence,
has encouraged large numbers to head for Europe. But with
Africa's population growing at almost three percent a year, the
task is enormous.
    ""We Europeans have a great interest in African states having
a bright economic outlook,"" Merkel said in her opening speech,
announcing the fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises
from both Europe and Africa to invest on the continent.
    The 119,000 Africans who arrived in Europe in 2018,
according to the International Organisation for Migration, are
the tip of the iceberg. International Labour Organisation
figures show that 16 million migrants were on the move within
Africa in 2014.
    While European Union countries invested $22 billion in
Africa in 2017, breakneck economic growth will be needed to help
bring down the migrant numbers. 
    Berlin hopes Germany's manufacturing-based economy, which
drove Eastern Europe's rapid economic growth after the 1989
collapse of Communism, could turn things round.
    Merkel needs results fast if she is to ensure the leadership
of her Christian Democrats passes to a centrist ally, such as
its general secretary, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
    
    A MARSHALL PLAN FOR AFRICA?
    Other candidates for the party leadership, including Health
Minister Jens Spahn or her old rival, the strongly pro-business
Friedrich Merz, are well to her right politically and could be
expected to want to challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel has said she will remain chancellor but that her
current, fourth term up to 2021 will be her last. A whopping 71
percent of Germans welcomed Merkel's decision, a poll released
Tuesday by broadcasters RTL and n-tv showed.  
    Germany has introduced tax incentives for its companies to
set up plants in Africa, reflecting her view that state aid must
give way to private investment if jobs are to be created in
their millions. 
    This would be part of a ""Marshall Plan for Africa"" - named
after the U.S.-funded plan that helped to rebuild European
states including Germany after World War Two - that she sees as
central to her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders in
2015 as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of the
human tide, that year mostly fleeing the civil war in Syria.
    An agreement with Turkey sharply curtailed the arrival of
refugees into the EU through Greece. But hundreds of thousands
of mainly African migrants continued to travel across the
Mediterranean, a flow that finally began to abate in the past
year with improved efforts to halt smuggling from Libya. 
    The crisis has upturned European politics, bringing the far
right to power in Italy and Austria, and in Germany revitalising
the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European Commission has said
Italy's large public debt is a source of ""concern for the euro
area as a whole"" and has asked the government to address worries
about its big-spending 2019 budget by Nov. 13.
    ""Italy's public debt remains a key vulnerability,"" the
Commission wrote in a letter dated Oct. 29, which was released
by the Italian Treasury on Tuesday. The Treasury said it would
respond by the middle of next month, as requested.
    Italy is locked in a tussle with the EU executive, which
earlier this month rejected the government's expansionary budget
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks.
    The ruling coalition has so far ruled this out.
    The budget targets a deficit next year of 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product, up from a targeted 1.8 percent this
year, flouting an EU requirement that the deficit should fall
steadily towards a balanced budget.
    The government has forecast that Italy's debt/GDP ratio will
fall next year to 130.0 percent from a projected 130.9 percent
this year, but the Commission said this was not enough.
    ""Such high public debt constrains the government's room for
manoeuvre (to allow) more productive investment for the benefit
of its citizens,"" it added.
