0,6,195524aefd650b980097488f768351fb,UPDATE 2-ECB's Coeure expects another year of interest rate stability -Tagesspiegel,2018-10-01 0:52:07,EUR,-1.7833599999999998,2018-10-01 0:52:12,{'EUR': 'Neutral'}," (Adds comments on euro zone economy, reforms, financial system)
    BERLIN, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank (ECB)
expects interest rates to stay at their current level through
the summer of next year and the scaling back of economic
stimulus measures to be gradual, board member Benoit Coeure told
Germany's Taggespiegel.
    The comments are in line with the bank's previous assertion
that it is comfortable with market expectations for an interest
rate rise in the final quarter of 2019.
    ""We expect interest rates to stay at the current level at
least through the summer of 2019. But we have already started to
reduce our net asset purchases and anticipate them ending after
the end of December,"" Coeure told the newspaper in an interview
released on Sunday ahead of publication on Monday.
    With inflation picking up, the ECB has been curbing stimulus
for months and plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase
scheme in December. 
    Coeure said that ample monetary stimulus would still be
needed to achieve the bank's euro zone inflation target of
below, but close to, 2 percent. 
    ""Price pressures are gradually picking up. But this doesn’t
happen in one day,"" Coeure said, adding that the euro zone
economy was proving very robust.
    But for all its resilience, Coeure said that trade disputes
and declining support for the multilateral order make
strengthening Europe an urgent task.
    Responsible fiscal policies and economic reforms at national
level, completion of the banking union and capital market union
are needed, he said.
    Asked about Brexit, Coeure said that the ECB has to be
prepared for all eventualities. 
    ""Likewise, the financial sector should prepare for the
worst: a no-deal Brexit,"" he said, adding that he hopes the EU
and Britain can reach a deal that allows an orderly Brexit.
    Coeure also said that, while the financial system is far
safer than when the global financial crisis struck 10 years ago,
more work has to be done.
    He warned against complacency and said the next crisis might
not come from the financial system. 
    ""At the ECB, we are currently looking closely at
cybersecurity ...  We don't want the next crisis to be triggered
by a hacker,"" he said.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - British finance
minister Philip Hammond will look to reassure businesses that
they remain at the heart of the centre-right Conservatives' plan
for the economy, against a backdrop of heightened tension over
Brexit.  
    Britain's exit from the European Union next March has
increased uncertainty for employers, with talks about the future
relationship between the world's fifth largest economy and it
largest trading partner becoming increasingly fraught.
    Hammond will seek to repair relations with a business
community which has expressed frustration over the government's
lack of clarity during the Brexit process and what some see as a
decision to put ideology before the economy.  
    ""We back business, as the cornerstone of a successful
economy; as a force for good in our society; and as an essential
expression of our values,” Hammond will say in his speech to the
Conservative Party's annual conference in Birmingham.
    Ahead of the conference, the British Chambers of Commerce
said it wanted the Conservatives to overcome their internal
divisions and ""to deliver real-world, practical answers to
business’s ongoing questions around Brexit – and avoid a messy
and disorderly exit from the EU.""
    Relations suffered earlier this year when then-foreign
minister Boris Johnson was quoted dismissing business leaders'
concerns about Brexit, using foul language in a meeting with EU
diplomats.
    The government has since adopted a more business friendly
negotiating strategy, but is struggling to win support from both
Brussels and May's own Conservative Party, raising fears talks
may end without a deal and disrupt firms' supply chains.
    Last week, Britain's opposition Labour Party sought to woo
business bosses even as it unveiled a raft of radical economic
policies, saying that the Conservatives had given them the
opportunity to pitch an alternative leftist strategy.
[nL8N1WB31F] 
    Hammond will seek to address what the government has
identified as one of the root causes of 2016's surprise vote to
leave the EU and a poor showing at a 2017 national election: a
failure to share the benefits of the modern capitalist economy
more evenly.
    ""Too many people have experienced years of slow wage growth,
felt less secure in their jobs and seen the housing market
spiral beyond their reach,"" he will say.
    ""So the challenge is to ensure that 21st Century capitalism
delivers for them; to convince them that our vision of Britain’s
future can meet their aspirations and that our plan, unlike
Labour’s, will actually deliver a better tomorrow for them and
their families.""
    He will announce investment into training in core subject
like science and maths and a series of initiatives to improve
productivity within Britain's small and medium-sized businesses.

    By Hideyuki Sano
    TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar and the Mexican
peso rose on Monday on hopes of progress in negotiations over a
renewed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal, but
Asian shares got off to a slow start amid further signs of
weakness in China.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> dipped 0.1 percent in early trade, led by fall
in Australia, though activity is likely to be slow due to
holidays in China including Hong Kong.
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> gained 0.25 percent though the Topix
<.TOPX>, broader and better gauge of the market, was down 0.2
percent.
    Casting a shadow in Asia, two surveys showed on Sunday that
growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September as
domestic and export demand softened. [nL4N1WG01M]. 
    The private Caixin/Markit factory Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI) fell to 50.0, the lowest reading since May 2017, in a
stark reminder that the trade disputes are starting to have real
consequences on the economy.
    ""The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China
recently has likely weighed on purchasing managers' sentiment as
reflected by softer readings in trade-related sub-indices,""
wrote economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
    ""Deterioration of PMI in September is in line with our
expectation that coincident growth indicators will get worse
before getting better. As U.S.-China trade conflict intensifies,
we expect China's policymakers to step up monetary and fiscal
easing to soften the blow from higher tariffs,"" they added.
    The world's share markets had rallied in September on hopes
that China and the United States will eventually work out a deal
on trade, but talks proposed for around the end of the month
collapsed after the two sides launched more tit-for-tat tariffs.
    MSCI's broadest gauge of the world's shares covering 47
markets <.MIWD00000PUS> rose for the third straight month in
September. 
    In the currency market, the Canadian dollar rose about 0.5
percent to a four-month high of C$1.2838 to the U.S. dollar
<CAD=D4>.
    Canadian and U.S. negotiators ""made lots of progress"" on
Sunday on a renewed NAFTA, but had still not settled tough
issues such as American tariffs and access to Canada's dairy
market, an official and sources said. [nL2N1WG084]
    U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has said Canada
must sign on to the text of the updated North American Free
Trade Agreement by midnight on Sunday (0400 GMT Monday) or face
exclusion from the pact. 
    Canadian media said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will hold
a cabinet meeting at 0200 GMT.
    The yen <JPY=> softened to 113.85 per dollar, its lowest
since mid-November last year.
    On the other hand, the euro was hit by worries about rise in
Italy's fiscal deficit after the Italian government agreed to
set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put
Rome on a collision course with Brussels. [nL8N1WE1PY]
    The common currency traded at $1.1608 <EUR=>, having lost
1.2 percent last week and off three-month high of $1.18155
touched a week ago.
    Oil prices stayed near recent peaks, with international
benchmark Brent trading near a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions
on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even
as other key exporters increased production.
    Brent crude futures <LCOc1> rose 0.4 percent to as high as
$83.07 per barrel, the strongest level since November 2014.

    TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar and the Mexican
peso rose and Japanese shares hit 27-year highs on Monday after
the United States and Canada reached a framework deal to update
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
    A Canadian source confirmed the two countries reached a
deal, with Canada agreeing to a side-letter arrangement
effectively capping automobile exports to the United States.
[nL2N1WG080]
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose as much as 0.8 percent to climb
a tad above the 27-year high reached on Friday, and it ended the
morning session 0.6 percent ahead.
    U.S. stock futures <ESc1> also gained 0.5 percent.
    Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, said NAFTA is the second largest
trade issue Washington has, after China.
    ""Investors will likely view the latest agreement positively,
a sign that trade disputes are easing outside China-U.S. talks,""
he said.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> was softer, falling 0.15 percent. Regional
volumes are likely to be light, due to holidays in China

    In Japan, the Bank of Japan's tankan survey showed business
confidence among Japan's big manufacturers has worsened in the
September for three quarters in a row - for the first time since
2008-2009.
    The world's share markets had rallied in September on hopes
that China and the United States will eventually work out a deal

    ON THE RADAR: M&A AND IPOS AND NO NAFTA EXUBERANCE (0651 GMT) 
    European futures are pointing to an only slightly positive open. Nothing extravagant as
investors take the view that the U.S. trade war dispute with China is far from over.
    Poor macro data from China is also likely to weigh on miners and basic materials, meaning
that the FTSE could actually lose some ground at the open. 
    Among potential movers is France's supermarket retailer Casino, one of the most shorted
stock on the French market, selling property assets for 565 millions euros in a bid to reduce
debt and answers critics such as Muddy Waters. 
    More M&A with Veolia selling a 30 percent stake in Transdev to Germany’s Rethmann, Avocet
Mining hinting a breakup and Mitie’s deal to sell its pest control business to Rentokil. 
    Good news for UK retail with Aldi UK reporting its first profit rise in four years.
                                   
    Plenty of governance news with Germany's Thyssenkrupp ending its leadership vacuum, Fiat
Chrysler unveiling a new management structure, and Just Group CFO Simon Thomas stepping down.
    Also positive news showing equity capital market activity is alive and kicking in Europe:
Denmark's Abacus Medicine says it plans IPO in Frankfurt and Aston Martin saying it has covered
its books.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES MAKE CAUTIOUS START (0609 GMT) 
    European futures have made a cautious start this morning with the Nafta deal prompting
measured optimism rather than irrational exuberance among investors. 
    The FTSE is currently lagging its European peers with miners, index heavyweights, expected
to suffer from poor data in China. 
    Here's what it looks like at the moment:

    NAFTA WHITE SMOKE SEEN LIFTING EUROPE AT THE OPEN (0525 GMT)
    There seems to be white smoke coming out of the Nafta negotiations with a Canadian source
confirming a deal, prompting a jump in the Canadian currency. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 43 points higher and Paris' CAC to
rise 21 points on trade war relief.   
    Things are not looking so good for London's FTSE which is seen opening 4 points lower. 
    ""The FTSE is pointing to a lower start to trading on the opening bell, with miners expected
to weigh heavily"", wrote Jasper Lawler, head of research London Capital Group as two surveys
showed on Sunday that growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September.
    ""Metals across the board traded lower overnight following yet another round of disappointing
data from China"", he added.

    Growth in manufacturing activity has dwindled across the euro currency bloc this year and the latest data suggests the momentum in the currency bloc is well past its peak.
    IHS Markit's September final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a two-year low of 53.2 from August's 54.6, a touch below a flash reading of 53.3 and still above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
    An output index, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and is regarded as a good gauge of economic health, fell to a more than two-year low of 52.7 from 54.7 in August.
    Manufacturers are increasingly concerned about barriers to global trade, which was clear with the readings of forward-looking survey indicators. Indeed, the new export orders index fell to a more than five-year low of 50.2 from 52.0.
    With neither Beijing nor Washington ready to compromise and the latest tariffs on each other's goods already imposed, that conflict is a worrying backdrop to an already-weakening factory expansion in Europe.
    ""Euro zone manufacturing shifted down yet another gear at the end of the third quarter. The sector has seen booming growth at the start of the year rapidly fade to the worst performance for two years in September as production and jobs growth have slowed in response to a stalling of export trade,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
    ""The survey paints the worst trade picture for over five years, with export growth having slumped sharply from a series record high in late 2017 to near-stagnation in September.""
    Hiring rates were at a 19-month low and future output index - which measures optimism about the year ahead - fell to a near three-year low. New orders growth slowed further to a 25-month low, suggesting a lack of momentum into the fourth quarter.
    Factories increased prices at a faster pace in September.    Official data showed a flash reading of inflation in the bloc dipped unexpectedly this month, which is likely to increase concern at European Central Bank (ECB) as it slowly withdraws stimulus. [nL8N1WE28S]

    The IHS Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 from an upwardly revised 53.0 in August, topping all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 52.5.
    Export order books recovered slightly from the first decline in more than two years during August, while output expanded at the fastest pace in four months. 
    Still, survey compiler IHS Markit said the latest reading was consistent with the official measure of manufacturing output expanding only moderately.
    Britain's economy has relied heavily on spending by consumers to soften the slowdown that followed the decision by voters in 2016 to leave the European Union.
    Official data on Friday showed Britain's manufacturing sector failed to contribute to economic growth during the first half of 2018.
    ""Despite (some) causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall,"" Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said.
    ""Many UK manufacturers also noted that the backdrop of Brexit and a volatile exchange rate were making any forecasting activity increasingly difficult, with uncertainty and adding to reluctance to hire.""
    Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 but London and Brussels remain deadlocked over the terms of their separation, meaning there remains some chance of a potentially damaging ""no deal"" Brexit.

positive vein. 
    Worries on Italian politics and Chinese manufacturing 
tempered the optimism, but the last-gasp deal to save NAFTA was
enough to put world stocks in the black. 
    The United States and Canada salvaged NAFTA as a trilateral
pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that
had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century
[nL2N1WG084].
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.5 percent to a 27-year high
and European stocks were up overall despite losses on Italian
markets on political concerns. 
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> was up 0.65 percent against the
dollar to a four-month high and the Mexican peso <MXN=> hit its
highest in over seven weeks. 
    ""The trade deal is helping risk appetite across the board,
especially the Canadian dollar, and that will likely lift
appetite for emerging-market currencies across the board,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in
London.    
    A pan-European index of shares <.STOXX> was up 0.25 percent,
though gains were curbed by concern over how the Italian
government's spending plans would affect relations with the
European Union. 
    Italian bond yields extended last week's rise and stocks
fell on a report that the EU is set to reject Italy's budget
plans in November and open a procedure against the country's
public accounts [nR1N1VZ00C].
    The closely watched spread between Italian and German
10-year bond yields was at 270 basis points, over 30 bps wider
than this time last week. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR> 
    ""It is quite clear that the European Commission will not
like (the budget proposal),"" said Commerzbank rates strategist
Michael Leister. ""Brussels will give its opinion, which we think
won’t be positive and ... the ratings agencies will opt for a
similar stance. A downgrade is our base case.""  
    The euro was also hit by worries about a rise in Italy's
fiscal deficit, dropping below the $1.16 mark <EUR=> having lost
1.2 percent last week and off three-month high of $1.18155
touched a week ago.  
    Also casting a shadow were two surveys on Sunday that showed
growth in Chinese manufacturing sputtered in September as
domestic and export demand softened [nL4N1WG01M].
    As a result, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.25 percent. China's
financial markets were closed for a holiday, as was Hong Kong's
stock exchange. 
    ""The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China
recently has likely weighed on purchasing managers' sentiment as
reflected by softer readings in trade-related sub-indices,""
economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.
    Oil prices held their gains, with international benchmark
Brent briefly hitting a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on
Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as
other key exporters increased production.
    Brent crude futures <LCOc1> rose 0.6 percent to as high as
$83.25 per barrel, the highest since November 2014, before
trading flat on the day at $82.72.

    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The share of China's currency held
by central banks rose to nearly 2 percent of global reserves,
according to a quarterly report by the International Monetary
Fund.
    In a report released on Friday, the IMF noted the share of
the Chinese renminbi <CNY=CFXS> is now at levels equivalent to
the Australian dollar <AUD=D3> and the Canadian dollar <CAD=D3>
in central bank portfolios.
     The increase in the holdings in the second quarter came as
trade tensions between the United States and China escalated and
drove the renminbi down more than 5 percent.
    The increase indicated that global reserve managers had a
strong appetite for the Chinese currency, said Steve Englander,
head of global G10 FX strategy at Standard Chartered Bank.
    ""It is also possible that reserve managers were diversifying
out of the dollar, either for portfolio reasons or because of
political differences with the United States,"" Englander said.  
    
    Central banks' reserves are the biggest players in the $5.1
trillion-a-day currency markets. Their portfolio allocations and
changes can have a major impact on a currency over months and
even years.
    By the end of June, central banks had amassed $11 trillion
in global reserves of which they had allocated $10.5 trillion.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> remained the top holding for global
central banks with a market share of 62.2 percent, followed by
the euro currency <EUR=> at 20 percent and the yen at 5 percent.
    The Chinese currency's rise underscores the desire of 
reserve managers to diversify away from their large dollar
holdings.
    The IMF admitted the Chinese currency to the Special Drawing
Rights basket alongside the dollar, euro, pound sterling and yen
in November 2015, and its share has rapidly increased among
global reserve managers.
    By the end of June, the Chinese currency had amassed a
market share of 1.8 percent, overtaking the Australian dollar at
1.7 percent and nearly catching up with the Canadian dollar at
1.9 percent.    
    In dollar terms, the share of the Chinese currency remained
tiny compared with the dollar, euro or yen, IMF data showed.
    In percentage terms, the share of the British currency among
global portfolios declined by 20 basis points to 4.48 percent.

    By Peter Thal Larsen
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Andrea Orcel’s
departure from UBS will test its Goldilocks investment bank.
Like the girl in the fairy tale, the Swiss lender wants a
capital markets arm that is just right: not too big to weigh on
its valuation, but not so small that it cannot compete. Now the
unit’s Italian head is leaving to be CEO of Banco Santander
<SAN.MC>, his replacements have to maintain the balancing act.
    It’s six years since UBS <UBSG.S> Chief Executive Sergio
Ermotti cut the investment bank’s fixed income operations. The
decision has cost market share: UBS ranked ninth in global
investment banking revenue in the first half of 2018, according
to Coalition data.
    However, the switch has helped boost returns. The investment
bank’s first-half operating profit was 1.2 billion Swiss francs
– almost double the same period of 2012, before the change of
strategy. It achieved this with tangible equity of 10.4 billion
Swiss francs – less than half what it consumed six years ago.
    That picture is excessively flattering, as UBS has 19
billion Swiss francs of tangible equity – more than 40 percent
of the total – which is not allocated to its various divisions.
Even allowing for this, though, the business is more profitable.
    A smaller investment bank is also less of a valuation drag.
UBS shares are currently worth about 1.3 times its tangible book
value, well ahead of rivals such as Credit Suisse <CSGN.S> and
Barclays <BARC.L>. That’s a reflection of the value investors
attach to its flagship private banking unit.
    Some investors want UBS to further scale back investment
banking, currently just under a third of risk-weighted assets.
The Swiss lender argues its private bank needs the division to
execute complex trades and provide a stream of new investments.
UBS also benefits by offering corporate finance services to
wealthy clients – and vice versa. If the investment bank shrinks
too far, it will no longer be competitive.
    The question is how much Orcel powered UBS’s recent
performance. The demanding dealmaker boasted several of Europe’s
largest companies as clients, and pushed his subordinates hard.
His successors – corporate financier Piero Novelli and equity
trading chief Robert Karofsky – have to show they can continue
to get the recipe just right. If not, bears will chase them
away.

    By Rahul Karunakar and Leika Kihara
    BENGALURU/TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Growth in factory
activity slowed across Europe and Asia in September, with export
orders weakening before the latest escalation in the U.S.-China
trade conflict, in another sign the global economy is shifting
into lower gear.
    Business surveys released on Sunday and Monday showed the
pace of expansion slowing across European and Asian factories.
Gauges of future activity offered little hope for a turnaround
in the next few months.
    Some of the gloom will be offset by news that the United
States and Canada clinched a deal on Sunday to salvage the North
American Free Trade Agreement, removing one near-term risk to
the global outlook [nL2N1WG084].
    But with neither Beijing nor Washington ready to compromise
and the latest tariffs on each other's goods already imposed,
that conflict is a worrying backdrop to a weakening factory
expansion in Europe and Asia.
    Manufacturing growth in the euro zone slowed to a two-year
low at the end of the third quarter, according to the latest IHS
Markit purchasing managers' indices.
    ""Overall, the picture remains for a less buoyant
manufacturing sector in Q3, with not very strong signs yet of a
better outlook for the end of the year,"" noted Nicola Nobile, a
senior economist at Oxford Economics.
    ""A slowdown in world trade and continuing concerns about the
escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue
to weigh on manufacturing sentiment.""
    German manufacturing growth slowed to just over a two-year
low in September, grew at the slowest pace in three months in
France and stagnated in Italy, marking the first time in two
years of no expansion. 
    Weaker export order growth was a common explanation for the
slowdown across the euro zone.
    And while British factories perked up unexpectedly in
September, halting a three-month run of slowing growth, the
bigger picture was subdued performance, just six months before
the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union.
    
    ASIA GROWTH FALTERING
    Two manufacturing surveys from China on Sunday pointed to
weakening in its vast manufacturing sector. A private poll
showed factory growth stalled after 15 months of expansion,
while an official gauge confirmed manufacturing was losing steam
under the weight of shrinking export orders [nL4N1WG0PZ].
    The first major readings on China for September suggest the
world's second-largest economy is continuing to lose momentum as
domestic demand weakens and U.S. tariffs bite. The combination 
is likely to prompt Beijing to roll out more growth-support
measures in coming months.
    However, analysts don't expect additional stimulus to start
stabilising China's economy until at least early next year.     
  
    Elsewhere in Asia, manufacturing also faltered in Vietnam,
Taiwan and Indonesia last month, with Taiwan's factories
expanding at the slowest pace in more than two years on sluggish
export orders, business surveys showed on Monday.
    Major economies like Japan and South Korea saw headline
activity readings hold up, but also suffered declines in export
orders, suggesting that increasing protectionism and concerns of
slowing Chinese demand were weighing on Asia's biggest
economies. [nS7N1DB00C][nS7N1DB00D]
    ""Global growth is now cooling, which we think is weighing on
foreign demand for Chinese goods irrespective of tariffs,""
Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
    India was among the few bright spots in Asia. Its factory
activity expanded more quickly in September on strong domestic
and export order growth, a welcome sign as policymakers worry
about a sharp drop in the rupee and fallout from global trade
frictions [nS7N1DB00E].
    While rising protectionism is expected to deal the world
economy a relatively modest blow this year, analysts expect
risks will intensify in 2019 as tougher U.S. tariffs kick in and
global borrowing costs rise.
    ""Countries that saw their currencies slump may be suffering
from rising import costs. There are also signs China's slowdown
and the trade friction are starting to hurt sentiment,"" said
Koji Kobayashi, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
    ""It would take time for companies to relocate production
from China to other countries. That means the initial impact of
the trade friction on Asian economies would be negative.""

    By Virginia Furness and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's bond yields rose on Monday
as fears that plans for a significant increase in the country's
budget deficit will spark a clash with the EU and exacerbate
already high debt levels weighed on investor sentiment. 
    Italian daily La Repubblica reported on Monday that the
European Commission was set to reject Italy's plans to lift its
budget deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2019 and open a procedure against its public accounts in
February. [nR1N1VZ00C]
    The proposed deficit is three times the previous
administration's target. [nL8N1WD1W3]
    Giovanni Tria, the economy minister in Rome, said on Sunday
that investments would fuel economic growth over the next two
years and debt would be put on a downward path.
    But that failed to reassure uneasy bond markets, with
short-dated bond yields briefly rising more than 15 basis points
on Monday <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>, while five-year Italian debt
insurance costs hit their highest level in a month.
   Barclays analysts said that unless Italy changed its fiscal
stance and/or the European Commission allowed for meaningful
fiscal leeway, frictions between Rome and Brussels were likely
to escalate in coming weeks. 
    They said the backdrop of weakening global demand and
prospects for a less accommodative monetary policy, meant
markets and the European Union would consider it unlikely that
Italy's fiscal measures would be able to raise growth to 1.6
percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020 as projected. 
    Barclays believes growth for 2019 will be just 0.9 percent. 
    ""The fiscal easing measures to be deployed by the government
are likely to be judged only modestly growth friendly,"" the bank
said in a note.
    The European Central Bank's monthly asset purchases fall by
half in October to 15 billion euros, eroding a key layer of
support for Italian bonds.
    
    DOWNGRADE RISK
    Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister said his bank's
base case was now for a sovereign downgrade from major credit
agencies. Moody's and S&P are expected to review Italy's ratings
later this month.
    Italy's public debt level of 131 percent of GDP,
proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece, makes
its bond market particularly vulnerable to any signs of fiscal
slippage.
    Italy's two-year government bond yield surged as much as 18
basis points before pulling back to 1.07 percent, still up 3 bps
on the day.
    Italian five-year yields were up 4 bps, though 10-year bond
yields dipped 2 bps to 3.12 percent <IT10YT=RR>, giving up early
rises.
    Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, said that
while the indicated rise in the budget deficit was not welcome
news, the implications were perhaps as not as dire as indicated
by Friday's bond sell-off.
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the
deficit next year to 2.4 percent of GDP instead of the widely
expected 2.0 percent of GDP should raise the average funding
cost (of Italian debt) by maybe some 5-10 bps – not by anything
like 25-40 bps,"" he said in a note.
    While Italian bonds struggled, the country's stock market
was 1.6 percent higher <.FTMIB> - outperforming the broader euro
zone. The euro was a shade firmer <EUR=>.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields were 2-4 bps higher, as
a last-gasp deal between the United States and Canada on Sunday
to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
pushed investors to riskier assets <BE10YT=RR>, <AT10YT=RR>.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain's departure from the
European Union next March will force a full review of the bloc's
sweeping new rules for markets, including tougher market-access
conditions for foreign trading platforms, a top French regulator
said on Monday.
    Robert Ophele, chairman of France's AMF markets watchdog,
said Brexit will force the EU to undertake a complete review of
the so-called MiFID II rules.
    ""I don't think there is a need for a major overhaul of
MiFID, but clearly there are some quick fixes, some elements
that should be adapted,"" Ophele told a conference held by AFME,
a banking industry body.
    The MiFID rules, which run to hundreds of pages, were only
introduced in January, a year late, because of the complexity
and the cost for trading firms, banks and even regulators to
implement them.
    France is actively courting banks based in Britain that are
opening EU hubs to avoid Brexit disruption, hoping they will
base their trading operations in Paris.
    Ophele said legislative fixes were needed to stop market
participants circumventing the rules and to improve the quality
of transaction data.
    ""MiFID II may be a complex piece of law, but that does not
mean we should shy away from re-opening it and fixing
deficiencies where evidence may show that we have gone too far
or have generated unintended consequences,"" Ophele told an
industry event in London.
    MiFID II has introduced caps on trading shares in the ""dark""
or away from transparent platforms like stock exchanges, but
Brexit will mean that much of that trading will no longer be in
the bloc.
    ""In the light of this, it makes sense to question whether
MiFID II's quantitative calibrations will be relevant tomorrow
when the UK is no longer in the EU,"" Ophele said.
    
    TOUGHER EQUIVALENCE
    Waivers from MiFID rules affecting commodities trading will
also need to be revisited given that nearly all metals, oil and
coal derivatives are traded in London, Ophele said.
    MiFID allows trading firms based outside the EU to serve
customers in the bloc if their home rules are aligned or
""equivalent"" to the bloc's own regulation.
    Ophele said that foreign firms should be made to comply with
more of MiFID's reporting and trading obligations for
derivatives and shares in order to qualify, dashing UK hopes of
an easing of the equivalence regime.
    Brussels will only decide if a foreign firm is equivalent if
it has cooperation agreements with its regulator. Ophele said
firms should assume there will be such an agreement between
supervisors in the EU and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.

    BRATISLAVA, Oct 1 (Reuters) - More people may be charged
over the killing of a Slovak investigative journalist in
February, the country's top prosecutor said on Monday.
    The killings of Jan Kuciak and his fiancée led to one of the
biggest crises Slovakia has faced. Nationwide protests over
corruption in the wake of the murders toppled the government of
Robert Fico, who had run the country for all but two of the past
12 years.
    Kuciak had written a series of articles on state corruption
as well as other topics.
    A court on Sunday ordered four people jailed until trial for
the murders after police carried out raids last week.
[nL8N1WG0RZ]
    ""We have more steps prepared which we want to take, so there
is high probability there will be more charges,"" Slovak general
prosecutor Jaromir Ciznar told a news conference.
    Prosecutors said the killer was paid 70,000 euros, of which
50,000 euros was cash and the rest forgiven debt.
    A woman arrested on Friday, identified only by initials A.
Zs. by the police, was the one who ordered the murder, although
it was not clear whether she was acting for someone or for whom.
    Kuciak was the intended target in the killing, which took
place at his home outside of Bratislava.

    * PM May's plan criticised in party and Brussels
    * Ministers seek unity at party conference

    By Elizabeth Piper
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain cannot be
bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening
the government's criticism of the European Union for taunting
Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks.
    May's ministers have come out one by one at their party's
annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that
they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to
show ""respect"" in the talks to end Britain's membership.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the
country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than
40 years, May faces growing criticism over her plans to leave
not only in her governing party but also in Brussels.
    Party unity is on ministers' minds, encouraging the faithful
to direct their anger at the EU rather than at their prime
minister, who some eurosceptic campaigners accuse of leading
Britain towards a ""Brexit in name only"".
    Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond,
have moved to point out that leaving without a deal could hurt
Britain's economy, the world's fifth largest.
    Raab said he had called on the EU to match the ""ambition and
pragmatism"" Britain had put forward with May's Chequers
proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement
with her ministers was hashed out in July.
    ""Unfortunately, that wasn't on display in Salzburg,"" he
said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where
EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan.
    ""Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In
return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly
one-sided approach to negotiation.""
    ""What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British
government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of
economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our
country's interests,"" Raab said.
    Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg
summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the
atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt
May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit.
    A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing
him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: ""A piece
of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries"" ""certainly had an impact"",
one official said.
    
    ""GET SERIOUS""
    With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any
future relationship, the possibility of a ""no deal Brexit"" has
increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a
worst case scenario.
    But one source close to the government said there was now a
sense that the EU had realised that the tone set in Salzburg was
""perhaps a bit off"" and, behind the scenes, conservations
between the two sides were more constructive.
    Hammond, for one, was keen to set a more positive tone.
    ""The mood is undoubtedly that people want to do a deal with
the UK,"" he told BBC TV.
    ""Clearly there has been a hit to the economy through the
uncertainty the Brexit process has caused. Many businesses are
sitting on their hands frankly waiting to see what the outcome
of this negotiation is before confirming investment plans.""
    But his softer line won less support at the conference than
those adopted by Raab, trade minister Liam Fox and foreign
minister Jeremy Hunt, who on Sunday compared the EU with the
Soviet Union which could turn into a prison from which not only
Britain would want to escape. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    It was Raab, winning a standing ovation for his story about
his father's journey from then Czechoslovakia after the Nazi
invasion, who summed up Britain's new combative stance.
    ""The EU's theological approach allows no room for serious
compromise,"" he said. ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get
serious.""

26,193,f79eead2d139ad0432c326f1215dff77,Croatia seen running budget surplus over next two years -major bank,2018-10-01 19:30:46,EUR,0.0,2018-10-01 19:32:22,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    ZAGREB, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Croatia is expected to run a
general budget surplus over the next two years after achieving a
similar result last year for the first time since it applied
European Union methodology, a major local bank said on Monday.
    ""We expect the fiscal consolidation to surpass expectations
this year again and we see a general budget surplus at 0.5
percent of gross domestic product. Next year we expect a surplus
to rise to 1.0 percent of GDP,"" Addiko bank's chief economist
Hrvoje Stojic said on Monday.
    Last year Croatia ran a budget surplus of 0.8 percent of
GDP. In the first half of this year a surplus amounted to 0.4
percent of GDP. The government officialy still targets a general
budget gap for 2018 of 0.5 percent of GDP, but Finance Minister
Zdravko Maric recently said a better outcome was possible.
[nL5N1VZ5GS]
    Presenting Addiko bank's traditional annual macroeconomic
forecast, Stojic said that positive fiscal trends were likely to
push Croatia's public debt towards 70 percent of GDP at the end
of 2019. At the end of last year Croatia had a public debt of 78
percent of GDP.
    The Croatian government hopes to enter in 2020 the ERM-2, an
exchange rate mechanism that serves as a preparation for the
euro zone membership. A candidate country must remain in ERM-2
for at least two years during which time the exchange rate must
fluctuate only within agreed limits.
    The government wants Croatia to become a euro zone member in
the next six to seven years.
    Stojic said that Croatia's public debt could fall towards 60
percent of GDP by 2022. That debt level is one of the major
criterion for euro zone membership.

 (Adds turnaround in Italian stocks, adds U.S. stock futures)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Optimism about a reconstituted
free trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico
and what it could mean for trade relations elsewhere helped
world markets kick off the fourth quarter of the year in a
positive vein. 
    The United States and Canada salvaged NAFTA as a trilateral
pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that
had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century
[nL2N1WG084].
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.5 percent to a 27-year high,
followed by gains in European stocks markets, with Italian
shares in particular clawing back some of last week's losses and
U.S. stock futures indicating a sharply higher open on Wall
Street. [.N]  
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> was up 0.85 percent against the
dollar to a four-month high and the Mexican peso <MXN=> hit its
highest in over seven weeks, up nearly a percent on the day. 
    ""The trade deal is helping risk appetite across the board,
especially the Canadian dollar, and that will likely lift
appetite for emerging-market currencies across the board,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in
London.    
    A pan-European index of shares <.STOXX> was up 0.3 percent,
led by Italian stocks <.FTMIB>, which were up as much as 1.2
percent on the day, bouncing off a two-week low hit last week.
    On Friday, Italian stocks, bonds and the euro had all sold
off on worries over a budget proposal from Italy's new
anti-establishment government, particularly after a report said
the European Union was set to reject the plan [nR1N1VZ00C].
    But such were the scale of the losses that some analysts
believed the market had gone too far. 
    ""The math just does not justify the price action we saw on
Friday. Not even close!"" Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen wrote
in a note on Sunday.  
    It wasn't unalloyed optimism on Italy, however, with
short-dated bonds selling off with two- and five-year yields
higher 7-9 basis points, though there was some demand for
longer-dated debt. <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR> <IT30YT=RR> 
    The closely watched spread between Italian and German
10-year bond yields was at 268 basis points, about 30 bps wider
than this time last week, but comfortably below Friday's high of
278 bps. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR> 
    ""It is quite clear that the European Commission will not
like (the budget proposal),"" said Commerzbank rates strategist
Michael Leister. ""Brussels will give its opinion, which we think
won't be positive and ... the ratings agencies will opt for a
similar stance. A downgrade is our base case.""  
    The euro was also intially hit by worries about a rise in
Italy's fiscal deficit, dropping below the $1.16 mark <EUR=>,
but it recovered as the session progressed to trade slightly
higher at $1.1612.  
    Also casting a shadow on markets were two surveys on Sunday
that showed growth in Chinese manufacturing sputtered in
September as domestic and export demand softened [nL4N1WG01M].
    As a result, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.25 percent. China's
financial markets were closed for a holiday, as was Hong Kong's
stock exchange. 
    ""The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China
recently has likely weighed on purchasing managers' sentiment as
reflected by softer readings in trade-related sub-indices,""
economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.
    Oil prices strengthened with international benchmark Brent
hitting a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed
Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as other key
exporters increased production.
    Brent crude futures <LCOc1> rose 0.6 percent to as high as
$83.25 per barrel, the highest since November 2014, before
trading at $82.98, still comfortably higher on the day.

 (Adds more Hammond comments, CBI)
    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain cannot be
bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening
the government's criticism of the European Union for taunting
Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks.
    May's ministers have come out one by one at their party's
annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that
they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to
show ""respect"" in the talks to end Britain's membership.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the
country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than
40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not
only in her governing party but also in Brussels.
    Party unity is on ministers' minds, and they are encouraging
the faithful to direct their anger at the EU rather than at
their prime minister, who some eurosceptic Conservatives accuse
of leading Britain towards a ""Brexit in name only"".
    Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond,
have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a
deal could hurt Britain's economy, the world's fifth largest.
    But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the ""ambition
and pragmatism"" Britain had put forward with May's Chequers
proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement
with her ministers was hashed out in July.
    ""Unfortunately, that wasn't on display in Salzburg,"" he
said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where
EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan.
    ""Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In
return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly
one-sided approach to negotiation.""
    ""What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British
government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of
economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our
country's interests,"" Raab said.
    Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg
summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the
atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt
May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit.
    
    ""NO CHERRIES""
    A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing
him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: ""A piece
of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries"" ""certainly had an impact"",
one official said.
    With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any
future relationship, the possibility of a ""no deal Brexit"" has
increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a
worst case scenario.
    ""The world is watching,"" said Matthew Fell, UK chief policy
director at the Confederation of British Industry. 
    ""Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the
tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of
agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills
would be hugely helpful,"" he told Reuters.
    But one source close to the government said there was now a
sense that the EU had realised that the tone set in Salzburg was
""perhaps a bit off"" and, behind the scenes, conservations
between the two sides were more constructive.
    Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance.
    After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still ""be neighbours
and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,"" he
told the conference, again backing May's Chequers plan.
    ""Mr Tusk says it won't work. But that's what people said
about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.""
    But his softer line won less support at the conference than
those adopted by Raab, trade minister Liam Fox and foreign
minister Jeremy Hunt, who on Sunday compared the EU with the
Soviet Union which could turn into a prison from which not only
Britain would want to escape. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    It was Raab, winning a standing ovation for his story about
his father's journey from then Czechoslovakia after the Nazi
invasion, who summed up Britain's new combative stance.
    ""The EU's theological approach allows no room for serious
compromise,"" he said. ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get
serious.""

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): Brexit Vulnerability: Infrastructure and Whole 
Business Securitsations

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10044746

Fitch Ratings-London-October 01: Ports and airports would be most vulnerable in 
a ""no deal"" Brexit scenario in the infrastructure and whole business 
securitisation sector, with traffic declines and increased costs putting 
pressure on cash flows, Fitch Ratings says. Furthermore, less-liquid capital 
markets could increase refinancing costs.

As we have previously noted, political divisions within the UK and slow progress 
in negotiations with the EU mean there is <a 
href=""https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/10041705""> a wide range of potential 
Brexit outcomes.</a> A no deal Brexit would substantially disrupt customs, trade 
and economic activity. The UK economy could see weaker near-term growth or even 
contract as a result, and sustained sterling depreciation and increased 
inflation.

The short-term effects include immediate trade and travel disruptions on Brexit 
day that would notably affect Channel Link (CLEF), ports (ABP) and airports 
(Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester Airport Group) as World Trade Organisation (WTO) 
tariffs are levied, immigration controls implemented and airplanes are possibly 
grounded if permissions and certifications to operate flights to the EU have not 
been secured.

In the medium term, weaker economic growth, a reduction in immigration, falling 
consumer confidence, higher inflation and sterling depreciation may contribute 
to lower traffic and adversely affect ports and airports revenues. 
Inflation-linked pricing may reduce the impact on revenues of ABP, Heathrow, 
Gatwick, and THPA, although this could be offset by inflation-linked debt for 
Heathrow, ABP, and Gatwick. Furthermore, ABP, Gatwick and MAG benefit from 
long-term contracts with revenue protection, which may offset some volume 
declines.

The patronage of pubs could decline as a result of falling consumer confidence 
and a weaker pound, making it most affected in the whole business securitisation 
(WBS) segment. Pubs and leisure services have benefited from the freedom of 
movement of labour within the EU. Restrictions could reduce the labour supply 
and increase wage cost pressure, given low levels of unemployment in the UK. 
Some businesses may shift food and drink suppliers to the UK from EU to mitigate 
the impact of sterling depreciation and of potential tariffs on imports.

WBS transactions typically benefit from fully amortising debt, which removes 
refinancing risk. Punch Taverns Finance B Limited is the only WBS transaction 
exposed to refinancing risk. Refinancing could also become more challenging for 
infrastructure deals with bullet maturities if capital markets tighten in the 
event of fractious Brexit negotiations.

Securitisations"" is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link

    MADRID, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain's exit from the European
Union will likely trigger a period of high uncertainty that may
significantly impact Banco Santander's <SAN.MC> business, the
Spanish lender said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    The document, which details Brexit's potential impact on
Santander's UK operations including its operating results and
its ability to hire and retain staff, was the most specific
statement to date from the euro zone's largest bank by market
value.
    ""There remains significant uncertainty as to the respective
legal and regulatory environments in which we and our
subsidiaries will operate when the UK is no longer a member of
the EU,"" the bank said in a filing on Friday to the SEC.
    ""This uncertainty, and any actions taken as a result of this
uncertainty, as well as new or amended rules, may have a
significant impact on our operating results, financial condition
and prospects,"" it said as part of risk assessment.
    In Britain, Santander's net profit fell 8.8 percent
year-on-year in the second quarter, partly due to ongoing
competitive pressure on income and costs related to regulation
and digital projects.
    Banco Santander also said in its filing it was finalising
the implementation of restructuring and strategic initiatives,
such as the ring-fencing of retail banking activities in the UK,
its third-largest market.
    The bank has already transferred 22.9 billion pounds ($29.9
billion) of assets and 20.7 billion pounds of liabilities to its
Madrid-based parent group in a move to comply with new rules
that come into force next year.
    Banks operating in Britain must separate deposit-taking
operations from riskier investment banking activities before
January 2019. Personal and small business banking services will
have to be provided by a 'ring-fenced bank'.
    Britain's looming exit from the EU and political uncertainty
in Brazil are expected to test the management skills of
Santander's new chief executive Andrea Orcel [nL8N1WC37J].
    So far this year, Santander has lost around 20 percent of
its value as lenders face pressure from low interest rates,
especially in Spain, its second-biggest market, while trying to
shift from traditional commercial banking towards more
digital-oriented lending to compete with fintech startups.

Britain's parliament was unlikely to pass a Brexit deal based on

trade deal.
    At the Conservative Party's annual conference, Greening, who
has described May's Chequers plan as the worst of all worlds,

    If May wins a Brexit deal with the European Union, she will
then have to secure its passage through parliament, where her

Northern Irish party.

    * Mercedes GLE aims to take the SUV to the next level
    * Peugeot e-Legend concept shows how far industry has to go

    By Joseph White
    PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Three new vehicles debuting at the
Paris car show this week will show investors and consumers the
challenges facing the global auto industry as it grapples with
the biggest technological changes in a century.
    A new BMW 3-series sedan, the latest in a line of cars that
defined the concept of a premium sports sedan, will aim to
reinvigorate a range that has ceded ground to SUVs and electric
drives, while the Mercedes GLE marks an attempt to take an SUV
to a new level, with some autonomous driving features. 
    And the Peugeot e-Legend concept stands for what automakers
need to do next, and fast: design electrified vehicles that are
both appealing and profitable.
    The new generation BMW <BMWG.DE> 3-series sedan will
immediately fight for attention with a different car bearing the
""3"" designation - Tesla Inc's <TSLA.O> electric Model 3. 
    Tesla's Model 3 is now out-selling the BMW model in the
United States, although the BMW 3 remains the bigger seller by
far worldwide.  
    Tesla's all-electric car challenges BMW and other
traditional premium brands for technological leadership with
software that can be constantly upgraded to improve the car's
performance and driver experience, and to add features.
    The new BMW 3-series will also fight for attention in Paris
- as in the marketplace - with the worldwide shift to SUVs. That
phenomenon will be represented by the new generation of the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> GLE sport utility, among other models.
    
    CONFLICTED RESPONSE
    The new GLE, which goes on sale next year, will come with a
new, 48-volt electronic suspension system that can vary the
shock absorbing function at each wheel, individually. Inside the
cabin, drivers and passengers can view information on two 12.3-
inch screens. 
    The GLE also takes another step toward automating the
process of driving, with a system that can steer and vary the
speed of the car within a marked lane up to 37 miles per hour.
The GLE can effectively pilot itself in rush hour traffic jams.
    Mercedes will offer in the GLE a 48-volt electrical system
that gives the vehicle an electric boost away from stops. That
offers a modest reduction in fuel consumption at a time when
regulators worldwide want automakers to eliminate their
oil-burning, internal combustion technology and go all-electric.
    The GLE highlights the auto industry's conflicted response
to the regulatory and consumer pressure to dump diesel
technology and accelerate the shift to all-electric vehicles. 
    Petroleum-fueled SUVs such as the Mercedes GLE generate the
bulk of profits for global automakers. All-electric Tesla gets
praise for its innovation, but is scrambling to show a profit in
the third quarter after a tumultuous year. [nL2N1WH00B]
    
    FANTASY CAR
    The challenge for established automakers is to design
electric cars compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay a
profitable premium to own them. [nL8N1WD63D]
    Legacy automakers have tended to produce electric cars that
are drab, small or strange. 
    PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> Peugeot e-Legend concept aims to break
that pattern with a battery-powered homage to the 1968 Peugeot
504 that looks like it could have starred in a late 1960s French
New Wave movie.
    While not destined for production, the e-Legend does reflect
a dilemma facing automakers like PSA - and its track-racing boss
Carlos Tavares - over how to reconcile connected, autonomous
cars with more traditional product traits such as driving
pleasure, where their expertise really lies.
    While the Peugeot fantasy car is self-driving, it can also
be driven manually, or flipped into a ""sharp"" autonomous mode
that accelerates and steers more aggressively - because, as the
company said in promoting the concept, ""boredom is not part of
our DNA"".

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The French Finance Minister
said on Monday Italy and all euro zone states should abide by
European Union fiscal rules, after Italy announced plans for a
large deficit.
    Bruno Le Maire said ""all states have to do their best to
stick to commitments"" when asked about Italy's fiscal plans.
    At a news conference before a meeting of euro zone finance
ministers in Luxembourg, Le Maire said states were waiting for
the Commission's assessment of the Italian budget.
    ""I think we have to go step by step,"" he told reporters,
clarifying that after the Commission's assessment of the budget,
euro zone states could put pressure within ""the political
framework"" provided by regular monthly meetings of euro zone
finance ministers.
    He added that respecting rules was even more important now
that the European Union was facing a serious threat as ""populist
and nationalist movements are on the rise."" 
    ""What is a stake now is clearly the future of Europe,"" he
said, urging euro zone states to respect common rules and to
quickly agree on a reform of the euro zone, because the bloc was
not fit to face a new major financial crisis, he said.

    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The new government
has chosen to fight stuttering growth with tax cuts and a

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The Italian government on Sept. 27 set an annual budget
deficit target of 2.4 percent of GDP for 2019-2021 as part of a
plan that focuses on welfare handouts, early retirement and some
tax cuts. The government has yet to publish the financial
details of its budget.
    - Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Sept 30. that
investment will fuel economic growth over the next two years.
This would allow Italy’s public debt to fall by 1 percentage
point of GDP per year over the three-year period, despite the
increased deficit. Italy’s debt came in at 131 percent of GDP in
2017.
    - An extraordinary investment plan envisages 3.4 billion
euros of spending in 2019, about 0.2 percent of GDP, and double
that the following year, Tria said in an interview with Il Sole
24 Ore newspaper. 
    - Tria said investment spending will boost Italy’s growth to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2019. Without the budget stimulus, growth
would only be 0.9 percent, he said.
    - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a separate investment
plan involving state-owned companies would see 38 billion euros
invested over the next 15 years.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government has chosen to fight stuttering growth with handouts
and tax cuts. Ministers believe spending measures that will
expand the budget deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP next year should
boost domestic consumption and help increase economic growth to
1.6 percent. However, the plan lacks a strategy to tackle
stubbornly high youth unemployment.
    While Italy’s overall jobless rate has fallen to pre-crisis
levels, unemployment among those aged less than 24 ticked up to
31 percent in August. Nearly 30 percent of those between 20 and
34 are not studying, working nor training – the worst rate in
the European Union, Eurostat data show. 
    That radical parties that make up Italy’s new government are
trying to partly address the issue through welfare support. The
so-called “citizens’ income” is the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement’s most important electoral promise. The measure which
will cost 10 billion euros a year envisages handing a monthly
check worth up to 780 euros a month to those living below the
poverty line, including pensioners. Labour Minister Luigi Di
Maio says the handout could benefit 6.5 million recipients,
though those who are working age must prove they are actively
seeking a job.
    The generous approach could be a much-needed stopgap for
Italy’s unemployed, particularly the young. In the country’s
impoverished southern regions, where 5-Star won more than half
of the votes, almost one in two young Italians is economically
inactive.
    Yet, bigger handouts will do little to improve the long-term
situation if no new jobs are created. The government hopes that
lowering the retirement age will create 400,000 new vacancies.
But the threat of global trade war, rising yields on Italian
government bonds and uncertainty about Italy’s role in the EU
may make businesses reluctant to swiftly substitute departing
older workers with new ones. Morale among Italian manufacturers
hit a 20-month low in August. Think thank Prometeia reckons that
while extra spending should boost growth by about 0.3 percentage
points of GDP in 2019, this could be cancelled out by higher
borrowing costs and growing uncertainty.
    Italy has openly challenged EU rules by opting for
expansionary policies that might boost its public debt. The
danger is that what it gives with one hand, it will take with
the other.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS AND SUPPORT RATING 

Fitch has withdrawn Banco Popular's IDRs and Support Rating following the 
completion of the bank's merger with Banco Santander, which resulted in Banco 
Popular's assets and liabilities being transferred to Banco Santander. Banco 
Popular has ceased to exist as a legal entity. 

SENIOR DEBT AND DEPOSIT RATINGS

Banco Popular's (and its funding vehicle BPE Financiaciones S.A.) senior 
unsecured debt has been transferred to Banco Santander and is now rated in line 
with Banco Santander's IDRs. Banco Popular's deposit ratings are now rated in 
line with those of Banco Santander.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

SENIOR DEBT AND DEPOSIT RATINGS

The debt classes are performing and, following the transfer to Banco Santander, 
Fitch considers its risk profile to be the same as the same class of debt issued 
by Banco Santander and thus sensitive to the same factors affecting Banco 
Santander's Long- and Short-Term IDRs.

The rating actions are as follows: 

Banco Popular Espanol, S.A.

Long-Term IDR: withdrawn at 'A-' 

Short-Term IDR: withdrawn at 'F2'

Support Rating: withdrawn at '1'

Long-term deposit rating; affirmed at 'A', transferred to Banco Santander

47,277,294dd7587a315cf9d4aa44cdd9d61960,UPDATE 1-Hungary has financing buffers to cover EU funds gap - debt agency CEO,2018-10-01 22:59:52,EUR,0.40051,2018-10-01 23:00:05,"{'EUR': 'Neutral', 'CNY': 'Neutral'}","    BUDAPEST, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Hungary has around 730 billion
forints ($2.63 billion) worth of buffers from debt issuance to
finance a budget deficit which is widening due to a lag in
payments of EU development funds, the chief executive of the AKK
debt agency said on Monday.
    Gyorgy Barcza told Reuters the figure included 1 billion
euros in proceeds from a euro bond issued last week. The AKK
will decide only later this year on how to use this money.
    A dispute between Hungary and the European Commission about
some EU-funded projects may not be settled this year which could
delay payments from the European Union, a Commission source said
last month. [nL8N1W54RN]
    According Finance Ministry data, in the first eight months
the cash-flow deficit widened to 1.646 trillion forints,
exceeding the full-year target of 1.361 trillion in the 2018
budget largely due to a delay in payments from Brussels.
    Barcza said the AKK was running about 200 billion forints
above plan with forint-denominated government bond issues, and
200 billion ahead with issues of government securities to retail
customers. This, together with the proceeds from the euro bond
amounts to a total of 730 billion forints, he said.
    ""This (EU funds' lag) has been a recurring issue for years.
The scale and amount changes, as there was a pre-financing gap
last year and the year before, but this year it could be
bigger,"" Barcza said in an interview.
    He said the AKK was not planning to exceed its 20 percent
target for the proportion of debt denominated in foreign
currency within total debt. At the end of August it stood at
19.5 percent. 
    Barcza said the end-year public debt target of 73.2 percent
of economic output was reachable even with the current weaker
forint levels.
    Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has gradually
shifted Hungary's debt programme to forint-denominated paper,
aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign currency debt that has
made it vulnerable to shifts in global sentiment in the past.
    Barcza said Hungary can issue a further 2 billion renminbi
worth of bonds in the Chinese market under a current programme
that runs until the end of June 2019, and the AKK would like to
use this possibility. Last year Hungary issued 1 billion
renminbi worth of three-year ""Panda"" bonds. 
    ""Slowly but continuously, we can establish our presence
there,"" Barcza said.
($1 = 277.9000 forints)

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government has chosen to fight stuttering growth with handouts
and tax cuts. Ministers believe spending measures that will
expand the budget deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP next year should
boost domestic consumption and help increase economic growth to
1.6 percent. However, the plan lacks a strategy to tackle
stubbornly high youth unemployment.
    While Italy’s overall jobless rate has fallen to pre-crisis
levels, unemployment among those aged less than 24 ticked up to
31 percent in August. Nearly 30 percent of those between 20 and
34 are not studying, working nor training – the worst rate in
the European Union, Eurostat data show. 
    That radical parties that make up Italy’s new government are
trying to partly address the issue through welfare support. The
so-called “citizens’ income” is the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement’s most important electoral promise. The measure which
will cost 10 billion euros a year envisages handing a monthly
check worth up to 780 euros a month to those living below the
poverty line, including pensioners. Labour Minister Luigi Di
Maio says the handout could benefit 6.5 million recipients,
though those who are working age must prove they are actively
seeking a job.
    The generous approach could be a much-needed stopgap for
Italy’s unemployed, particularly the young. In the country’s
impoverished southern regions, where 5-Star won more than half
of the votes, almost one in two young Italians is economically
inactive.
    Yet, bigger handouts will do little to improve the long-term
situation if no new jobs are created. The government hopes that
lowering the retirement age will create 400,000 new vacancies.
But the threat of global trade war, rising yields on Italian
government bonds and uncertainty about Italy’s role in the EU
may make businesses reluctant to swiftly substitute departing
older workers with new ones. Morale among Italian manufacturers
hit a 20-month low in August. Think thank Prometeia reckons that
while extra spending should boost growth by about 0.3 percentage
points of GDP in 2019, this could be cancelled out by higher
borrowing costs and growing uncertainty.
    Italy has openly challenged EU rules by opting for
expansionary policies that might boost its public debt. The
danger is that what it gives with one hand, it will take with
the other.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The Italian government on Sept. 27 set an annual budget
deficit target of 2.4 percent of GDP for 2019-2021 as part of a
plan that focuses on welfare handouts, early retirement and some
tax cuts. The government has yet to publish the financial
details of its budget.
    - Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Sept 30. that
investment will fuel economic growth over the next two years.
This would allow Italy’s public debt to fall by 1 percentage
point of GDP per year over the three-year period, despite the
increased deficit. Italy’s debt came in at 131 percent of GDP in
2017.
    - An extraordinary investment plan envisages 3.4 billion
euros of spending in 2019, about 0.2 percent of GDP, and double
that the following year, Tria said in an interview with Il Sole
24 Ore newspaper. 
    - Tria said investment spending will boost Italy’s growth to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2019. Without the budget stimulus, growth
would only be 0.9 percent, he said.
    - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a separate investment
plan involving state-owned companies would see 38 billion euros
invested over the next 15 years.

    NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - A last-minute agreement between
the United States and Canada to rescue a trilateral NAFTA accord
with Mexico drove up global stock markets and the Canadian
dollar on Monday. 
    The new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
announced on Sunday rescues a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that
was on the brink of collapse after nearly a quarter century.
[nL8N1WH2Z5]      
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 266.92 points,
or 1.01 percent, to 26,725.23, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 20.39
points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,934.37 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 43.99 points, or 0.55 percent, to 8,090.34.
    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS>
gained 0.34 percent.
    ""The trade deal is helping risk appetite across the board,
especially the Canadian dollar, and that will likely lift
appetite for emerging-market currencies across the board,"" said
Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in
London.    
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> was up 0.85 percent against the
dollar at a four-month high and the Mexican peso <MXN=> hit its
highest in over seven weeks, up nearly a percent on the day. 
    USMCA is aimed at bringing more jobs into the United States,
with Canada and Mexico accepting more restrictive commerce with
the United States, their main export partner. 
    It also effectively maintains the current auto sector and
largely spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S.
tariffs on their vehicles, although it will make it harder for
global auto makers to build cars cheaply in Mexico.[nL2N1WH04V]
     Shares of U.S. carmakers rose, with Ford <F.N> rising 1.6
percent and General Motors up <GM.N> 1.5 percent.
    The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.15
percent, led by Italian stocks <.FTMIB>, which bounced off
two-week lows hit last week.
    On Friday, Italian stocks, bonds and the euro had all sold
off on worries over a budget proposal from Italy's new
anti-establishment government, particularly after a report said
the European Union was set to reject the plan [nR1N1VZ00C].
    But such were the scale of the losses that some analysts
believed the market had gone too far. 
    ""The math just does not justify the price action we saw on
Friday. Not even close!"" Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen wrote
in a note on Sunday.  
    The euro was also initially hit by worries about a rise in
Italy's fiscal deficit, dropping below the $1.16 mark <EUR=>,
but it recovered as the session progressed to trade slightly
higher at $1.1612.  
    Also casting a shadow on markets were two surveys on Sunday
that showed growth in Chinese manufacturing sputtered in
September as domestic and export demand softened [nL4N1WG01M].
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 0.19 percent lower. 
    Benchmark Brent oil neared its highest since November 2014
on Monday, driven by concern about a supply crunch once U.S.
sanctions against Iran come into force next month. [nL4N1WH1CM]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> rose 0.6 percent to $73.69 per barrel and
Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $83.31, up 0.7 percent on the day.

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's finance minister told
his euro zone peers during a closed-door meeting in Luxembourg
on Monday that details of Italy's budgetary plans for 2019 were
still under discussion within the government, a European Union
source told Reuters.
    Giovanni Tria was asked to explain Rome's plans for a large
deficit in the next three years by the French and Dutch finance
ministers, the source said, although the topic was not on the
agenda of the monthly Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance
ministers.
    He explained the government plans but stressed that they
were not final yet and details were still under discussion, the
source said.
    A second source confirmed French Finance Minister Bruno Le
Maire had asked Tria details of the budgetary plans during the
meeting.
    Tria stressed that the draft budget was still under
discussion and the government's priorities were investment and
growth. 
    Last week, the government agreed its budgetary plans for the
next three years, which will be the basis for the 2019 draft
budget that will have to be submitted to the EU Commission by
mid-October.
    The first EU source said that at Monday's meeting, EU
commissioners said they were concerned by Italy's plans for a
deficit of 2.4 percent of  Gross Domestic Product in 2019, three
times higher than Italy's earlier commitments.
    But commissioners added it was too early to formulate their
position on the budget, as it had not been submitted yet.

agenda of the monthly Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance
ministers.
    He explained the government plans but stressed that they
were not final yet and details were still under discussion, the
source said.
    A second source confirmed French Finance Minister Bruno Le
Maire had asked Tria details of the budgetary plans during the
meeting.
    Tria stressed that the draft budget was still under
discussion and the government's priorities were investment and
growth. 
    Last week, the government agreed its budgetary plans for the
next three years, which will be the basis for the 2019 draft
budget that will have to be submitted to the EU Commission by
mid-October.
    The first EU source said that at Monday's meeting, EU
commissioners said they were concerned by Italy's plans for a
deficit of 2.4 percent of  Gross Domestic Product in 2019, three
times higher than Italy's earlier commitments.
    But commissioners added it was too early to formulate their
position on the budget, as it had not been submitted yet.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's shorter-dated bond yields
jumped to one-month highs on Monday, pushed up by fears that
plans for a significant increase in the country's budget deficit
will spark a clash with the EU and exacerbate already high debt
levels.
    European Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Italian
fiscal plans ""obviously"" were deviating from EU rules and
previous commitments. [nS8N1VJ00S]   
    Those comments followed a report by Italian daily La
Repubblica that the European Commission was set to reject
Italy's decision to lift its budget deficit to 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. [nR1N1VZ00C]
    The proposed deficit is three times the previous
administration's target. [nL8N1WD1W3]
   Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio late on Monday
accused EU officials of deliberately upsetting financial markets
by making negative comments about Italy's budget plans.
[nR1N1VZ00H]
    News late in the day that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
will return to Rome early from meetings in Luxembourg with his
EU counterparts to work on the budget plan fuelled the
uncertainty, analysts said. [nR1N1VZ00G]
    ""This afternoon we've had some very negative comments from
the euro group meeting but there is also uncertainty with Tria
coming home and that is part of the story,"" said DZ Bank rates
strategist Sebastian Fellechner. 
    Italy's two-year bond yield surged 25 basis points to 1.34
percent <IT2YT=RR>, five-year debt yields were 30 bps higher at
2.51 percent <IT5YT=RR>. Both hit one-month highs.
    Five-year Italian debt insurance costs also hit one-month
highs but held below levels seen in late May.
    Tria said on Sunday that investments would fuel economic
growth over the next two years and debt would be put on a
downward path.
    Still, Barclays analysts said that unless Italy changed its
fiscal stance and/or the European Commission allowed for
meaningful fiscal leeway, frictions between Rome and Brussels
were likely to escalate. 
    They said the backdrop of weakening global demand and
prospects for a less accommodative monetary policy, meant
markets and the European Union would consider it unlikely that
Italy's fiscal measures would be able to raise growth to 1.6
percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020 as projected. 
    Barclays believes growth for 2019 will be just 0.9 percent. 
    The European Central Bank's monthly asset purchases fall by
half in October to 15 billion euros, eroding a key layer of
support for Italian bonds.
    
    DOWNGRADE RISK
    Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister said his bank's
base case was now for a sovereign downgrade from major credit
agencies. Moody's and S&P are expected to review Italy's ratings
later this month.
    Italy's public debt level of 131 percent of GDP,
proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece, makes
its bond market particularly vulnerable to any signs of fiscal
slippage.
    As Italy's 10-year bond yield rose 15 bps to 3.29 percent
<IT10YT=RR>, the Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap
<DE10YT=RR> widened to around 280 bps, its highest in a month.
    ""We feel ultimately markets will exert pressure back on them
(Italy) again as spreads widen and at some point refunding costs
become much more expensive,"" said Guy Miller, chief market
strategist and head of macroeconomics at Zurich Insurance Group.
    ""Hopefully that will give them a signal they can't continue
doing what they are doing as markets will react.""     
    Italy's stock market gave up early gains and was down 0.4
percent <.FTMIB> in late trade. The euro was a shade weaker
<EUR=>.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields were 1-2 bps higher, as
a last-gasp deal between the United States and Canada on Sunday
to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
pushed investors to riskier assets. [nL2N1WG084]

 (Adds EU reaction to Soviet Union jibe)
    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain cannot be
bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening
the government's criticism of the European Union for taunting
Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks.
    May's ministers have come out one by one at their party's
annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that
they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to
show ""respect"" in the talks to end Britain's membership.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the
country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than
40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not
only in her governing party but also in Brussels.
    Highlighting the depth of the divide, the Conservative Party
conference was mostly viewed with indignation by EU figures on
Monday after Britain's foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the
bloc to the Soviet Union. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    Party unity is on British ministers' minds, however, and
they are encouraging the faithful to direct their anger at the
EU rather than at their prime minister, who some eurosceptic
Conservatives accuse of leading Britain towards a ""Brexit in
name only"".
    Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond,
have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a
deal could hurt Britain's economy, the world's fifth largest.
    But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the ""ambition
and pragmatism"" Britain had put forward with May's Chequers
proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement
with her ministers was hashed out in July.
    ""Unfortunately, that wasn't on display in Salzburg,"" he
said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where
EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan.
    ""Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In
return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly
one-sided approach to negotiation.""
    ""What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British
government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of
economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our
country's interests,"" Raab said.
    Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg
summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the
atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt
May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit.
    
    ""NO CHERRIES""
    A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing
him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: ""A piece
of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries"" ""certainly had an impact"",
one official said.
    With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any
future relationship, the possibility of a ""no deal Brexit"" has
increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a
worst case scenario.
    ""The world is watching,"" said Matthew Fell, chief UK policy
director at the Confederation of British Industry. 
    ""Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the
tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of
agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills
would be hugely helpful,"" he told Reuters.
    But one source close to the government said there was now a
sense that the EU had realised that the tone set in Salzburg was
""perhaps a bit off"" and, behind the scenes, conversations
between the two sides were more constructive.
    Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance.
    After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still ""be neighbours
and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,"" he
told the conference, again backing May's Chequers plan.
    ""Mr Tusk says it won't work. But that's what people said
about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.""
    But his softer line won less support at the conference than
those adopted by Raab, trade minister Liam Fox and Hunt, who
likened some of the EU's behaviour to that of the Soviet Union. 
    The jibe was particularly felt by those eastern members of
the bloc who fell into Moscow's orbit after World War Two and
only regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991. They joined the EU more than a decade later.
    Lithuania's EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt
he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed
by the Soviet KGB state security agency.
    ""Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and
Soviet Union,"" he said. ""Anytime. Whatever helps.""
    The European Commission told Hunt to study history and
Poland's former foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, denounced
the comments as ""cheap and offensive.""
    But back in Birmingham, it was Raab, winning a standing
ovation for his story about his father's journey from then
Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion, who summed up Britain's
new combative stance.
    ""The EU's theological approach allows no room for serious
compromise,"" he said. ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get
serious.""

 (Adds source on potential size of issue, roadshows)
    DUBLIN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Ireland announced plans on Monday
to issue its first ""green bond"" during the final quarter that a
market source said could raise between 2 and 3 billion euros and
follow a series of meetings with investors over the next two
weeks.
    Ireland's debt agency first flagged its plans to diversify
into the increasingly popular category of green securities
earlier this year. Last month it said it would hold roadshows in
the coming weeks to brief investors on the green bonds, which
raise capital for projects with environmental benefits.
    The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and
government representatives met investors in Paris on Monday and
will travel to London and Scandanavia later this week before a
further meeting in Dublin next week, the source said.
    The bond, which the NTMA plans to issue in the next three
months subject to market conditions, will be sold via a
syndication of banks, it said in a statement. 
    Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall
bond market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and
companies look to tap the appetite for climate-friendly
investments.
    Global green bond issuance hit a record $155.5 billion in
2017, surpassing previous estimates, and could reach $250
bln-$300 bln this year, research from the Climate Bonds
Initiative (CBI) showed in January. [nL8N1P5335]
    Ireland has so far raised 13.5 billion euros of the 14 to 18
billion euros it plans to issue in long-term debt this year, and
will also hold one more regular bond auction on Nov. 8.

    ROME, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's so-called citizens' wage, to
be introduced next year as part of the government's first
budget, will take the form of a pre-charged electronic shopping
card, deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Monday.
    The citizen's wage is the flagship policy of Di Maio's
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which has governed since June
with the right-wing League, and it is a centrepiece of Rome's
big-spending 2019 budget outlined last week.
    The budget sets aside 10 billion euros ($11.57 billion) for
the initiative, which will provide up to 780 euros per month to
the poorest Italians and which Di Maio has said will ""abolish
poverty"" in the euro zone's third largest economy.
    The scheme has yet to be finalised, but Di Maio gave some
details in a pre-recorded television interview on Monday. 
    ""It will be charged onto an electronic card which can be
used in Italian shops,"" he said, adding that this would boost
private consumption, economic growth and sales tax revenues.
    ""This way our gross domestic product will expand more than
expected,"" he said, adding that the income will only be
available to Italians who have been resident in the country for
at least 10 years.
    Government officials have said the money will first be
available to pensioners, from January, and gradually introduced
to all people below the poverty line some months later.
    Single people living in poverty will have their income
topped up to 780 euros per month, while for those in a family

    Italy has been the most sluggish economy in the euro zone
since the start of monetary union almost two decades ago and the
number of people living in poverty has tripled in the last 10
years, according to official data.
    The number living in ""absolute poverty"" rose to 5.1 million
last year, or 8.4 percent of the population, national statistics
bureau ISTAT said in June, despite a fourth consecutive year of
modest economic growth.
    ISTAT defines absolute poverty as the condition of those who
cannot buy goods and services ""essential to avoid grave forms of
social exclusion"".

    * Collomb plans to run for Lyon mayor post again in 2020
    * Macron confirms confidence in Collomb, asks him to stay

 (Adds Collomb spokeswoman comment, background)
    PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - French Interior Minister Gerard
Collomb, one of President Emmanuel Macron's closest allies,
offered to step down on Monday but Macron refused to accept his
resignation, Macron's office said. 
    Two weeks ago, Collomb announced plans to quit the
government and run for election as mayor of the eastern French
city of Lyon in 2020, and indicated he would resign following
European Parliament elections in May 2019. [nL8N1W40RV]
    ""Following the attacks on the minister since he said he
would be a candidate for the Lyon mayor post, the president has
confirmed his confidence in him and has asked him to remain
fully committed to his mission,"" an official at the Elysee
presidential palace said, confirming a report on French daily Le
Figaro's website. 
    A spokeswoman for Collomb confirmed that he had explained
the motives for his resignation to Le Figaro.
    Le Figaro reported that Collomb, 71, had offered to resign
because he did not want the interior ministry to be destabilised
by his decision to run again for mayor of Lyon, a post he held
from 2001 until 2017. 
    Collomb, a former Socialist party stalwart who was one of
the first top French politicians to join Macron's budding
centrist party, had in recent weeks been critical of Macron, and
had spoken of a ""lack of humility"" in Macron's administration.
    Macron's approval ratings have plunged to about 30 percent,
from around 60 percent shortly after he was elected in May 2017.
Critics say his policies favour the rich and his personal manner
is often described as aloof and arrogant. 
    Collomb has said big election victories tended to generate
an atmosphere where leadership appeared to lose touch with
voters' grievances. He has also lamented several mistakes, in
particular the handling of a scandal involving an Elysee Palace
security official, caught on camera beating up May Day
protesters. [nL8N1WC1WZ]

67,450,3c89240076ae4d3deae7f9524e61a664,ONB's Nowotny warns against taking bank supervision away from central bank,2018-10-02 15:39:57,EUR,3.1227099999999997,2018-10-02 15:40:03,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    VIENNA, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Austrian central bank governor
Ewald Nowotny warned against taking away banking supervision
responsibilities from the ONB, telling ORF radio on Tuesday such
a move would be unique in Europe and increase risks in case of a
new crisis.
    Austria's finance ministry is currently reviewing the
structure of the country's banking supervision, partly due to
the court of auditors' criticism of overlapping approaches. 
    The supervision of banks operating in Austria is, within the
European Central Bank's banking watchdog SSM, shared by the ECB,
the Financial Market Authority (FMA) and the ONB.
    The national bank is in charge of fact finding. It
undertakes on-site inspections, analyzes information, drafts
reports and processes data reporting. The FMA monitors
compliance with the relevant rules and is also the Austrian
resolution authority.    
    The finance ministry has said that a complete transfer of
competencies to the FMA was one option being discussed.
    ""This would be... unique in Europe. In virtually all
European states, the central bank is closely involved in banking
supervision,"" Nowotny, who is also a member of the ECB's
governing council, said. 
    Taking banking supervision tasks from the ONB would be a
""dangerous path"" that could hit the banks and the Austrian
economy, he said. As a central bank is involved in bank rescue
operations in the event of a crisis, it was important to have
first hand information and to share information with the other
European central banks.    
    ""In the event of a crisis, the central bank could not react
as quickly as it does now because it would be cut off from the
complete and concrete knowledge of the situation of the
individual banks.""

    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Owners of older diesel cars in
German cities where the air is particularly polluted should be
able to choose between trade-in incentives and a hardware
retrofit, coalition parties have agreed, a paper seen by Reuters
on Tuesday showed.
    After marathon talks into the night, Chancellor Angela
Merkel and leaders of her coalition partners announced in the
early hours that they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in
cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans. 
    Initially there were no details of the deal but the document
said German carmakers had agreed to offer an exchange programme
with attractive trade-in incentives or discounts for owners of
diesel vehicles of the Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standard.
    If owners of a Euro 5 model wanted a hardware retrofit with
a so-called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system and if
this was available and appropriate, the German government
expects the carmakers to shoulder the costs for this, the
document said.
    On delivery vehicles and trade vans, the government would
subsidise hardware retrofits with SCR systems by up to 80
percent, the document said.
    There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4
standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5
million cars on the roads in Germany, according to official
figures.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a five-week
low on Tuesday after a senior official from Italy's ruling party
said most of the country's problems would be resolved if it
scrapped the euro for its own currency. 
    Markets are highly sensitive to Italian political
developments after the ruling parties proposed a budget with a
higher-than-expected deficit target, exacerbating tensions with
other euro zone leaders and worrying investors who want Rome to
bring its large debts under control.
    The euro's weakness combined with another push higher by the
dollar, as investors shrugged off signs dollar long positions
had become stretched to buy into the U.S. currency.
    ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one
side and Italy on the other ... There's a lot of headline risk
about,"" said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX Strategy at Credit
Agricole.
    Marinov, however, said he did not expect the Italian saga to
weigh heavily on the euro in the medium term because there was
""no real evidence of contagion"" that would worry the European
Central Bank and prompt it to postpone a gradual end to its
fiscal stimulus.
    The euro <EUR=> skidded half a percent to as low as $1.1525,
almost its weakest since Aug 21.
    Most of the losses came after Claudio Borghi, the economic
head of the ruling League party, said Italy would enjoy more
favourable economic conditions outside the euro zone
[nR1N1VZ00K].
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who has accused
European Union officials of deliberately upsetting financial
markets with negative comments about Italy's budget plans, also
said Italy would not change its budget deficit targets
[nL8N1WI14R].
    The euro also fell against the Swiss franc, often bought as
a safe haven in times of market flux, which added 0.4 percent to
reach 1.1347 francs <EURCHF=>.  
    The dollar extended gains as risk appetite faded, after it
got a boost from the U.S.-Canada trade deal to replace the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.3 percent to 95.542, trading
at a three-week high.
    Fears about international trade conflicts between the United
States and major trading partners, including China, have lifted
the dollar this year, as has an increasingly confident U.S.
Federal Reserve.
    Flows from investors buying U.S. government bonds and stocks
have also underpinned dollar demand, analysts say.
    
    AUSSIE FALLS
    Against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the dollar fell 0.2 percent
to 113.74 yen as dollar bulls booked some profits.
    Following the U.S.-Canada trade deal announced on Monday,
the yen fell as low as 114.06 per dollar, its weakest since
November 2017.
    ""If we close this week above 114, that's going to be a
significant milestone,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch
manager at State Street Bank.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> fell half a percent to $0.7194
after the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates at 1.5
percent after its October policy meeting, a widely expected
decision given inflation and wage growth continue to disappoint.
[nL4N1WI00J]
    The Aussie, often viewed as a barometer of risk appetite,
was expected to do well out of the U.S.-Canada trade deal but
dollar demand and the central bank decision sent it lower on
Tuesday.
    The Canadian <CAD=> traded flat at C$1.2821 per dollar,
holding onto most of its 0.7 percent gains the previous day.
    The British pound <GBP=> dropped 0.4 percent to as low as
$1.2990, a three-week low.

    By Clara Ferreira-Marques
    SINGAPORE, Oct 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The suds at
Unilever <ULVR.L> <UNc.AS> could spill over to BHP <BHP.AX>
<BLT.L>. Some big shareholders say they will vote against the
consumer goods titan’s plan to collapse its dual-governance
structure. It gives the world’s largest miner cover as it
resists a call from pushy investor Elliott to do something
similar. 
  Unilever’s arrangement, with two companies under one
management team, dates back to the merger of a Dutch margarine
maker and a British soap producer some 90 years ago. There are
benefits to scrapping that in favor of a single Rotterdam home,
but significant costs, too. Most notably, the owner of Dove and
Ben & Jerry’s will, as a Dutch entity, get booted out of the
FTSE 100. Some UK shareholders also reckon they’re being taken
over without being paid a premium. 
   Even as investors decry Unilever’s consolidation effort, BHP
is under pressure to initiate one of its own. Elliott wants the
$125 billion company to collapse its own twin structure into a
new, Australian-listed entity. 
    The hedge fund has argued that BHP could remain in the UK
benchmark index, but that now looks unlikely. And its contention
that significant sales of stock could be avoided even after
exiting the FTSE 100 is hard to prove. An increased weighting
Down Under may not be enough to help. A unified BHP simply could
make up too much of the Aussie index – 15 percent, UBS estimates
– for funds to give it a full weighting.
    Under a new BHP chairman who favours ""listening tours"",
Elliott seems to be getting more of a hearing than when it
started agitating last year. Consultancy FTI earlier this year
estimated some $22 billion of uplift for BHP on the back of the
plan to abandon the dual listing. 
   The miner does not dispute that its structure is unwieldy; it
simply argues the expense and risks of overhauling it outweigh
any upside. There is also no consensus that streamlining the
company would make it any easier to extract sufficient value
from esoteric Australian franking credits, as Elliott contends.
Other tax hits also might apply. The mutiny at Unilever only
makes the campaign for simplicity more complicated.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - British Prime
Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday the European Union was not
the same as the Soviet Union after her foreign secretary
provoked anger by likening the 28-member bloc to the USSR.
    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt cautioned the EU on Sunday
that it was set up to protect freedoms but the lesson from
Soviet history was that if you turned it into a prison then the
desire to leave would increase.
    Asked whether Hunt was right to have made the comment, May
said: ""As I sit around that table in the European Union there
are countries there who used to be part of the Soviet Union,
they are now democratic countries and I can tell you that the
two organisations are not the same.""
    With less than six months until Britain leaves the EU, May
has yet to reach a deal with the EU on the terms the Brexit
divorce and rebels in her Conservative Party have promised to
vote down any deal she makes. 
    Hunt's comment on the Soviet Union provoked anger in Europe,
especially among some eastern members of the EU which only
regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
    Lithuania's EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt
he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed
by the Soviet KGB state security agency.
    ""Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and
Soviet Union,"" he said. ""Anytime. Whatever helps.""
    Former British diplomats said the remark was unwise.
    ""This rubbish is unworthy of a British foreign secretary,""
said Peter Ricketts, the top diplomat in the Foreign Office from
2006 to 2010. ""The EU isn't a Soviet-style prison. Its legal
order has brought peace and prosperity after a century of war.""
    But some Brexiteers, who cast the EU as a stagnating project
that will eventually collapse under its own weight, said Hunt
was right.
    ""Jeremy Hunt is using my language, the EU is the new Soviet
Union,"" Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said.
    The Soviet Union, governed by the Communist Party from
Moscow, presented itself as the champion of world socialism
though opponents cast it as a ruthless empire which suppressed
dissent and led to the deaths of millions.
    Its rivalry with the United States dominated the 20th
century, until it crumbled in 1989-1991 after Mikhail Gorbachev
sought to reform the economy and institutions of the Soviet
Union.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    Among the stocks to watch this morning at the open is Akzo Nobel <AKZO.AS> after the Dutch
paintmaker fulfilled its promise of returning billions to shareholders. We'll also be watching

    MORNING CALL: ITALY BUDGET WOES SET TO WEIGH ON EUROPEAN OPEN (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this
morning with a lower open expected,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
    Yesterday, top euro zone officials warned Italy that its plan to borrow billions of extra
euros to fund spending pledges could tip the bloc back into crisis.[nL8N1WH6BL]
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 18 points lower at 7,477, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 57 points lower at 12,282 and Paris' CAC to open 21 points lower at 5,486.
    Over in Asia, stocks fell as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free
trade deal faded, with cautious views on the global economy curbing risk sentiment. [nL4N1WI0IR]

debt with negative yields fell to just over 33 percent in
September from 37 percent in August, the lowest since Tradeweb
started collating monthly data on the pool of negative-yielding
bonds on its trading platform.
    Bond yields across the world have risen in recent weeks in
response to hawkish rhetoric from central bank officials and as
strong economic data boosts expectations for tighter monetary
policies from major central banks.
    Of around the 7.43 trillion euros of the bonds in the
system, about 2.48 trillion euros, or 33.38 percent, yield less
than zero, Tradeweb data published late on Monday showed.
    Tradeweb's data shows around 18 percent of euro zone
government bonds yield less than the ECB's deposit rate of minus
0.4 percent, the lowest since Tradeweb started collecting data
on negative-yielding bonds in June 2016.
    Almost 17 percent of the euro-denominated investment-grade
corporate bonds available on the Tradeweb platform yielded less
than zero percent last month, the lowest since June 2016.
    Tradeweb's data is based on statistics as of the end of
September.

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Union needs
clearer rules against money laundering that would apply equally
to all EU countries, European Central Bank Vice President Luis
de Guindos said on Tuesday, but several governments, including
Germany, urged caution.
    The 28-nation bloc is grappling with a string of
high-profile cases of money laundering at banks in several
member states, including Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Malta and Latvia.
    ""A higher level of harmonisation of the applicable rules in
the form of a regulation should be considered"", de Guindos told
EU finance ministers during a public debate in Luxembourg. 
    An EU regulation is directly applicable in all EU countries,
but EU rules against money laundering are currently defined in
directives which give governments broad leeway in their
application. This has resulted in different levels of
enforcement and gaps in the EU framework.
    However, EU governments have long been reluctant to give
away national powers to monitor banks and fight crime.
    Many of them confirmed on Tuesday their scepticism to de
Guindos's appeal and to a European Commission's plan to slightly
strengthen common supervision against money laundering.
    Germany, the largest country of the bloc, asked for more
time in changing the current framework. 
    Replying to de Guindos's proposal on transforming directives
into a regulation, Joerg Kukies, Germany's state secretary at
the finance ministry said: ""We think this is not an easy thing
to do in the short term but something we would be very open to
discuss"".
    The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Estonia and Finland said more
time was needed to decide on which changes would be needed,
confirming the sceptical line they held in closed-door meetings
[nL8N1W74DQ].
    Hungary opposed any proposal that would reduce national
powers.

    * Daimler boss says some Brexit scenarios ""highly worrying""
    * PSA Europe boss says UK production could be affected

    By Edward Taylor and Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Carmakers ratcheted up their
warnings on Tuesday over a disorderly Brexit, with France's PSA
Group <PEUP.PA> and Germany's BMW <BMWG.DE> both saying UK
production would suffer if Britain leaves the European Union
without a deal.
    With less than six months before Britain is due to leave the
EU on March 29, businesses are increasingly alarmed about the
lack of agreement over future trading relations and the
possibility of tariffs, delays at ports and extra red tape. 
    The car industry, one of Britain's few manufacturing success
stories of recent decades, is particularly at risk given the
thousands of parts, engines and finished models that move
between Britain and the continent every day. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    BMW boss Harald Krueger told the Paris Motor Show he saw a
""50:50 chance"" of a disorderly, or 'hard Brexit', and that this
would lead the company to shift more production of its Mini
vehicles - currently focused on its Oxford plant in southern
England - to the Netherlands. [nL8N1WI29O]
    ""I told (UK Prime Minister) Theresa May and the European
Union that if there is a hard Brexit, both sides are losers. We
will no longer fulfil trade agreements and then we are forced to
build the car in the Netherlands,"" Krueger told journalists.
    Maxime Picat, the European head of Peugeot and Citroen maker
PSA Group, also said there would ""necessarily be an impact"" on
its UK production if Brexit meant the group had to make cars
separately for British and EU markets. [nL8N1WI1LI]
    ""We're not going to be dogmatic about it, and there's no
question of punishing the UK,"" he told Reuters in an interview
at the show.
    ""We'd take a look at our two factories, the state of our
business, and look for a solution. But I don't know where that
will lead us in terms of the sustainability of our sites.""
    Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of German carmaker
Daimler <DAIGn.DE>, also told the Paris event that scenarios
involving a disorderly Brexit were ""highly worrying.""
[nL8N1WI1LF]
    The executives' comments come as the British prime minister
said she was preparing to make a new offer to the EU aimed at
breaking the deadlock in the Brexit talks, and after other
carmakers, including Jaguar Land Rover, have warned of the risk
to jobs from a hard Brexit. [nL9N1VJ00D] 
    Automakers are also facing a range of other challenges,
including the rollout of costly electric vehicles, tougher
emissions rules and the potential disruption to trade from the
rise of protectionism. [nL8N1WH5YT]

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona/London-October 02: Fitch Ratings has assigned ABANCA 
Corporacion Bancaria, S.A.'s (Abanca, BB+/Positive/bb+) issue of EUR250 million 
perpetual non-cumulative additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital notes a final rating of 
'B'.

The final rating is in line with the expected rating Fitch assigned to the notes 
on 14 September 2018 (see ""Fitch Rates Abanca's AT1 Notes 'B(EXP)'"" at 
www.fitchratings.com).

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The notes are CRD IV-compliant perpetual, deeply subordinated, fixed-rate 
resettable AT1 debt securities. The notes have fully discretionary 
non-cumulative interest payments and are subject to partial or full write-down 
if any of the bank's standalone or consolidated, or ABANCA Holding Financiero, 
S.A's (AHF; topco) common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios fall below 5.125%. The 
principal write-down can be reversed and written up at full discretion of the 
issuer if a positive consolidated net income is recorded.

The rating assigned to the securities is four notches below Abanca's 'bb+' 
Viability Rating (VR), in accordance with Fitch's criteria for assigning ratings 
to hybrid instruments. This notching comprises two notches for loss severity in 
light of the notes' deep subordination, and two notches for additional 
non-performance risk relative to the VR given fully discretionary coupons and a 
high write-down trigger.

Fitch expects the non-payment of interest on this instrument will occur before 
any of the bank, the group, or the topco breaches the notes' 5.125% CET1 
write-down trigger, most probably when Abanca's or AHF's capital ratios approach 
their supervisory review and evaluation process requirement set at 11.375% for 
2018. Abanca's consolidated phased-in CET1 ratio was 14.66% at end-June 2018, 
providing the bank with a buffer from the write-down trigger. Given this, and 
Fitch's expectations for each entity's capital ratios, we have limited the 
notching for non-performance to two notches.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The AT1 notes' rating is primarily sensitive to changes in Abanca's VR. The 
rating is also sensitive to changes in their notching from Abanca's VR, which 
could arise if Fitch changes its assessment of the probability of their 
non-performance relative to the risk captured in the VR. This may reflect a 
change in capital management in the group or an unexpected shift in regulatory 
buffer requirements, for example.

Under Fitch's criteria, a one-notch upgrade of the AT1 instrument would be 
conditional upon a two-notch upgrade of Abanca's VR.

third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on 
in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,

Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the 
adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular

obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000

ministers agreed on Tuesday to remove the Pacific island of
Palau from an EU list of tax havens.
   The island had been included on the blacklist in March as its
tax rules and practices were deemed not in line with EU
standards.
    After it committed to changes, EU ministers agreed to move
it from the blacklist to a so-called grey list of jurisdictions
with low tax transparency standards but aiming to become less
opaque, an EU document shows.
    Six other jurisdictions remain on the blacklist. They are
Namibia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and the three U.S.
territories of American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   The EU blacklist was set up last December after revelations
of widespread tax avoidance schemes used by corporations and
wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills. It originally
included 17 jurisdictions.
   Fair tax groups and EU lawmakers have criticised the rapid
shrinking of the list and the fact that renowned tax avoidance
countries are not listed.
   Blacklisted jurisdictions could face reputational damage and
stricter controls on their financial transactions with the EU,
although no sanctions have been agreed by member states yet.
   Those who are on the grey list could be moved to the
blacklist if they do not honour their commitments.

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.
    ""Not many people like Trump for his views, but as a businessman he seems to be doing a
relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.
    ""What the market is looking for is to see further agreements with the EU, and the big prize
is a deal with China.""
    Here was ING forex analyst Viraj Patel's interpretation of the ""USMCA"". Our apologies if the
song is now stuck in your head.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    MORNING CALL: ITALY BUDGET WOES SET TO WEIGH ON EUROPEAN OPEN (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this
morning with a lower open expected,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

    Over in Asia, stocks fell as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The pound slid to a three-week low
on Tuesday on fears about a conflict over UK Prime Minister
Theresa May's Brexit plan escalating, with division on show at a
ruling Conservative Party conference.
    Sterling's fortunes are being driven by headlines about
May's proposal for Britain exiting the European Union in six
months and whether she can persuade the block and senior members
of her own party to accept it.
    In particular, traders are focused on a new offer Britain is
preparing to make to the EU on the Irish border, aimed at
breaking the deadlock in Brexit talks before a decisive EU
summit in late October. [nL9N1VJ00D]
    The pound spiked briefly on Monday on a report that Britain
might back down on customs checks between mainland Britain and
Northern Ireland, a major obstacle to Brexit. [nL9N1VJ00E]
    But, by 1000 GMT, sterling <GBP=D3> had relinquished all of
those gains and was trading down 0.6 percent versus a rallying
dollar at $1.2952, its lowest since Sept. 10. It was flat versus
a weaker euro at 88.79 pence. <EURGBP=D3>
    The leader of the Northern Irish party which props up May's
government, Arlene Foster, said Northern Ireland must leave on
the same terms as the rest of Britain. [nL9N1W7007]
    ""Foster saying we cannot be separated from the United
Kingdom .. is a reiteration of their position since the
referendum and the single most import feature in the whole
Brexit negotiation,"" Mizuho's head of FX hedge fund sales Neil
Jones said.
    At her party's annual conference this week, May is defending
her so-called Chequers plan for leaving the EU. Critics,
including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson who is due to
talk at the Tory conference on Tuesday, are openly defying her.
    ""The conference is a minefield for sterling. We're trading
from headline to headline,"" WorldFirst head of FX strategy
Jeremy Cook said.
    ""The bias for the pound is to the downside,"" he said.
    Analysts at MUFG said Monday's relief rally suggests that
""the pound is likely to trade with some volatility during the
remainder of this week"".
    A potential downside risk for sterling is the prospect of
May's own party challenging her leadership. 
    May said on Tuesday she planned to remain in the job ""for
the long term"" as she called on her party to back her plan for
Brexit. [nL9N1VJ00E]

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - British Prime
Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday the European Union was not
the same as the Soviet Union after her foreign secretary
provoked anger by likening the 28-member bloc to the USSR.
    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt cautioned the EU on Sunday
that it was set up to protect freedoms but the lesson from
Soviet history was that if you turned it into a prison then the
desire to leave would increase.
    Asked whether Hunt was right to have made the comment, May
said: ""As I sit around that table in the European Union there
are countries there who used to be part of the Soviet Union,
they are now democratic countries and I can tell you that the
two organisations are not the same.""
    With less than six months until Britain leaves the EU, May
has yet to reach a deal with the EU on the terms the Brexit
divorce and rebels in her Conservative Party have promised to
vote down any deal she makes. 
    Hunt's comment on the Soviet Union provoked anger in Europe,
especially among some eastern members of the EU which only
regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
    Lithuania's EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt
he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed
by the Soviet KGB state security agency.
    ""Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and
Soviet Union,"" he said. ""Anytime. Whatever helps.""
    When Hunt was asked on Wednesday whether the EU was like the
Soviet Union, he told CNBC: ""No, and they've got to be very
careful that the way they behave in these negotiations is
consistent with European ideals, and I don't think we've been
seeing that.""
    
    USSR?
    The European Commisison’s deputy head, Frans Timmermans,
said comparing the EU to the Soviet Union was insulting.
    ""Andriukaitis, was born in Siberia. Why? Because his parents
Lithuanians, were deported by the Soviet regime to the Gulag.
Vytenis didn't know sunlight, what it meant, he did not know
what the length of a day was, he hasn't seen an orange as a
child.""
    Former British diplomats said the remark was unwise.
    ""This rubbish is unworthy of a British foreign secretary,""
said Peter Ricketts, the top diplomat in the Foreign Office from
2006 to 2010. ""The EU isn't a Soviet-style prison. Its legal
order has brought peace and prosperity after a century of war.""
    But some Brexiteers, who cast the EU as a stagnating project
that will eventually collapse under its own weight, said Hunt
was right.
    ""Jeremy Hunt is using my language, the EU is the new Soviet
Union,"" Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said.
    The Soviet Union, governed by the Communist Party from
Moscow, presented itself as the champion of world socialism
though opponents cast it as a ruthless empire which suppressed
dissent and led to the deaths of millions.
    Its rivalry with the United States dominated the 20th
century, until it crumbled in 1989-1991 after Mikhail Gorbachev
sought to reform the economy and institutions of the Soviet
Union.

    FRENCH PRIVATISATIONS: HOW'S SAFRAN AS A TASTER? (1050 GMT) 
    The French government's sale of €1.25 billion worth of Safran shares comes as a reminder
that 2019 may be quite a busy year for equity capital markets in France. 
    A press release by SocGen, which was happy to tell the world it acted as an advisor on the
placement, reminds investors that the privatisation of 2.34 percent of the French aerospace firm
was ""the largest ECM deal in France in 2018"".
    With Macron planning to finance a 10 billion euro innovation fund, there should be many more
big ECM deals coming, notably in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA>. 
    Here's the French state's €83 billion portfolio of listed companies (valued on September 4
by the French Finance Ministry):

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.
    ""Not many people like Trump for his views, but as a businessman he seems to be doing a
relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.
    ""What the market is looking for is to see further agreements with the EU, and the big prize
is a deal with China.""
    Here was ING forex analyst Viraj Patel's interpretation of the ""USMCA"". Our apologies if the
song is now stuck in your head.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    MORNING CALL: ITALY BUDGET WOES SET TO WEIGH ON EUROPEAN OPEN (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this
morning with a lower open expected,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
    Yesterday, top euro zone officials warned Italy that its plan to borrow billions of extra
euros to fund spending pledges could tip the bloc back into crisis.[nL8N1WH6BL]
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 18 points lower at 7,477, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 57 points lower at 12,282 and Paris' CAC to open 21 points lower at 5,486.
    Over in Asia, stocks fell as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free
trade deal faded, with cautious views on the global economy curbing risk sentiment. [nL4N1WI0IR]

 (Recasts after Salvini, Conte comments; reslugs ITALY-BUDGET/)
    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy dug in its heels on Tuesday
over its budget deficit despite pressure from Brussels and its
euro zone partners, as leaders of the coalition in Rome
threatened to sue EU officials over a deepening market sell-off.
    The government last week set a deficit target of 2.4 percent
of economic output for the next three years. That tripling of
its predecessor's goal unnerved already jittery investors and
prompted criticism and calls for a rethink from the European
Commission.
    ""We are not turning back from the 2.4 percent target... We
will not backtrack by a millimetre,"" Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime
minister and leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement,
said in radio interview.
    As Italian bonds and banking shares sold off sharply on
Tuesday, Di Maio said there was ""no doubt"" the leaders of France
and Germany wanted the Italian government to fall, while one
lawmaker suggested the country would be better off outside the
euro.
    The ruling coalition, which joined forces in June on
promises to slash taxes and boost welfare spending, directed its
anger at Brussels. Its other deputy Prime Minister, right-wing
League leader Matteo Salvini, said it might seek compensation
from the EU over Italy's rising borrowing costs. 
    ""The words and the threats of Juncker and other high EU
bureaucrats continue to raise the spread (between Italian and
German bond yields). We are ready to seek damages from those who
want to harm Italy,"" Salvini said.
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which emerged from its third international bailout as
recently as August.
    While the headline deficit of 2.4 percent that Italy is
proposing would be within the Commission's 3 percent limit,
under the current plan the structural - or underlying - deficit
would rise, which runs contrary to EU rules.
    The Commission is also concerned the proposal will add to
Italy's huge public debt pile, proportionally the second highest
in the EU after Greece's. The government says the debt will fall
as the expansionary budget spurs economic growth.
    
    'STRICT WITH ITALY TO SAVE EURO'
    In Luxembourg, the Commission's Vice President for the euro
Valdis Dombrovskis said it was open to dialogue and hoped Italy
would bring the budget draft into line with EU rules.
[nL8N1WI1BG]
    On Monday, Juncker said the EU must be ""strict"" with Italy
to avoid putting the euro project at risk.
    Salvini called that a ""threat"" that ""no-one in Italy is
taken in by"". He said the government's priority was to respond
to its citizens' needs and criticism of its budget ""will not
stop us.""
    The government's task is made harder by the pressure on 
Italian bonds which intensified on Tuesday, when eurosceptic
League lawmaker Claudio Borghi said the country's economic
situation would improve outside the euro zone. [nL8N1WI11F]
[nL8N1WI0ZH]
    Borghi is not a minister and did not suggest the government
planned to drop the euro, and Di Maio and Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte later reiterated the official line that Rome has
no intention of leaving either the euro zone or the EU.
    ""The euro is our currency and for us it is unrenounceable,""
Conte said on Facebook. Declarations suggesting otherwise must
be seen as ""free and arbitrary opinions that have nothing to do
with the policies of this government.""
    Di Maio said Rome's adversaries were hoping to use financial
markets to weaken the ruling coalition, but their bid would fail
because the 5-Star/League alliance was more united than ever.
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, a moderating but seemingly
increasingly isolated voice in government who is a member of
neither party, left a gathering of EU finance ministers in
Luxembourg late on Monday to return to Rome to put the finishing
touches to the budget plan.
    The document is expected to be published in coming days but
could be released as soon as Tuesday.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Denmark has proposed a ban on
the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and hybrid from
2035, joining international efforts to promote electric-only
vehicles to reduce air pollution and combat climate change. 
    The government has previously come under fire for increasing
tax on electric cars in 2016, sending sales down from more than
3 percent of all new cars to almost zero, but now aims to follow
the example being set in an increasing number of countries.
    ""It is a big ambition that will be hard to achieve. But
that's exactly why we need to try,"" Danish Prime Minister Lars
Lokke Rasmussen told parliament on Tuesday.
    The plan requires parliamentray approval to become law and
will be presented to parliament next week.
    Britain and France have both pledged to ban new petrol and
diesel cars from 2040 in move that could hit the wealth of oil
producers and transform a car industry in which global carmakers
are scrambling to adapt to the brave new world of electric
vehicles. [nL5N1KH21I][nL8N1WH5YT]
    In Sweden, sales of electric cars make up more than 7
percent of all new car sales while more than half of all new
cars in Norway are electric or hybrid vehicles.  
    The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have all
said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025,
while the French government also aims to end the sale of new
gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040. [nL8N1JX2NI]
    Denmark, the cradle of wind power, aims to become fossil
fuel-free by 2050.

to phase out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion
engine, announcing that all Volvo car models launched after 2019

    ITALY: ""A MACRO NO MAN'S LAND"" (1140 GMT)
    While Italian assets are recovering slightly from this morning's slide - the FTSE MIB is now
down 0.6 percent, in line with the STOXX 600 - most analysts remain pretty downbeat about the
prospects for the economy, with GS going so far as to call this a new regime.
    ""Italian spreads to Bunds have entered a new regime, a macro no man's land,"" write GS
analysts. ""In our view, the prices of Italian assets are likely to remain lower and more
volatile (even compared with current levels).""
    Ultimately, GS is ""sceptical"" that the fiscal easing proposed by the government will
stimulate real GDP growth to rates above its forecast, saying fiscal expansion in high debt
countries leads to widening spreads which in turn increase banks' cost of funding, ultimately
impacting consumers and firms and crowding out private consumption and investment. 
    The euro has weakened and become more correlated to BTP spreads, GS notes - though that
relationship has faded since the euro zone crisis, as you can see below:

    FRENCH PRIVATISATIONS: HOW'S SAFRAN AS A TASTER? (1050 GMT) 
    The French government's sale of €1.25 billion worth of Safran shares comes as a reminder
that 2019 may be quite a busy year for equity capital markets in France. 
    A press release by SocGen, which was happy to tell the world it acted as an advisor on the
placement, reminds investors that the privatisation of 2.34 percent of the French aerospace firm
was ""the largest ECM deal in France in 2018"".
    With Macron planning to finance a 10 billion euro innovation fund, there should be many more
big ECM deals coming, notably in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA>. 
    Here's the French state's €83 billion portfolio of listed companies (valued on September 4
by the French Finance Ministry):

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.
    ""Not many people like Trump for his views, but as a businessman he seems to be doing a
relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.
    ""What the market is looking for is to see further agreements with the EU, and the big prize
is a deal with China.""
    Here was ING forex analyst Viraj Patel's interpretation of the ""USMCA"". Our apologies if the
song is now stuck in your head.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    MORNING CALL: ITALY BUDGET WOES SET TO WEIGH ON EUROPEAN OPEN (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this
morning with a lower open expected,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Iran has struck a deal with
Damascus to build a 400 million euro ($460 million) power plant
in Syria's coastal city of Latakia, a potentially lucrative deal
for Tehran to deepen its economic role after years of fighting
in the Syrian conflict.
    Iran's Minister of Energy Reza Ardakanian was quoted as
saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency that a memorandum
of understanding was signed on Tuesday.
    Since at least 2012, Iran has provided critical military
support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government,
helping it regain control of swathes of the country. Iran
experts say Tehran is now looking to reap a financial dividend.
    Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that the MoU was
signed by the head of the Iranian power and infrastructure group
MAPNA and head of the Syrian public authority for electricity
generation.
    The project is to be launched next year, IRNA reported.
    In 2017, Iran and Syria signed an agreement to repair
Syria’s power grid. The agreement involved restoring the main
control centre for Syria’s electricity grid in the capital
Damascus.

 (Adds reaction, Ashkin interview, context on CERN gender row)
    By Niklas Pollard and Ben Hirschler
    STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - A trio of American,
French and Canadian scientists won the 2018 Nobel Prize for
Physics on Tuesday for breakthroughs in laser technology that
have turned light beams into precision tools for everything from
eye surgery to micro-machining.
    They include the first female physics prize winner in 55
years.
    Canada's Donna Strickland, of the University of Waterloo,
becomes only the third woman to win a Nobel for physics, after
Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963.
    Arthur Ashkin of Bell Laboratories in the United States won
half of the 2018 prize for inventing ""optical tweezers"" while
Strickland shares the remainder with Frenchman Gerard Mourou,
who also has U.S. citizenship, for work on high-intensity
lasers.
    ""Obviously we need to celebrate women physicists because we
are out there and hopefully in time it will start to move
forward at a faster rate,"" Strickland told a news conference by
telephone, shortly after learning of the prize.
    The Nobel prizes have long been dominated by male
scientists, and none more so than physics.
    Strickland is the first female Nobel laureate in any field
in three years. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said last
year it would seek to more actively encourage nominations of
women researchers to begin addressing the imbalance.
    Her win comes a day after Europe's physics research centre
CERN suspended an Italian scientist, Alessandro Strumia, for
telling a seminar at the organisation's Swiss headquarters last
week that physics was ""invented and built by men"".
    Jim Al-Khalili, professor of theoretical physics at
Britain's University of Surrey, said on Twitter it was
""delicious"" that Strickland had won the Nobel prize just days
after Strumia's ""misogynistic"" comments.
    The inventions by the three scientists date back to the
mid-1980s and over the years they have revolutionised laser
physics.
    ""Advanced precision instruments are opening up unexplored
areas of research and a multitude of industrial and medical
applications,"" the academy said on awarding the nine million
Swedish crown ($1 million) prize.
    
    OLDEST WINNER
    Ashkin's work was based on the realisation that the pressure
of a beam of light could push microscopic objects and trap them
in position. A breakthrough came in 1987 when he used the new
optical tweezers to grab living bacteria without harming them.
    Ashkin is the oldest ever Nobel prize winner - but the
96-year-old is still busy with fresh research.
    ""I am busy working right now, writing an important paper on
solar energy,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    ""I'm surprised,"" Ashkin said about winning the prize. ""A guy
called me up on the phone and woke me up.""
    Mourou and Strickland's research centred on developing the
most intense laser pulses ever created by humans, paving the way
for the precision instruments used today in corrective eye
surgery and industrial applications.
    The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace
have been awarded since 1901 in accordance with the will of
Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, whose discovery of
dynamite generated a vast fortune used to fund the prize.
    Physics is the second of this year's crop of prizes and
comes after the medicine prize was awarded on Monday for 
discoveries about how to harness and manipulate the immune
system to fight cancer. [nL8N1WH2I4]
    However, for the first time in decades no Nobel Prize for
literature will be given this year after a scandal over sexual
misconduct allegations saw a string of members leave the board
of the Swedish Academy that awards it. [nL8N1WH2IO]

    HELSINKI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Finnish shoppers are about to
find out what they spend their money on at the supermarket after
S Group, the country's largest retailer, gave customers access
to their shopping history.
    S Group has been collecting detailed shopping data for years
through its popular loyalty bonus card, which is held by 3.7
million consumers in Finland, whose population is 5.5 million.
    ""Especially for our younger customers the opportunity to
track their own consumption can be a crucially important reason
to use our green (bonus) card, even more important than the
bonus itself,"" spokesman Veli-Pekka Aari said on Tuesday.
    While S Group's competitors are also eyeing opportunities to
collect and use data on people's shopping habits to personalise
their advertisement efforts, Aari said the idea of giving out it
to customers was the group's own.
    ""We may well be the first in the world to give customers
access to data on their consumption with this precision.""
    S Group, a co-operative owned by its customers, had a 45.9
percent share of the Finnish retail market in 2017, while it
also runs Finland's largest petrol station chain, department
stores, hotels and restaurants.
    While customers are able to look up what they have spent
over the last 12 months on product groups such as beef, yogurt
or beer, together with their shopping locations and usual
shopping hours, the information could become more detailed.
    ""A consumer could check how much, say sugar, the purchased
products have contained altogether, and then if they want,
compare their own sugar consumption with that of other
households of the same size,"" Aari said.
    Some consumers have been concerned by a lack of privacy
within the bonus system, although S Group said it was giving
customers not only access to their shopping data but also
increased control over its use.

    AFTERNOON SNAPSHOT: OFF LOWS (1523 GMT)
    Italian stocks <.FTMIB> and banks <.FTIT8300> have come well off earlier lows, while Europe
too has pared some of its earlier losses. There's still lot of stress on the market as
uncertainty over political risk in Italy looks here to stay but in the mix of political noise
there have been some less bearish headlines giving some support. 
    Here are a few:
    * PM Conte says euro is ""unrenounceable"" for Italy [nR1N1RB01S]
    * Italy's govt does not want to exit from the euro - Deputy PM [nR1N1VZ00N]
    * Italy has no plans to leave euro - League lawmaker Borghi  [nR1N1RB01P]

    In the snapshot you can see the move off this morning's lows for the STOXX <.STOXX> and the
FTSE MIB indexes.   
 
    Meanwhile, U.S. stocks futures are down as Italian jitters spread and relief from a reworked
NAFTA deal faded. [nL4N1WI2MJ]

    ITALY: ""A MACRO NO MAN'S LAND"" (1140 GMT)
    While Italian assets are recovering slightly from this morning's slide - the FTSE MIB is now
down 0.6 percent, in line with the STOXX 600 - most analysts remain pretty downbeat about the
prospects for the economy, with GS going so far as to call this a new regime.
    ""Italian spreads to Bunds have entered a new regime, a macro no man's land,"" write GS
analysts. ""In our view, the prices of Italian assets are likely to remain lower and more
volatile (even compared with current levels).""
    Ultimately, GS is ""sceptical"" that the fiscal easing proposed by the government will
stimulate real GDP growth to rates above its forecast, saying fiscal expansion in high debt
countries leads to widening spreads which in turn increase banks' cost of funding, ultimately
impacting consumers and firms and crowding out private consumption and investment. 
    The euro has weakened and become more correlated to BTP spreads, GS notes - though that
relationship has faded since the euro zone crisis, as you can see below:

    FRENCH PRIVATISATIONS: HOW'S SAFRAN AS A TASTER? (1050 GMT) 
    The French government's sale of €1.25 billion worth of Safran shares comes as a reminder
that 2019 may be quite a busy year for equity capital markets in France. 
    A press release by SocGen, which was happy to tell the world it acted as an advisor on the
placement, reminds investors that the privatisation of 2.34 percent of the French aerospace firm
was ""the largest ECM deal in France in 2018"".
    With Macron planning to finance a 10 billion euro innovation fund, there should be many more
big ECM deals coming, notably in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA>. 
    Here's the French state's €83 billion portfolio of listed companies (valued on September 4

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.
    ""Not many people like Trump for his views, but as a businessman he seems to be doing a
relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.
    ""What the market is looking for is to see further agreements with the EU, and the big prize
is a deal with China.""
    Here was ING forex analyst Viraj Patel's interpretation of the ""USMCA"". Our apologies if the
song is now stuck in your head.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this

 (Adds comment from finance ministers meeting)
    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy defied pressure from Brussels
and its euro zone partners on Tuesday to water down ambitious
budget plans, threatening to sue EU officials it said were to
blame for a deepening sell-off on Rome's financial markets.
    The government last week set a deficit target of 2.4 percent
of economic output for the next three years. 
    That tripling of its predecessor's goal by the EU's second
most indebted nation unnerved investors and prompted criticism
and calls for a rethink from the European Commission.
    ""We are not turning back from the 2.4 percent target... We
will not backtrack by a millimetre,"" Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime
minister and leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement,
said on RTL radio.
    As Italian bonds and banking shares sold off sharply, Di
Maio said there was ""no doubt"" the leaders of France and Germany
wanted the Italian government to fall, while one lawmaker
suggested the country would be better off without the euro.
    Euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg said
Italy, whose representative Giovanni Tria was a notable
absentee, needed to toe the fiscal line.
    ""The majority of the member states will clearly ask and
demand that these (EU budget) rules are observed,"" Austrian
minister Hartwig Loger, whose country holds the rotating EU
presidency, told a news conference.   
    European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said
the current draft appeared not to comply with the rules, though
Brussels was open to dialogue. 
    Italy's ruling coalition, which joined forces in June on
promises to slash taxes and boost welfare spending, directed
anger at Brussels. Its other deputy Prime Minister, right-wing
League leader Matteo Salvini, said it might seek compensation
from the EU over Italy's rising borrowing costs. 
    ""The words and the threats of Juncker and other high EU
bureaucrats continue to raise the spread (between Italian and
German bond yields). We are ready to seek damages from those who
want to harm Italy,"" Salvini said.
    Italian 10-year bond yields peaked at a 4-1/2-year high on
Tuesday and shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300> at a 19-month
low. Both assets later trimmed those losses. [nL8N1WI3WN]
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which emerged from its third international bailout as
recently as August.
    While the headline deficit of 2.4 percent that Italy is
proposing would be within the Commission's 3 percent limit,
under the current plan the structural - or underlying - deficit
would rise, which runs contrary to EU rules.
    The Commission is also concerned the proposal will increase
Italy's huge public debt, proportionally the EU's second highest
after Greece's. The government says the debt will fall as the
expansionary budget spurs economic growth.
    
    'STRICT WITH ITALY TO SAVE EURO'
    On Monday, Juncker said the EU must be ""strict"" with Italy
to avoid putting the euro project at risk.
    Salvini called that a ""threat"" that ""no-one in Italy is
taken in by"". He said the government's priority was to respond
to its citizens' needs and criticism of its budget ""will not
stop us.""
    The government's task is made harder by pressure on Italian
bonds, intensified when eurosceptic League lawmaker Claudio
Borghi said the country's economic situation would improve
outside the euro zone. [nL8N1WI11F] [nL8N1WI0ZH]
    Borghi did not suggest the government planned to drop the
euro, and Di Maio and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte later
reiterated that Rome has no intention of leaving either the euro
zone or the EU.
    ""The euro is our currency and for us it is unrenounceable,""
and declarations suggesting otherwise had nothing to do with
government policy, Conte said on Facebook.
    Di Maio said Rome's adversaries were hoping to use markets
to weaken the coalition, but their bid would fail because the
5-Star/League alliance was more united than ever.
    Economy Minister Tria, a moderating but seemingly
increasingly isolated voice in government who is a member of
neither party, left Luxembourg late on Monday for Rome to put
the finishing touches to the budget plan.
    The document is expected in coming days but could be
published as soon as Tuesday.

 (Recasts with Treasury bill auction)
    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Hungary sold 3-month Treasury
bill yields at a negative yield on Tuesday as market players
expect that the government might cut debt issuance in the rest
of the year and the Hungarian central bank keeps interest rates
low.
    Some central banks in the European Union's eastern wing,
also including Poland, have defied the trend led by the Federal
Reserve's interest rate hikes.
    The Hungarian central bank (NBH) revamped its toolkit last
month, saying that it was now prepared for tightening its policy
if inflation trends make it necessary.
    But it kept its dovish bias and held its main interest rate
at 0.9 percent, a record low and Central Europe's lowest level,
below 1.5 percent in Prague and Warsaw, and 2.5 percent in
Bucharest.
    The government debt agency AKK sold 3-month Treasury bills
worth 25 billion forints at an average yield of -0.05 percent at
an auction on Tuesday, a record low last touched in February.
<HU3MT=RR>  
    It did not increase its offer despite the low yield and a
huge demand worth 124 billion forints.
    ""Some market players were unable to reinvest their money
after a large expiry last week,"" one Budapest-based fixed income
trader said, adding that positioning for the end of the year may
have also increased demand.
    ""I do not think that next week's auction will be as robust
as this one,"" the trader said.
    Erste analyst Orsolya Nyeste said the AKK may be curbing its
issuance in order to keep the year-end level of state debt
lower, after increased sales in the past months as delay in
European Union funding inflows opened a wide gap in the state
budget.
    A eurobond issue last week and other sales have created a
big buffer to finance that gap, AKK chief executive Gyorgy
Barcza told Reuters on Monday. [nL8N1WH57J]
    After a rise in Czech interest rates in the past year,
Hungary is the only country in the region with negative
short-term interest rates.
    ""Fundamentals (trade and current account surpluses) make the
forint undervalued, but low interest rates mean it is unlikely
that it can strengthen,"" Nyeste said.
    The forint <EURHUF=> eased 0.1 percent against the euro to
323.35 by 1318 GMT.
    But it was off early lows at 324.10, and its fall was caused
by international factors rather than the low short-term market
interest rates, market participants said.
    Some Central European currencies and stocks eased on Tuesday
as comments from a senior Italian official fuelled worries over
the country's euro zone membership, sending jitters through
European markets. [nR1N1VZ00K] 
    The zloty <EURPLN=> eased a quarter of a percent to 4.2933
versus the euro, while the leu <EURRON=> shed 0.1 percent, to
trade at 4.6675, approaching the 3-month lows set last week.
    The Czech crown set a 2-month low early at 25.875 in the
session, before recovering to 25.8.

    FRANCE AND ITALY: THE MOTE AND THE BEAM PARABLE (1446 GMT) 
    Sarcasm is probably the best way to describe how a number of analysts saw French Finance
minister Le Maire remind Italy of its fiscal obligations last week. 
    The timing was bittersweet indeed and evoked the mote and the beam parable about how one
should judge others by the same standards one would like to be judged.     
    Bruno Le Maire declared ""all states have to do their best to stick to commitments"" just days
after news that France, itself a long-time infringer of EU budgetary rules, had seen its debt go
over 100 percent of GDP in 2017 because of a debt pile inherited from its national railways.
    ""A sense of French irony which our European neighbours might not get,"" tweeted Pictet
economist Frederik Ducrozet who then posted the following chart showing that Italy, unlike
France, can flash world markets a streak of primary surplus:
    
 
 
    
    Ducrozet has a point: the French deficit is expected to rise to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent
this year while Italy's 2.4 percent target has unleashed shockwaves across European bourses. 
    To rub salt into the Italian wound, one could also note that France's growth prospects are
fading faster than Italy's.  
    Of course one of the most obvious reasons for the market stress is that France's 100 percent
of GDP debt pile is well below Italy's 130 percent, even if both are handsomely above the 60
percent EU threshold. 
    ""One doesn't know the level at which public debt starts becoming harmful,"" notes Philippe
Waechter head of economic research at Ostrum Asset Management.
    ""I don't have the feeling that Japan is bankrupted, with 240 percent of debt-to-GDP"" he
adds, making the point there's no such thing as a magic number in this field.  
    True enough but with analysts asking whether we could be heading towards a ""Eurozone debt
crisis 2.0"", it's understandable that a lot of time is spent trying to identify the tipping
point between a brief market storm and a euro zone existential crisis.

    AFTERNOON SNAPSHOT: OFF LOWS (1325 GMT)
    Italian stocks <.FTMIB> and banks <.FTIT8300> have come well off earlier lows, while Europe
too has pared some of its earlier losses. There's still lot of stress on the market as
uncertainty over political risk in Italy looks here to stay but in the mix of political noise
there have been some less bearish headlines giving some support. 
    Here are a few:
    * PM Conte says euro is ""unrenounceable"" for Italy [nR1N1RB01S]
    * Italy's govt does not want to exit from the euro - Deputy PM [nR1N1VZ00N]
    * Italy has no plans to leave euro - League lawmaker Borghi  [nR1N1RB01P]

    In the snapshot you can see the move off this morning's lows for the STOXX <.STOXX> and the
FTSE MIB indexes.   
 
    Meanwhile, U.S. stocks futures are down as Italian jitters spread and relief from a reworked
NAFTA deal faded. [nL4N1WI2MJ]

    ITALY: ""A MACRO NO MAN'S LAND"" (1140 GMT)
    While Italian assets are recovering slightly from this morning's slide - the FTSE MIB is now
down 0.6 percent, in line with the STOXX 600 - most analysts remain pretty downbeat about the
prospects for the economy, with GS going so far as to call this a new regime.
    ""Italian spreads to Bunds have entered a new regime, a macro no man's land,"" write GS
analysts. ""In our view, the prices of Italian assets are likely to remain lower and more
volatile (even compared with current levels).""
    Ultimately, GS is ""sceptical"" that the fiscal easing proposed by the government will
stimulate real GDP growth to rates above its forecast, saying fiscal expansion in high debt
countries leads to widening spreads which in turn increase banks' cost of funding, ultimately
impacting consumers and firms and crowding out private consumption and investment. 
    The euro has weakened and become more correlated to BTP spreads, GS notes - though that
relationship has faded since the euro zone crisis, as you can see below:

    FRENCH PRIVATISATIONS: HOW'S SAFRAN AS A TASTER? (1050 GMT) 
    The French government's sale of €1.25 billion worth of Safran shares comes as a reminder
that 2019 may be quite a busy year for equity capital markets in France. 
    A press release by SocGen, which was happy to tell the world it acted as an advisor on the
placement, reminds investors that the privatisation of 2.34 percent of the French aerospace firm
was ""the largest ECM deal in France in 2018"".
    With Macron planning to finance a 10 billion euro innovation fund, there should be many more
big ECM deals coming, notably in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA>. 
    Here's the French state's €83 billion portfolio of listed companies (valued on September 4

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.
    ""Not many people like Trump for his views, but as a businessman he seems to be doing a
relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.
    ""What the market is looking for is to see further agreements with the EU, and the big prize
is a deal with China.""
    Here was ING forex analyst Viraj Patel's interpretation of the ""USMCA"". Our apologies if the
song is now stuck in your head.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

 (Adds detail on Boris Johnson, updates prices)
    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The pound slid to a three-week low
on Tuesday as a conflict over UK Prime Minister Theresa May's
Brexit plan escalated, with deep divisions on show at the ruling
Conservative Party's conference.
    Sterling's fortunes are being driven by headlines about
May's proposal for Britain exiting the European Union in six
months and whether she can persuade the block and senior members
of her own party to accept it.
    In particular, traders are focused on a new offer Britain is
preparing to make to the EU on the Irish border, aimed at
breaking the deadlock in Brexit talks before a decisive EU
summit in late October. [nL9N1VJ00D]
    At her party's annual conference this week, May is defending
her so-called Chequers plan for leaving the EU. But critics,
including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson are openly
defying her.
    Johnson, the figurehead for the campaign to leave the EU,
stopped short of an outright leadership bid to replace May in a
speech on Tuesday but tore into her Brexit blueprint.
[nL8N1WH6ZA]
    The pound did not budge in response.
    The currency spiked on Monday following a report that
Britain might back down on customs checks between mainland
Britain and Northern Ireland, a major obstacle to Brexit.
[nL9N1VJ00E]
    But, by 1445 GMT, sterling <GBP=D3> had relinquished all of
those gains and was trading down half a percent versus a
rallying dollar at $1.2979, its lowest since Sept. 10. It was
flat versus a weaker euro at 88.88 pence. <EURGBP=D3>
    The leader of the Northern Irish party which props up May's
government, Arlene Foster, said Northern Ireland must leave on
the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom. [nL9N1W7007]
    ""Foster saying we cannot be separated from the United
Kingdom is a reiteration of their position since the referendum
and the single most import feature in the whole Brexit
negotiation,"" Mizuho's head of FX hedge fund sales Neil Jones
said.
    A potential downside risk for sterling is the prospect of
May's own party challenging her leadership. 
    May said on Tuesday she planned to remain in the job ""for
the long term"" as she called on her party to back her plan for
Brexit. [nL9N1VJ00E]
    ""The conference is a minefield for sterling. We're trading
from headline to headline,"" WorldFirst head of FX strategy
Jeremy Cook said.
    ""The bias for the pound is to the downside,"" he said.
    May speaks at her party conference on Wednesday.

 (Adds further reaction)
    By Holger Hansen
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The German government presented a
plan on Tuesday to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by
offering owners trade-in incentives and hardware upgrades,
prompting swift objections from both the car industry and
environmental groups.
    After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders
of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of
Tuesday they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the
worst-affected German cities while avoiding unpopular driving
bans.
    Owners of millions of older diesel vehicles in Germany's 14
most polluted cities should be able to choose between trade-in
incentives and hardware fixes for their vehicles.
    Carmakers, however, did not commit to covering the cost of
retrofits, as the hardware fixes are known, which could run into
billions of euros. They said instead the focus should be on
encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for
cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at
discounted prices.
    The government cannot force the carmakers to pay for
hardware upgrades, but shares an interest with the industry in
preventing further driving bans for polluting cars, which have
already been imposed in Hamburg and planned for
Frankfurt.[nL3N1W54AN]
    On the other side of the argument, green groups argued that
the government should have been tougher on the industry, three
years after the ""dieselgate"" scandal broke out at Volkswagen.
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it cheated
U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel
vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution
limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory
crackdown.
    Environmental groups have been heartened by a court ruling
in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars.
    ""Driving bans will not be avoided with this double failure
to come up with a solution,"" said Juergen Resch, managing
director of environmental group DUH, noting upcoming rulings in
a number of major cities.
    
    RAISING OBJECTIONS
    Ministers were keen to trumpet a deal that they said would
mean a big investment by carmakers in getting drivers into
cleaner cars.
    ""We are talking about a significant billion (euro)
contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,""
Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said. [nS8N1W5028]
    German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that the car
industry should take the chance of avoiding driving bans.
    ""My impression is that the car industry has a big interest
in restoring the image of diesel,"" she said. 
    Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of
owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather
than a trade-in, and raised practical objections over the plan.
    Volkswagen said whether retrofits were possible would depend
on suppliers developing systems that were good enough, and it
did not commit to covering the cost of hardware upgrades.
    BMW <BMWG.DE> and PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> Opel unit have
rejected hardware retrofits altogether, with the latter arguing
they were economically not sensible and the technology not fully
developed. [nS8N1W402K]
    Costs for the industry could be as high as 12.5 billion
euros, estimated Stefan Bratzel, director of Germany's Center of
Automotive Management.
    ""If around 2.5 million vehicles take up retrofits or
trade-in incentives with costs between 2,500 and 5,000 euros,
the total cost would be between 6.3 and 12.5 billion euros,"" he
said.  
    There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4
standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5
million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from
the German KBA transport authority.
    Environmental group Greenpeace accused the industry of
exploiting the situation.
    ""The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on
emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that
will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,"" it
said.
    Klaus Mueller, head of Germany's Consumer Protection
Association told the Sueddeutsche newspaper that many customers
would not be able to afford to change their cars even with the
trade-in incentives.
    
    ""END OF ERA""
    The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older
Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is
Euro 6.
    France's Renault <RENA.PA> said earlier on Tuesday it was
offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives

    By William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Union
cannot be allowed to ""annex"" Northern Ireland by having it
accept different regulations than those that apply in the rest
of the United Kingdom, the leader of the province's Democratic
Unionist Party (DUP) said on Tuesday.
    The DUP's 10 lawmakers prop up British Prime Minister
Theresa May's minority Conservative government. Both May and the
DUP are committed to leaving the EU next year and to securing an
exit agreement that protects a 1998 peace deal that ended
decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
    However, Britain and the EU have yet to agree how to avoid a
'hard border' involving physical infrastructure such as customs
posts between Northern Ireland and the Irish Repbulic, an EU
member, after Brexit. The issue has stalled the exit talks and
increased fears that they could fail.
    ""Northern Ireland is not about to become a semi-detached
part of the United Kingdom,"" DUP leader Arlene Foster told a
meeting on Tuesday on the sidelines of the annual Conservative
Party conference in the English city of Birmingham.
    The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has previously
suggested keeping Northern Ireland inside the bloc's customs
union as a ""backstop"" solution, effectively creating a border
for goods in the Irish Sea between the province and Britain.
    ""Barnier cannot, cannot, annex off a part of the United
Kingdom so that he can say that that's the way to go forward. We
are not bluffing on this issue,"" Foster said.
    Foster's robust defence of the UK's territorial integrity is
largely echoed by May's government. But it comes as both Britain
and the EU are preparing concessions as part of what one British
official called ""a constructive dialogue"" that could yet lead to
a deal. [nL8N1WI2IL]
    Britain has promised to bring a new proposal to unlock the
standoff with Brussels, possibly by compromising about
regulatory controls on goods in exchange for Brussels embracing
the use of technological fixes for customs checks. [nL8N1WI2IL]
    However, Foster was unequivocal in rejecting any solution
that created a de facto border between Britain and Northern
Ireland.
    Asked if she could ever accept different regulation, even as
a last resort, Foster told Reuters: ""No. This argument was put
last year that the backstop really didn't mean anything and it
was just there as an insurance policy and now it has become the
whole focus of the negotiations. That sort of argument has gone
now.""
    Instead, Foster pushed for Brussels to widen the scope of
the technological fixes it was prepared to consider.
    Asked how the impasse would be resolved from here, she said:
""If the European Union are quite content to accept technology in
the Irish Sea, one has to ask the question why that doesn't work
then on the border (between the Irish Republic and Northern
Ireland).""

coalition to approve a scheme offering tax breaks to citizens
who buy government debt.
    The measure, put forward by members of the right-wing League
party, is aimed at helping the two-party coalition - which
includes the League - find extra resources to finance costly
measures it promised during campaigning for national elections
in March.
    Italy's debt already stands above 130 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, the highest in the euro zone
after Greece, and its ambitious budget plans have spooked
markets and set it on a collision course with EU authorities and
its euro zone partners. [nL8N1WI2PT]
    Armando Siri, Undersecretary for the Infrastructure Ministry
and League lawmaker, told Reuters the scheme envisaged up to 15
billion euros in investments in Treasury bonds and, if approved
in cabinet, would be included in a decree to be presented by
Oct. 20 alongside the 2019 budget.
    Italian families and businesses hold less than 5 percent of
the country's 2.3 trillion euro public debt, the bulk of which
is in the hands of banks and investment funds. 
    Another significant investor is the European Central Bank,
which is due to end purchase of Italian and other euro zone
sovereign debt under its stimulus programme at the end of this
year. 
    The finance ministry has expressed doubt over the legality
of a savings measure that would exclude European Union citizens,
a source close to the matter told Reuters.
    Siri said that the no EU rules would be breached since the
state would issued dedicated bonds for the new plan, adding
there would be a 3,000 euro ($3,470) per capita investment cap.

    NAVIGATING THE ITALIAN BANKS STORM (1525 GMT)
    In a bold comment, Morgan Stanley analysts say ""Italy's creditworthiness is now tied to the
Five Star and League party, in our economists' view.""
    So what does this mean for banks? The index <.FTIT8300> is still down 1 percent, having hit
a 19-month low in early trading.
    MS have cut their price targets on Italian banks by around 7 percent on average, and
increased their cost of equity by 1 percent to reflect a higher risk premium on these assets. 
    Here are some of their calculations and suggestions to guide investors through the daunting
seas of the Italian financials stocks:
    - Banco BPM, UBI Banca and Banca Monte dei Paschi are most vulnerable based on size of bond
portfolios and starting levels of CET1
    - ""We would avoid midcaps, even at current multiples""
    - They remove Unicredit from their ""EU most preferred"" list, adding Caixabank instead as a
more defensive peripheral play
    Overall, ""valuations don't yet look cheap enough to suggest that further 'bad news' is in
the price,"" they say. As you can see below valuations are certainly much lower than European
peers:

    FRANCE AND ITALY: THE MOTE AND THE BEAM PARABLE (1446 GMT) 
    Sarcasm is probably the best way to describe how a number of analysts saw French Finance
minister Le Maire remind Italy of its fiscal obligations last week. 
    The timing was bittersweet indeed and evoked the mote and the beam parable about how one
should judge others by the same standards one would like to be judged.     
    Bruno Le Maire declared ""all states have to do their best to stick to commitments"" just days
after news that France, itself a long-time infringer of EU budgetary rules, had seen its debt go
over 100 percent of GDP in 2017 because of a debt pile inherited from its national railways.
    ""A sense of French irony which our European neighbours might not get,"" tweeted Pictet
economist Frederik Ducrozet who then posted the following chart showing that Italy, unlike
France, can flash world markets a streak of primary surplus:
    
 
 
    
    Ducrozet has a point: the French deficit is expected to rise to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent
this year while Italy's 2.4 percent target has unleashed shockwaves across European bourses. 
    To rub salt into the Italian wound, one could also note that France's growth prospects are
fading faster than Italy's.  
    Of course one of the most obvious reasons for the market stress is that France's 100 percent
of GDP debt pile is well below Italy's 130 percent, even if both are handsomely above the 60
percent EU threshold. 
    ""One doesn't know the level at which public debt starts becoming harmful,"" notes Philippe
Waechter head of economic research at Ostrum Asset Management.
    ""I don't have the feeling that Japan is bankrupted, with 240 percent of debt-to-GDP"" he
adds, making the point there's no such thing as a magic number in this field.  
    True enough but with analysts asking whether we could be heading towards a ""Eurozone debt
crisis 2.0"", it's understandable that a lot of time is spent trying to identify the tipping
point between a brief market storm and a euro zone existential crisis.

    AFTERNOON SNAPSHOT: OFF LOWS (1325 GMT)
    Italian stocks <.FTMIB> and banks <.FTIT8300> have come well off earlier lows, while Europe
too has pared some of its earlier losses. There's still lot of stress on the market as
uncertainty over political risk in Italy looks here to stay but in the mix of political noise
there have been some less bearish headlines giving some support. 
    Here are a few:
    * PM Conte says euro is ""unrenounceable"" for Italy [nR1N1RB01S]
    * Italy's govt does not want to exit from the euro - Deputy PM [nR1N1VZ00N]
    * Italy has no plans to leave euro - League lawmaker Borghi  [nR1N1RB01P]

    In the snapshot you can see the move off this morning's lows for the STOXX <.STOXX> and the
FTSE MIB indexes.   
 
    Meanwhile, U.S. stocks futures are down as Italian jitters spread and relief from a reworked
NAFTA deal faded. [nL4N1WI2MJ]

    ITALY: ""A MACRO NO MAN'S LAND"" (1140 GMT)
    While Italian assets are recovering slightly from this morning's slide - the FTSE MIB is now
down 0.6 percent, in line with the STOXX 600 - most analysts remain pretty downbeat about the
prospects for the economy, with GS going so far as to call this a new regime.
    ""Italian spreads to Bunds have entered a new regime, a macro no man's land,"" write GS
analysts. ""In our view, the prices of Italian assets are likely to remain lower and more
volatile (even compared with current levels).""
    Ultimately, GS is ""sceptical"" that the fiscal easing proposed by the government will
stimulate real GDP growth to rates above its forecast, saying fiscal expansion in high debt
countries leads to widening spreads which in turn increase banks' cost of funding, ultimately
impacting consumers and firms and crowding out private consumption and investment. 
    The euro has weakened and become more correlated to BTP spreads, GS notes - though that
relationship has faded since the euro zone crisis, as you can see below:

    FRENCH PRIVATISATIONS: HOW'S SAFRAN AS A TASTER? (1050 GMT) 
    The French government's sale of €1.25 billion worth of Safran shares comes as a reminder
that 2019 may be quite a busy year for equity capital markets in France. 
    A press release by SocGen, which was happy to tell the world it acted as an advisor on the
placement, reminds investors that the privatisation of 2.34 percent of the French aerospace firm
was ""the largest ECM deal in France in 2018"".
    With Macron planning to finance a 10 billion euro innovation fund, there should be many more
big ECM deals coming, notably in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA>. 
    Here's the French state's €83 billion portfolio of listed companies (valued on September 4
by the French Finance Ministry):

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.
    ""Not many people like Trump for his views, but as a businessman he seems to be doing a
relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.
    ""What the market is looking for is to see further agreements with the EU, and the big prize
is a deal with China.""
    Here was ING forex analyst Viraj Patel's interpretation of the ""USMCA"". Our apologies if the
song is now stuck in your head.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    MORNING CALL: ITALY BUDGET WOES SET TO WEIGH ON EUROPEAN OPEN (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this

Investment Trust said on Tuesday it would fix exchange rates for
foreign currency rents at four of its commercial properties in
October, after Turkey banned real estate rent in foreign
currencies.
    Turkey ruled in September that property sales, rental
contracts and leasing transactions must be made in lira, halting
the use of foreign currencies for such deals in a fresh step to
support the ailing local currency.
    The currency has currently lost around 37 percent of its
value against the dollar this year on concerns over President
Tayyip Erdogan's grip on monetary policy and a diplomatic row
between Ankara and Washington.
    Dogus REIT <DGGYO.IS> said in a filing to the Istanbul
bourse that it would fix the euro exchange rate for October at
5.90 to the lira at two locations and 4.9 lira to the dollar at
the other two.
    The trust is the real estate arm of Dogus Holding
<DOGUS.UL>, which operates in construction, energy, media,
tourism and automobiles, where it is the sole Turkish importer
and distributor for Volkswagen <VOWG.DE>.
    Reasons for the decision were demands from the tenants with
""narrowed business volumes"" and the negative effects of exchange
rates, Dogus said.
    It added that it was expecting an announcement from the
Treasury and Finance Ministry regarding cases that would be
considered exceptions to the new rent regulations.

    LILLE, France/PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - French police raided
a Shi'ite Muslim faith centre and arrested three of its leaders
for illegal weapons possession in pre-dawn swoops on Tuesday
that government officials said were prompted by suspicion of
links to terrorist organisations. 
    France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community, remains
on maximum alert after attacks in recent years in which Islamist
militants and people inspired by radical groups such as Islamic
State have killed close to 250 people.
    Paris also accused Tehran on Tuesday of plotting to bomb an
opposition rally in Paris earlier this year. [ID:nL8N1WI2LU]   
    Some 200 police officers including elite troopers from Paris
took part in raids that began under darkness at the Centre Zahra
France and homes of a dozen of its members, in Grande Synthe
near the northern port town of Dunkirk.
    ""This is a counter-terrorism operation,"" the local prefect's
office said a statement.
    ""The activities of Centre Zahra France are under
particularly close watch given its leaders' clear support for
several terrorist organisations and movements espousing ideas
contrary to (French) republican values.""
    Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said three people were put
in custody after the discovery of illegal arms, and that a
prayer room was being shut.
    The raids coincided with an announcement that France had
also seized assets belonging to Iran's intelligence services and
two Iranian nationals over a June plot to attack an exiled
Iranian opposition group's rally outside Paris. [nL8N1WI2L2]
    Two sources said there was no direct link between the raids
and the Iranian intelligence asset freezes.
    However, a French diplomatic source said that while the two
incidents were not linked, the raid on the Zahra aimed to show
that Paris would also not tolerate radical Shi'ite groups.
    It's not linked ... but we will not accept any form of
terrorism or incitement of terrorism on our national territory,""
the source said.
    ""The Zahra centre is not an official Iranian entity, but it
is a centre of influence with typical Shi'ite messages and which
propagates radical messages including by bringing closer
together movements that we deem unacceptable ... it is a centre
of Shi'ite interference."" 
    Assets of the Centre Zahra France were frozen too, along
with financial assets held under other names, on orders issued
by France's interior and finance ministry, a notice published in
the official government journal of legal acts said.  
    The centre's website says it has some 8,000  ""followers"" on
social network sites and its goal is to spread the message of
Islam via film, radio, writings and conferences. It also offers
a contact point on social, family and religious matters.
    France, which is historically a predominantly Roman Catholic
country, is officially secular, with separation by law between
matters of state and religion for over a century. It is home to
five million or more Muslims out of a population of 67 million.

it sets its monetary policy even if financial stability is at
stake, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on
Tuesday.
    Villeroy, who is also governor of the French central bank,
did not single out Italy, but Rome's decision to ditch previous

assets under pressure, raising financial stability questions.

    He added that ECB policymakers' primary mandate was to
guarantee price stability in the euro zone and that financial
stability had to be ensured through regulatory measures.

 (Adds Daimler, BMW responses)
    By Holger Hansen
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The German government presented
plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers
to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes,
prompting objections from environmental groups and grudging
concessions from the industry.
    After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders
of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of
Tuesday they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the
worst-affected German cities while avoiding unpopular driving
bans.
    Owners of millions of older diesel vehicles in Germany's 14
most polluted cities should be able to choose between trade-in
sweeteners and hardware upgrades for their vehicles.
    Carmakers, however, did not all commit to covering the cost
of retrofits, as the hardware fixes are known, which could run
into billions of euros.
    They said instead the focus should be on encouraging car
owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner
vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at
discounted prices.
    Daimler <DAIGn.DE> gave arguably the strongest backing,
saying it was prepared to participate in the retrofit programme
and offering incentives of up to 10,000 euros ($11,564) for
those swapping old cars for new Mercedes models.
    ""We are convinced that emissions of nitrogen oxide can be
controlled in cities with modern diesel and without driving
bans,"" said Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche, referring to diesel
byproducts that can cause respiratory ailments.
    BMW also said it would offer a trade-in incentive of 6,000
euros in the most polluted parts of the country.
    France's Renault <RENA.PA> said earlier on Tuesday it was
offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives
of up to 10,000 euros if they bought new cars. [nS8N1VX02H]
    
    OBJECTIONS
    However, the chief executive of France's PSA Group <PEUP.PA>
said the retrofit approach ""doesn't work"", although the trade-in
approach was more viable.
    ""Who's going to pay is not clear. We believe it's not the
carmakers' responsibility because at the time when those cars
were sold they met all legal requirements,"" Carlos Tavares told
Reuters at the Paris Motor Show.  
    The government cannot force the carmakers to pay for
hardware upgrades, but shares an interest with the industry in
preventing further driving bans for polluting cars, which have
already been imposed in Hamburg and are planned for Frankfurt
and Stuttgart, the home of Germany's car industry. [nL3N1W54AN]
    On the other side of the argument, green groups argued that
the government should have been tougher on the industry, three
years after the ""dieselgate"" scandal broke out at Volkswagen.
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it cheated
U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel
vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution
limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory
crackdown.
    Environmental groups have been heartened by a court ruling
in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars.
    ""Driving bans will not be avoided with this double failure
to come up with a solution,"" said Juergen Resch, managing
director of environmental group DUH, noting upcoming rulings in
a number of major cities.
    
    BIG INVESTMENT
    Ministers were keen to trumpet a deal that they said would
mean a big investment by carmakers in getting drivers into
cleaner cars.
    ""We are talking about a significant billion (euro)
contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,""
Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said. [nS8N1W5028]
    German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that the car
industry should take the chance of avoiding driving bans.
    ""My impression is that the car industry has a big interest
in restoring the image of diesel,"" she said. 
    Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of
owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather
than a trade-in, and raised practical objections over the plan.
    Volkswagen said whether retrofits were possible would depend
on suppliers developing systems that were good enough, and it
did not commit to covering the cost of hardware upgrades.
    Costs for the industry could be as high as 12.5 billion
euros, estimated Stefan Bratzel, director of Germany's Center of
Automotive Management.
    ""If around 2.5 million vehicles take up retrofits or
trade-in incentives with costs between 2,500 and 5,000 euros,
the total cost would be between 6.3 and 12.5 billion euros,"" he
said.  
    There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4
standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5
million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from
the German KBA transport authority.
    
    END OF THE ROAD?
    Environmental group Greenpeace accused the industry of
exploiting the situation.
    ""The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on
emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that
will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,"" it
said.
    Klaus Mueller, head of Germany's Consumer Protection
Association told the Sueddeutsche newspaper that many customers
would not be able to afford to change their cars even with the
trade-in incentives.
    The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older
Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is
Euro 6.
    Some leading figures in the industry saw diesel vehicles
being phased out over time. 
    ""We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,"" Renault
Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris
auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight. [nL8N1WH5YT]
    ""It’s the end of the game,"" he added.

Minister Theresa May said she had not watched a speech on
Tuesday by her former foreign minister Boris Johnson, preferring
instead to talk about her party that she described as being in

    To standing ovations, cheers and laughter, Johnson, May's
most powerful critic in her party, said in his speech her
so-called Chequers plan to leave the European Union was a
""cheat.""
    Asked whether she was cross with Johnson, who stole the show

I'm cross about ... He wants to tear up our guarantee to the
people of Northern Ireland.""

    By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - British shares retreated on
Tuesday as the positive impact of a new North American free
trade pact faded globally and shares of Royal Mail <RMG.L> hit a
record low the day after the 500-year-old postal service issued
a profit warning.
    The top FTSE 100 <.FTSE> index fell 0.3 percent to 7,474.55
points, outperforming continental indices hit by concerns over
Italy's 2019 budget though British bank stocks were impacted.
[.EU]
    The exporter-heavy index did not enjoy the usual accounting
boost from the pound falling to a three-week low, with investors
 anxious about infighting in the ruling Conservative party over
Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. [nL8N1WI1M8] 
    The biggest weight was Royal Mail <RMG.L>, which lost 8.4
percent to close at 358.6p, its lowest level since listing.
    ""We have been bearish on the outlook for productivity
improvements, but yesterday's profit warning was shocking in its
scale and timing,"" Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said. 
    Shares of the company, founded under Henry VIII, plunged 18
percent on Monday after it warned its shareholders annual
profits would be far lower than expected, hurt by eroding
logistics business margins and weaker letter volumes.
[nL4N1WI1O5]
    Ferguson <FERG.L> was another big loser, tumbling 6.8
percent after the distributor of plumbing and heating products
said organic revenue growth in September fell and warned of
challenging UK markets. [nL4N1WI1EW]
    ""The U.S. still powers ahead but results are 'only' in line
and there is no buyback today - is it enough to drive further
outperformance?"" wrote UBS analysts. 
    Financials were the biggest drag on the FTSE 100, taking
17.7 points off the index and tracking a slide in bank stocks
across the European region triggered by anti-euro comments from
an Italian lawmaker. 
    The market remains sensitive to any signs of Italy's new
populist government causing the next existential challenge to
the euro zone as the EU grapples with fraught Brexit
negotiations.
    Uncertainty was still palpable in the travel sector after
Ryanair's <RYA.L> profit warning on Monday. 
    Easyjet <EZL.L> was down 1.4 percent after its prospects
were cut by brokers.
    Miners were the top boost to the index with Randgold
Resources <RRS.L>, Evraz <EVRE.L>, and BHP Billiton <BLT.L> up
1.7 to 1.8 percent as zinc hit its highest in nearly two months
on falling stockpiles and rising Chinese premiums. [nL8N1WI3QP]
    ""Physical metal strength in China likely to spread to
ex-China and LME this autumn,"" said Goldman Sachs analysts.

    By Gabriela Baczynska and Elizabeth Piper
    BRUSSELS/BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) -
"" Unworkable"", ""unacceptable"", ""impasse"" - the words used to
describe Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union do
little to temper concerns that the two are heading for a chaotic
divorce.
    But behind the scenes, both sides are preparing concessions
as part of what one British official called ""a constructive
dialogue"" that could yet lead to a deal.
    Officials and sources on both sides say there is a clear
will to try to overcome the obstacles to winning a withdrawal
deal and agreeing a framework for future ties - a deal on the
Northern Ireland border and EU-UK trade.
    The EU will start putting in writing its offer for future
trade ties, as Britain has pressed for after feeling Prime
Minister Theresa May was snubbed at talks in Austria last month.
    The official agenda of the bloc's executive Commission,
published on Tuesday, shows it will discuss an ""outline of a new
partnership with the United Kingdom"" on Oct. 10.     
    Britain has promised to bring a new proposal to unlock a
standoff over preventing the return of border checks between the
British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland,
possibly by compromising about regulatory controls on goods in
exchange for Brussels embracing the use of technological fixes
for customs checks. 
    With only six months to go before Britain leaves the bloc,
the lack of clarity over the divorce has spooked markets fearful
of a no-deal Brexit, which both sides say they are working to
avoid.
    On Wednesday, May gives a speech to end a fractious annual
conference of her Conservative Party, where Brexit rebels have
done much to undermine her stance of maintaining close ties with
the EU.
    On Thursday, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar will be
in Brussels for talks with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel
Barnier.
    Senior diplomats in Brussels have been summoned to a Brexit
meeting on Friday and Barnier will present an initial draft of
the bloc's trade proposal soon after, which the EU hopes will
woo Britain into compromises. 
    No new dates have been confirmed for the next round of
negotiations between Barnier and British Brexit minister Dominic
Raab, but several EU diplomats said they expected them to take
place in Brussels next week. 
    
    TIGHT SCHEDULE
    ""It must be next week or it's too late to get anything done
within our six-week schedule,"" one said, referring to a plan to
have a preliminary Brexit deal at the next EU leaders' summit on
Oct. 18. 
    The remaining 27 EU states are due to host a summit on Nov.
17-18 to sign off on any agreement with Britain. Otherwise, they
will switch to contingency mode to prepare for a no-deal Brexit
in which Britain leaves next March with no agreements in place
to mitigate the economic shock.
    British officials have signalled new ideas will come. A
focus will be attempts to come to agreement over customs
arrangements on the island of Ireland to prevent the emergence
of a ""hard border"", which inflamed sectarian conflict in the
past.
    Raab said at the Conservative conference he welcomed
Barnier's suggestion that technology could be used to help
resolve the issue, after London said it could not accept the
bloc's proposal for Northern Ireland to effectively stay in the
EU's customs union.
    He also said Britain was looking at how regulatory checks on
some goods could be used as part of a solution to move talks
forward.
    Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, on whose
support May relies to govern, swiftly said it would not accept
different regulations to the rest of the UK after
Brexit.[nL8N1WI4KH]
    Brussels dismissed a fix proposed by London in June. EU
diplomats stressed they have not yet seen the new British plan.

    NAVIGATING THE ITALIAN BANKS STORM (1525 GMT)
    In a bold comment, Morgan Stanley analysts say ""Italy's creditworthiness is now tied to the
Five Star and League party, in our economists' view.""
    So what does this mean for banks? The index <.FTIT8300> is still down 1 percent, having hit
a 19-month low in early trading.
    MS have cut their price targets on Italian banks by around 7 percent on average, and
increased their cost of equity by 1 percent to reflect a higher risk premium on these assets. 
    Here are some of their calculations and suggestions to guide investors through the daunting
seas of the Italian financials stocks:
    - Banco BPM, UBI Banca and Banca Monte dei Paschi are most vulnerable based on size of bond
portfolios and starting levels of CET1
    - ""We would avoid midcaps, even at current multiples""
    - They remove Unicredit from their ""EU most preferred"" list, adding Caixabank instead as a
more defensive peripheral play
    Overall, ""valuations don't yet look cheap enough to suggest that further 'bad news' is in
the price,"" they say. As you can see below valuations are certainly much lower than European
peers:

    FRANCE AND ITALY: THE MOTE AND THE BEAM PARABLE (1446 GMT) 
    Sarcasm is probably the best way to describe how a number of analysts saw French Finance
minister Le Maire remind Italy of its fiscal obligations last week. 
    The timing was bittersweet indeed and evoked the mote and the beam parable about how one
should judge others by the same standards one would like to be judged.     
    Bruno Le Maire declared ""all states have to do their best to stick to commitments"" just days
after news that France, itself a long-time infringer of EU budgetary rules, had seen its debt go
over 100 percent of GDP in 2017 because of a debt pile inherited from its national railways.
    ""A sense of French irony which our European neighbours might not get,"" tweeted Pictet
economist Frederik Ducrozet who then posted the following chart showing that Italy, unlike
France, can flash world markets a streak of primary surplus:
    
 
 
    
    Ducrozet has a point: the French deficit is expected to rise to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent
this year while Italy's 2.4 percent target has unleashed shockwaves across European bourses. 
    To rub salt into the Italian wound, one could also note that France's growth prospects are
fading faster than Italy's.  
    Of course one of the most obvious reasons for the market stress is that France's 100 percent
of GDP debt pile is well below Italy's 130 percent, even if both are handsomely above the 60
percent EU threshold. 
    ""One doesn't know the level at which public debt starts becoming harmful,"" notes Philippe
Waechter head of economic research at Ostrum Asset Management.
    ""I don't have the feeling that Japan is bankrupted, with 240 percent of debt-to-GDP"" he
adds, making the point there's no such thing as a magic number in this field.  
    True enough but with analysts asking whether we could be heading towards a ""Eurozone debt
crisis 2.0"", it's understandable that a lot of time is spent trying to identify the tipping
point between a brief market storm and a euro zone existential crisis.

    AFTERNOON SNAPSHOT: OFF LOWS (1325 GMT)
    Italian stocks <.FTMIB> and banks <.FTIT8300> have come well off earlier lows, while Europe
too has pared some of its earlier losses. There's still lot of stress on the market as
uncertainty over political risk in Italy looks here to stay but in the mix of political noise
there have been some less bearish headlines giving some support. 
    Here are a few:
    * PM Conte says euro is ""unrenounceable"" for Italy [nR1N1RB01S]
    * Italy's govt does not want to exit from the euro - Deputy PM [nR1N1VZ00N]
    * Italy has no plans to leave euro - League lawmaker Borghi  [nR1N1RB01P]

    In the snapshot you can see the move off this morning's lows for the STOXX <.STOXX> and the
FTSE MIB indexes.   
 
    Meanwhile, U.S. stocks futures are down as Italian jitters spread and relief from a reworked
NAFTA deal faded. [nL4N1WI2MJ]

    ITALY: ""A MACRO NO MAN'S LAND"" (1140 GMT)
    While Italian assets are recovering slightly from this morning's slide - the FTSE MIB is now
down 0.6 percent, in line with the STOXX 600 - most analysts remain pretty downbeat about the
prospects for the economy, with GS going so far as to call this a new regime.
    ""Italian spreads to Bunds have entered a new regime, a macro no man's land,"" write GS
analysts. ""In our view, the prices of Italian assets are likely to remain lower and more
volatile (even compared with current levels).""
    Ultimately, GS is ""sceptical"" that the fiscal easing proposed by the government will
stimulate real GDP growth to rates above its forecast, saying fiscal expansion in high debt
countries leads to widening spreads which in turn increase banks' cost of funding, ultimately
impacting consumers and firms and crowding out private consumption and investment. 
    The euro has weakened and become more correlated to BTP spreads, GS notes - though that
relationship has faded since the euro zone crisis, as you can see below:

    FRENCH PRIVATISATIONS: HOW'S SAFRAN AS A TASTER? (1050 GMT) 
    The French government's sale of €1.25 billion worth of Safran shares comes as a reminder
that 2019 may be quite a busy year for equity capital markets in France. 
    A press release by SocGen, which was happy to tell the world it acted as an advisor on the
placement, reminds investors that the privatisation of 2.34 percent of the French aerospace firm
was ""the largest ECM deal in France in 2018"".
    With Macron planning to finance a 10 billion euro innovation fund, there should be many more
big ECM deals coming, notably in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA>. 
    Here's the French state's €83 billion portfolio of listed companies (valued on September 4
by the French Finance Ministry):

    THE NOT-NAFTA DEAL - NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? (0950 GMT)
    The rebranded USMCA deal, apart from providing a springboard for many a Village People joke,
hasn't been earth-shattering for markets.
    ""The economic implications are little to none,"" says UBS chief economist Paul Donovan.
""Not-NAFTA looks a lot like NAFTA. What the deal does do is reduce the risks to financial
markets of trade being disrupted.""
    Yesterday's boost to risk appetite was pretty short-lived and investors today are focusing
back on Italian risks and weak PMI figures from China which dented sentiment in Asia.
    After all, this is just one small step in the bigger trade story.

relatively good job,"" says David Keir, manager of the global income and growth fund at Saracen.

    WANNA PLAY BREXIT? (0924 GMT)
    Let's forget Italy for a moment and turn to Britain.
    Natixis equity derivatives strategists Eric Benoist and Sav Vedi liken the drama around
Brexit to ""a power struggle of Shakespearean proportions"" and look at the rationale for a long
positioning in UKX volatility.
    ""As we approach the withdrawal deadline, we expect asset prices to become increasingly
volatile to news flow. The increased uncertainty surrounding the nature of Brexit has
historically manifested in pound volatility and weakness. We expect the GBP to remain volatile.
However, we do not see the FTSE 100 (UKX) volatility being dampened by that effect, as GBPUSD
and UKX correlation picks up,"" they say.
    ""Contrarily, we expect UK assets to face turbulent times, and we postulate it may be
appropriate to position now for higher UKX equity volatility,"" they conclude. 
    The UKX 12-month ATM implied volatility is trading about 1 standard deviation from its
5-year mean, and strategists at the French bank say that is an interesting entry point.    
 
    And here is Shakespeare, in a First Folio discovered nearly 400 years after his death.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN STRESS SPREADS (0855 GMT)
    A war of words between European officials and the Italian government is fuelling worries
that the euro zone may be heading into a crisis and while that is hitting hard Italian assets,
the rest of Europe is feeling the pain too.
    ""Italy remains front and centre for investors in Europe as tensions between Rome and
Brussels seem to be mounting,"" says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
    ""Talk of a fresh crisis seems overblown at present, but it does look as though the EU and
the Italian government are set for a major clash that will have far-reaching ramifications for
the EU and the Italian economy, even if it does look rather like markets are getting overly
twitchy over a couple of percentage points in the deficit,"" he adds.
    As you can see in the snapshot no European benchmark is trading in positive territory,
although selling pressure appears to have eased somewhat, as the economics spokesman of the
right-wing League, Claudio Borghi, sought to clarify his earlier remarks which spooked investors
by saying: ""Leaving the euro is not in the government's programme and it has no plans to do so"".

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0652 GMT)
    Weak Chinese manufacturing sector surveys [nL4N1WG0PZ] and fresh anti-euro rhetoric in Italy
from the head of the lower house's budget committee [nR1N1VZ00K] are set to weigh on European
shares at the open with stock index futures trading down as much as 0.7 percent.    
 
    Besides the sovereign stress on Italian banks, which could drag euro zone banks lower, UK
housebuilers will be in focus after data showed house prices rose 2% in September, topping
expectations, and ahead of the construction PMI for the same month which is expected to have
remained constant. The sector was hit yesterday by worries over plans to levy an extra fee on
foreign buyers of homes.
    On the corporate front, Akzo Nobel is on the watchlist after the Dutch paintmaker said it
would return 5.5 billion euros to shareholders, fulfilling a promise to give shareholders the
large majority of proceeds from the sale of its specialty chemicals unit. 
    Some minor dealmaking could also impact share prices with Veolia raising 340 mln euros from
the sale of its transport unit, and France cutting down its stake in aerospace firm Safran. 
    Eyes also on the auto sector and possible comments on the outlook for global trade, electric
cars and diesel costs on the first press day of the Paris auto show.

    MORNING CALL: ITALY BUDGET WOES SET TO WEIGH ON EUROPEAN OPEN (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open lower today following losses in Asia and as investors
remain cautious following the Italian government decision to raise its budget deficit target,
breaching EU rules. 
    ""This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this
morning with a lower open expected,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
    Yesterday, top euro zone officials warned Italy that its plan to borrow billions of extra

DAX to open 57 points lower at 12,282 and Paris' CAC to open 21 points lower at 5,486.
    Over in Asia, stocks fell as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free
trade deal faded, with cautious views on the global economy curbing risk sentiment. [nL4N1WI0IR]

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 02: Weaker operating conditions for various UK 
retailers have not translated into declining credit quality for Fitch-rated UK 
retail CMBS, which are almost entirely secured on four ""destination"" malls. But 
the challenges facing the sector and the growing use of company voluntary 
arrangements (CVAs) will be felt throughout UK retail property. 

Growing online penetration and higher import and wage costs have led to store 
and retail warehouse closures. Closures reflect location-specific factors, such 
as trading conditions and business rates. But certain larger malls which have 
bundled entertainment, leisure, and shopping appear relatively resilient. 

CVA proposals suggest that by becoming destinations in their own right, these 
malls have preserved the value of tenancies for retailers that are struggling in 
other locations. This is seen in the performance of the four malls supporting 
Fitch-rated CMBS: Meadowhall, Metrocentre, The Trafford Centre and Westfield 
Stratford City. Around 3.5% of aggregate contracted income comes from tenants 
that are subject to CVAs, or from House of Fraser (HoF), which was bought out of 
administration in August. But the contracted income actually lost is less than 
0.2% in aggregate, with Westfield Stratford City losing none. 

New Look has a significant presence in all four destination malls, with annual 
rent on its core brand totalling just over GBP6.75 million. But it has not 
sought to alter those stores' leases, other than by making monthly rather than 
quarterly payments over the next three years. Similarly, HoF's CVA proposal from 
before it went into administration suggests either little concern over 
underlying trading for its stores (at Meadowhall and Metrocentre), or that they 
act as loss-leaders. We expect HoF to maintain occupancy, although rent 
reductions are conceivable. 

Destination malls are not immune to sector pressures. Debt-relief proposals in 
CVAs that relate to landlords take two main forms: exiting lease contracts and 
vacating stores, or reducing rent. Voting weights mean landlords have less power 
to oppose CVA proposals than other creditors. In The Trafford Centre and 
Metrocentre, rent reductions of over 50% have been secured by New Look for its 
Men-branded stores, although this represents under 0.2% of mall income. 

Landlords can react to CVAs by terminating leases. They have six months to weigh 
up the costs of evicting tenants - in terms of void periods, marketing expenses 
and tenant incentives - against potential benefits from reconfiguring vacated 
units to boost occupational appeal. In a weakening rental market these benefits 
are restricted to the best locations. 

However, landlords cannot recover security of income lost from longer leases 
affected by CVAs, which is negative for all retail property valuations. Case law 
is still evolving in this area, and some retailers will be mindful of their 
reputation as reliable tenants in future lease negotiations, but we expect CVAs 
to continue to be used for some time. 

CVAs enable distressed retailers' pain to be shared more fully and more quickly 
with landlords, but also put competitor retailers at a disadvantage. This is 
already changing the leasing landscape, with press reports in May stating that 
Next was seeking ""CVA clauses"" in some leases to share in competitor rental 
discounts. Highly turnover-based leases may also become a feature of retail 
rentals. 

We expect landlords to resist lease forms that weaken security of income, and 
""CVA clauses"" and heavily turnover-based leases may be confined initially to 
weak locations or very strong retailers. But over time, these lease forms could 
become the least bad option for landlords defending occupancy rates from further 
advances in online shopping. 

UK retail property will be among the topics discussed at Fitch's event ""European 
Structured Finance: Risks to Watch in a Post QE World"" in London this Thursday.

 (Adds quotes from Strickland presser, comment on gender issue)
    By Niklas Pollard and Ben Hirschler
    STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - A trio of American,
French and Canadian scientists won the 2018 Nobel Prize for
Physics on Tuesday for breakthroughs in laser technology that
have turned light beams into precision tools for everything from
eye surgery to micro-machining.
    They include the first female physics prize winner in 55
years.
    Canada's Donna Strickland, of the University of Waterloo,
becomes only the third woman to win a Nobel for physics, after
Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963.
    Arthur Ashkin of Bell Laboratories in the United States won
half of the 2018 prize for inventing ""optical tweezers"", while
Strickland shared the remainder with Frenchman Gerard Mourou,
who also has U.S. citizenship, for work on high-intensity
lasers.
    ""Obviously we need to celebrate women physicists,""
Strickland said shortly after learning of the prize. 
    The Nobel prizes have long been dominated by male
scientists, and none more so than physics.
    Strickland is the first female Nobel laureate in any field
in three years. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said last
year it would seek to more actively encourage nominations of
women researchers to begin addressing the imbalance.
    Strickland later spoke of how her predecessor, Goeppert
Mayer, had been ""allowed to follow her husband from job to job
while he ... went up the ranks as a professor"", while she was
only allowed to teach or do unpaid research. 
    ""Women have come a long way,"" she told a news conference in
Canada.
    Her win comes a day after Europe's physics research centre
CERN suspended an Italian scientist, Alessandro Strumia, for
telling a seminar at the organisation's Swiss headquarters last
week that physics was ""invented and built by men"" and that women
were now being favoured in hiring for research positions.
    Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was
at the CERN event and unhappy about Strumia's comments, said
having a female Nobel winner was also important given the
current fight over U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh,
who is facing sexual misconduct allegations.
    ""This news could not come at a better time,"" Wade told
Reuters. ""After a week where a woman has been forced to describe
her sexual assault to a live television audience of billions,
and an academic at a prestigious university has said that women
are unfairly promoted into senior positions in physics, even I –
the eternal optimist – was starting to lose hope.""
    
    
    PRECISION INSTRUMENTS
    The inventions by the three scientists awarded this year's
Nobel Prize for Physics date back to the mid-1980s and over the
years they have revolutionised laser physics.
    ""Advanced precision instruments are opening up unexplored
areas of research and a multitude of industrial and medical
applications,"" the academy said on awarding the nine million
Swedish crown ($1 million) prize.
    Ashkin's work was based on the realisation that the pressure
of a beam of light could push microscopic objects and trap them
in position. A breakthrough came in 1987, when he used the new
optical tweezers to grab living bacteria without harming them.
    At 96, Ashkin is the oldest ever Nobel prize winner, but he
is still busy with fresh research.
    ""I am busy working right now, writing an important paper on
solar energy,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    ""I'm surprised,"" Ashkin said about winning the prize. ""A guy
called me up on the phone and woke me up.""
    Mourou and Strickland's research centred on developing the
most intense laser pulses ever created by humans, paving the way
for the precision instruments used today in corrective eye
surgery and industrial applications.
    The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace
have been awarded since 1901 in accordance with the will of
Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, whose discovery of
dynamite generated a vast fortune used to fund the prize.
    Physics is the second of this year's crop of prizes and
comes after the medicine prize was awarded on Monday for 
discoveries about how to harness and manipulate the immune
system to fight cancer. [nL8N1WH2I4]
    However, for the first time in decades no Nobel Prize for
literature will be given this year after a scandal over sexual
misconduct allegations saw a string of members leave the board
of the Swedish Academy that awards it. [nL8N1WH2IO]

    By Peter Apps
    Oct 2 (Reuters) - If Britain genuinely wanted a good
last-minute Brexit deal, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should
probably not have compared the European Union to the USSR.
    His comments, at the autumn conference of Prime Minister
Theresa May’s ruling Conservative Party on Monday, sparked
predictable outrage from other European leaders. That was
probably his intention: Hunt is one of several seen positioning
to run for party leadership. Like his predecessor Boris Johnson
and Donald Trump before him, Hunt looks to have calculated that
outrageous language grabs attention and internal party support,
even if it makes what the government needs to do increasingly
impossible.
    Almost everywhere one looks in Western politics this autumn,
one finds ambitious politicians deliberately frustrating
policymaking in the hope of personal or partisan gain. You see
it in the rise of the far right in Germany, Austria and Sweden,
the politicking around refugees in Italy and, of course, in the
U.S. Congress. Weaponizing fear, outrage, and most of all
division, they are likely betting crisis or confrontation will
win them the support of narrow but powerful factions and
electorates, either handing them new power or entrenching their
authority.
    The problem is that they are very rarely good at it. Staying
ahead of the maelstrom of political news, geopolitics, and the
machinations of their rivals means such plans seldom work out as
expected. Nowhere is this more true than over Brexit – and it is
sending the country stumbling perhaps irrevocably to a chaotic
“no deal” outcome that will likely usher in further instability.
    Only a few weeks ago, Britain’s exit looked like it would be
a relatively moderate affair, shaped by a series of compromises
brokered by the prime minister with the cabinet at her Chequers
country residence in July. That deal, however, has now been
rejected both by much of her own party and then European leaders
last month in Salzburg. This week, May and her party appear to
be moving towards a much harder break, perhaps no deal at all.
    That scenario, with all its implications for disruption of
borders, markets and supplies is already doing Britain serious
economic harm. One report estimated the country is now losing
500 million pounds a week in economic activity. So great is the
uncertainty, however, that this damage is likely to escalate
rapidly.
    Within the next year, it is entirely plausible that Britain
will have a Eurosceptic conservative government slashing taxes
and spending in the hope of creating a right-wing
Singapore-style haven. Or a snap election could usher in the
opposition Labour Party on exactly the opposite platform,
raising taxes on the rich and major firms to fund dramatic
public sector investment. Calls are growing for a second
referendum – but how that would work is very far from clear.
    Some suggest a new vote should provide the choice between a
chaotic “no deal” Brexit and something much more moderate,
perhaps adopting a Norway- or Switzerland-like position outside
the European Union, but closely linked to its nations and
systems. Others argue that abandoning Brexit altogether and
simply staying in must also be on the ballot. There have been
few realistic suggestions as to how those three options could be
offered without multiple rounds of voting. And at the time of
such unpredictability, finding consensus seems to be becoming
ever harder.
    It shouldn’t be a surprise that this is now damaging not
just Britain’s national reputation, but real people’s lives.
When one of my personal care assistants unexpectedly quit last
month, I phoned one of my regular care agencies for a
replacement. They had no one, they said – the young foreign
workers who have provided the backbone of support since my
injury 12 years ago were simply no longer coming.
    I found an alternative privately, but this dynamic is now
already rippling through business, agriculture, hospitality,
healthcare and most other sections of the economy. On Tuesday,
Home Secretary Sajid Javid outlined Britain’s latest thinking on
post-Brexit immigration policy, setting new limits to prioritize
skilled labor. What happens to the unskilled pool on which much
of the economy depends has still not been announced – once
again, short-term political aims appear to be driving wider
policy.
    How dangerous all this is depends on how you measure it. In
some ways, what is happening in Britain – while deeply
unpredictable – is less alarming than the trends in other
European countries, where far-right parties continue to grow,
supplanting a mainstream now struggling to defend even the basic
tenets of multicultural and open societies. Britain has been
protected from that by the resilience of its two-party-
dominated system – but as in the United States, that means
political battles within those systems can throw out wildly
unpredictable consequences.
    In America, at least one knows when the next election will
be. In Britain, there is no such clarity. One will occur when
the government falls, and after May lost her outright majority
at last year’s general election – another short-term gambit that
failed – that could happen any time.
    The hope must be that whatever the short-term problems, the
Brexit saga sees a revitalization of politics on both sides,
allowing the country to focus its attention on the issues that
really count. Before we get there, however, it looks set to be
one hell of a ride.

    By Ahmed Rasheed
    SULAIMANIYA, Iraq, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament on
Tuesday elected as president Kurdish politician Barham Salih,
who immediately named Shi'ite Adel Abdul Mahdi prime
minister-designate, ending months of deadlock after an
inconclusive national election in May.
    The presidency, traditionally occupied by a Kurd, is a
largely ceremonial position but the vote for Salih was a key
step toward forming a new government, which politicians have
failed to do since the election.
    Under Iraq's constitution, Salih - a British-educated
engineer aged 58 who has held office in both the Iraqi federal
and Kurdish regional governments - had 15 days to invite the
nominee of the largest parliamentary bloc to form a government.
He chose to do so less than two hours after his election.
    Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led
invasion, power has been shared among Iraq's three largest
ethnic-sectarian components. 
    The most powerful post, that of prime minister, has
traditionally been held by a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of
parliament's by a Sunni Arab and the presidency by a Kurd.
    A former vice president, oil minister, and finance minister,
Abdul Mahdi now has 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to
parliament for approval. 
    He faces the daunting tasks of rebuilding much of the
country after four years of war with Islamic State militants,
healing its ethnic and sectarian tensions, and balancing foreign
relations with Iraq's two major allies - Iran and its arch-foe
the United States.
    Abdul Mahdi, 76, is a trained economist who left Iraq in
1969 for exile in France, where he worked for think tanks and
edited magazines in French and Arabic. He is the son of a
respected Shi'ite cleric who was a minister in the era of
Iraq's monarchy, overthrown in 1958.
    He was nominated by two rival blocs, one led by Shi'ite
cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and outgoing Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi and the other by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi
al-Amiri and former premier Nuri al-Maliki. 
    Both blocs claim to hold a parliamentary majority but the
dispute has been rendered irrelevant by their choice of the same
man to be premier.
    ""The nomination of Mr Adel Abdul Mahdi came after an
agreement between the Binaa bloc and the Islah bloc to nominate
him via consensus and not a majority bloc in order to get past
the issue of which is the majority bloc,"" said Ahmed al-Asadi, a
spokesman for the Binaa bloc led by Amiri and Maliki.

    * 1987 INF treaty seeks to avoid nuclear strikes

 (Adds tweet by Ambassador Hutchison, State Department comment)
    By Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Russia must halt its covert
development of a banned cruise missile system or the United
States will seek to destroy it before it becomes operational,
Washington's envoy to NATO said on Tuesday.
    The United States believes Russia is developing a
ground-launched system in breach of a Cold War treaty that could
allow Russia to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short
notice, but Moscow has consistently denied any such violation.
    U.S. ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said Washington
remained committed to a diplomatic solution but was prepared to
consider a military strike if development of the medium-range
system continued.
    ""At that point, we would be looking at the capability to
take out a (Russian) missile that could hit any of our
countries,"" Hutchison told a news conference.
    ""Counter measures (by the United States) would be to take
out the missiles that are in development by Russia in violation
of the treaty,"" she added. ""They are on notice.""
    Hutchison later clarified in a tweet that she was not
talking about a preemptive strike against Russia. ""My point:
Russia needs to return to INF Treaty compliance or we will need
to match its capabilities to protect US & NATO interests. The
current situation, with Russia in blatant violation, is
untenable.""
    The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty bans
medium-range missiles capable of hitting Europe or Alaska.
    In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert
said the United States had for some time argued that Moscow was
not in compliance with the treaty.
    ""What Ambassador Hutchison was talking about was improving
overall defense and deterrence posture,"" Nauert told a news
conference. ""The United States is committed to upholding its
arms control obligations and expects Russia to do the very same
thing,"" she said, adding that the U.S. was discussing the issue
with its allies.
    The Russian Foreign Ministry said that such statements were
dangerous, and that it would provide detailed answers to
Washington.
    ""It seems that people who make such statements do not
realise the level of their responsibility and the danger of
aggressive rhetoric,"" TASS news agency quoted spokeswoman Maria
Zakharova as saying.
    In the past, the ministry has said it is ready for talks
with the United States to try to preserve the treaty and would
comply with its obligations if the United States did.
    But that same year, the U.S. State Department report found
Russia had violated obligations ""not to possess, produce, or
flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range
capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), ""or to
possess or produce launchers of such missiles."" 
    The U.S. accusations are likely to further strain relations
between Moscow and the West that are at a low over Russia's 2014
seizure of Crimea, its bombing campaign in Syria and accusations
of meddling in Western elections.
    ""We have been trying to send a message to Russia for several
years that we know they are violating the treaty; we have shown
Russia the evidence that we have that they are violating the
treaty,"" Hutchison said.
    ""We are laying down the markers so that our allies will help
us bring Russia to the table,"" she added.
    U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said he would discuss
the issue with his NATO counterparts at a scheduled two-day
meeting in Brussels from Wednesday.
    ""I cannot forecast where it will go, it is a decision for
the president, but I can tell you that both on Capitol Hill and
in State Department, there is a lot of concern about this
situation and I'll return with the advice of our allies and
engage in that discussion to determine the way ahead,"" he told
reporters in Paris.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - KPMG expects Britain to ignore
calls to loosen banking rules after Brexit and said in a report
on Wednesday it may even become tougher with measures to protect
consumers and defend its financial stability from cyber attacks.
    Britain's regulators are facing pressure in some quarters to
cut bankers some slack to help London remain a top global
financial sector and major export earner after it leaves the
European Union in March 2019.
    But the government has said it will need to be able to
impose higher than global standards to ensure financial
stability and financial services minister Jon Glen told the
Financial Times this week that Britain would ""do whatever it
takes"" to maintain its status as a global financial hub.
    Consultants KPMG, whose clients include major financial
services providers and big British companies, said that
Britain's long-history of ""super equivalence"", the practice of
going beyond EU and international rules, is likely to continue.
    ""I see no sign that the UK regulators' tendency to lead the
debate on risk and conduct issues will abate, so regulation may
become more demanding, not less,"" Julie Patterson of KPMG's
Regulatory Insight Centre said.
    Charles Randell, chair of Britain's Financial Conduct
Authority, said on Tuesday that it does not see Brexit as an
opportunity to join a race to the bottom. [nL8N1WI1VS]
    KPMG said UK regulators were already becoming more hardline
on issues like operational resilience at banks.
    This week the FCA fined Tesco Bank <TSCO.L> 16.4 million
pounds for failing to head off a ""foreseeable"" cyber attack, the
first such financial penalty. [nL8N1WH2AC]
    Britain is also going ahead with rolling out senior manager
accountability rules at banks to the wider financial sector next
year, even though the EU has no equivalent regulation.
    The retail arms of banks will also have to comply with
tougher capital rules from next year under a British initiative.
    KPMG said banking supervision in Britain will be driven in
part by the relationship between the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank, given the number of cross-border lenders.
    The loss of Britain as a major actor in shaping EU financial
rules will change rulemaking in the bloc, and leave Britain's
regulators exposed to a wide range of influences and divergence
will mean extra costs for firms, KPMG said.
  
  
    ""Even if the UK is not in future constrained in any way by
EU legislation - which seems unlikely - many UK-based firm have
operations within the EU and will have to manage potentially
divergent requirements, over and above divergence with other
parts of the world,"" it added.

props up Prime Minister Theresa May warned that its ""blood red""
line was that there could be no Brexit deal that would divide
Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.
    The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland is the last major sticking point in Brexit talks, though
both sides are trying to work out how to monitor and regulate
trade over the border.
    ""There cannot be a border down the Irish sea, a differential
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK,"" DUP leader
Arlene Foster told the BBC on Tuesday. The interview was aired
on Wednesday. ""The red line is blood red.""
    ""All along we have said: 'No new regulatory alignment',""
Foster said.
    When asked if she was prepared to vote down PM May on a
Brexit deal, she said: ""We don't want to be in that position.""
    ""This is too important to be playing around with things
because this is the union - this is what brought me into
politics,"" Foster said.
    The DUP's 10 lawmakers prop up May's minority Conservative
government.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - After last year's disastrous
performance (remember the coughing fit and the disintegrating
stage decor?), Britain's Theresa May looks set to play it safe
with her keynote speech to party conference today. According to
pre-released extracts, she will make a plain-vanilla pitch based
around Brexit being a ""moment of opportunity"" to Britain, while
attacking Jeremy Corbyn's Labour for being too radical. That is
unlikely to generate wild excitement after Boris Johnson stole
the headlines yesterday with a speech specifically designed to
get Tory juices flowing, but it will likely be sufficient to
stave off leadership questions for now. The creeping threat to
May comes from her Northern Irish DUP allies who are getting
worried that she is preparing to sell them down the river to get
a Brexit deal. They are out this morning reiterating that they
would never accept an arrangement in which Northern Ireland was
put on a different regulatory footing to the rest of the UK.
    New details emerging this morning on Italy's budget plans
show the government is promising over three years to shave the
deficit down from 2.4 percent of GDP next year to two percent in
2021. That has calmed financial markets somewhat and presumably
it is also an effort to reassure Brussels - despite still not
chipping away at Rome's accumulated debt load. Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte is due to meet key ministers to discuss the
budget targets for 2019-2021 at around 1100 GMT, sources said.
    NATO defence ministers will discuss military spending and
the alliance's readiness to face down any threat from Russia at
a meeting today in Brussels. Ahead off the talks, the United
States signalled it would announce in the coming days that it
will use cyber capabilities to combat similar tactics by Russia.
Baltic and British security officials say they have intelligence
showing persistent Russian cyber hacks to try to bring down
European energy and telecommunications networks, coupled with
internet disinformation campaigns. But in Europe, the issue of
deploying malware and other tools is sensitive because
governments do not want to be seen to be using the same tactics
as Vladimir Putin.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
    World markets are absorbing a bit more optimism about
Italy’s budget overnight and a little less about the
reconstituted NAFTA trade pact. After a turbulent start to the
week for Italian government bonds, sovereign yields retreated
sharply from 4-1/2 year highs set on Tuesday after reports that
the government’s proposed budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
for next year would be followed by 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent
targets for the subsequent two years. The reports have taken the
edge off worries about the higher-than-expected 2.4 percent
figure for 2019, which many had assumed would be sustained over
the three years and risk boosting overall debt/GDP levels if
many investors see as optimistic growth assumptions fail to be
realized. Ten-year Italian sovereign yields fell 9 basis points
to 3.34 percent first thing, euro/dollar rallied back close to
$1.16 and European stock futures were up more than half a
percent. An increasingly angry war of words between Italian
leaders and other European Union officials and finance ministers
is keeping markets on edge, not least amid public comments on
the desirability of Italy leaving the euro by senior coalition
figures – comments which forced the Prime Minister on Tuesday to
insist Italy’s membership of single currency was irrevocable. 
    The more positive mood in Europe was in contrast to more
downbeat markets elsewhere, with ebullience over the renewed
U.S. trade pact with Canada and Mexico offset by jitters about
embedded clauses that would effectively give Washington a veto
over subsequent free trade agreements between Canada and Mexico
and non-‘market’ economies, such as China. Even though Shanghai
markets are closed for the week, Japan’s Nikkei, HK’s Hang Seng
and other regional bourses closed in the red. Fresh dollar
strength this week against many emerging market currencies has
seen Indonesia’s rupiah hit a new 20-year low and India’s rupee
hit another record low earlier today. Turkey’s lira was slightly
weaker first thing Wednesday ahead of September inflation
numbers. The lawyer for U.S. evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson
filed an appeal to Turkey's constitutional court for his release
from house arrest, according to broadcaster CNN Turk. Wall St
stocks was more mixed overnight. Even though the Dow Jones index
set another record closing high on the weekend trade news, the
S&P500 and Nasdaq slipped back and Facebook slipped again by
almost 2 percent amid nerves about last week’s huge data breach.
Brent crude oil prices hovered close to this week's 4-year highs
above $85 per barrel.

    Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of service companies stood at 52.5 in September, down very slightly from 52.7 in August. The index has held above the 50 line separating growth from contraction for every month since October 2013.
    ""September brought the third quarter of 2018 to an end with further signs of growth having moderated in the Spanish service sector,"" Associate Director at IHS Markit Andrew Harker said.
    ""With growth also moderating in the manufacturing sector, the PMI data suggest quarterly GDP growth of around 0.5 percent in the Q3.""
    The new orders index slipped to 53.6 in September, its lowest level of growth registered since the end of 2016, from 54.0 in August, Markit said.

    Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index for services fell in September to 54.8 from 55.4 in August, better than a preliminary reading of 54.3.
    The reading, the lowest since May, brought the index closer to the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
    IHS Markit's overall PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 54.0 from 54.9 in August, better than the 53.6 originally reported.
    Panellists reported softer new order growth in the service sector but firms kept adding to staff headcount despite weaker client demand.
    Meanwhile, service companies felt the pinch from rising cost inflation, which - tied with the level seen in June - was the highest since May 2011, the survey found.
    ""Survey respondents noted that subdued domestic economic conditions held back business investment and contributed to more cautious consumer spending,"" IHS Markit economics associate director Tim Moore said.

Confindustria said on Wednesday.
   The lobby estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) next
year would expand 0.9 percent, down from a previous projection
of 1.1 percent, and almost half the 1.6 percent the Rome

 (Updates with quotes, figures)
    By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Olesya Astakhova and Oksana Kobzeva
    MOSCOW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Russia is setting records in gas
pipeline exports despite U.S. pressure on Europe to reduce
imports, and aims to become the world's leading liquefied gas
exporter in the next decade thanks to technology it is
developing at home.
    Russian government officials and executives told an industry
conference on Wednesday they expect Russia export a record
amount of gas this year, potentially exceeding 200 billion cubic
metres (bcm) and beating last year's all-time high of 194 bcm.
    The development comes despite repeated calls by the United
States on Europe to diversify its gas imports away from the
Kremlin's pipeline monopoly Gazprom <GAZP.MM>, which Washington
says is using energy as a tool of intimidation. 
    Gazprom controls 35 percent of the gas market in Europe,
larger than any other supplier, and aims to increase its share
to 40 percent due to declining European production and the lower
cost of extracting gas in Russia.
    ""We have been hearing about the reduction in Russian
supplies for many years now,"" Russian energy minister Alexander
Novak told the conference. ""But in spite of this, Europe keeps
increasing Russian gas imports."" 
    Novak said Russia could double gas exports by 2030 to meet
soaring global demand.
    That would require Gazprom to build new pipelines to China
and Europe, adding some 163 bcm to its exports, while Russian
liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports could reach 80-115 million
tonnes.
    That would put Russia on a par with Qatar, the world's
largest LNG producer, which plans to expand its capacity to 110
million tonnes by 2024 from 77 million tonnes now.
    Russia is a fairly modest LNG producer. Its output comes
from a Gazprom-led project on Sakhalin island off Russia's
Pacific coast, and a project led by private producer Novatek
<NVTK.MM> in the Arctic Yamal peninsula.
    ""Despite the fact that the United States is reluctant to see
Russian gas, some cargoes of LNG from Yamal have reached the
United States itself this year,"" Novak said.
    Novatek's chief executive, Leonid Mikhelson, said his
company had the resources to boost output far above current
targets. The company has said it could quadruple output to as
much as 80 million tonnes of LNG.
    ""We are seeing the birth of a new industry in Russia,"" said
Mikhelson, adding that Novatek has developed technology to
liquefy gas.
    Russia has up to now relied on companies such as French oil
major Total <TOTF.PA> to build new plants and provide
technology. 
    U.S. and European sanctions on Moscow over its actions in
Ukraine have made exports of technology to Russia and the
funding of projects, such as Novatek's Yamal, challenging.
    The United States also aims to become a large LNG exporter
through its booming shale gas industry, but Mikhelson and
Gazprom's deputy chief executive Alexander Medvedev said Russian
gas would still be cheaper in Europe.
    ""As the Russian saying goes - they try to scare us but we
are not afraid,"" Medvedev told the conference. 
    He added Europe may need as much as 100 bcm of new gas
imports by 2030 because its own production is falling.

    Oct 3 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's <FB.O> photo-sharing social

suffering a worldwide outage days after it installed a new head
of the app.
    According to a check by Reuters, the mobile app and the

could post pictures and videos on to their feed. 
    Earlier, the app displayed an error message saying ""couldn't

    Users bombarded Twitter to complain about the outage,
tweeting jokes and comments along with the #instagramdown
hashtag.
    ""How am I supposed to know who likes avocado on toast now

    DownDetector's live outage map earlier showed that parts of
North America, Europe, Australia, India, Singapore and other
countries were facing issues with the service. http://bit.ly/2ydg8We
    Facebook and Instagram were not immediately available to
comment.
    The global outage comes after Instagram announced on Monday
that long-term insider Adam Mosseri will take over as the new
head of the photo-sharing app, a week after its co-founders
resigned. [nL4N1WH4EW]
    The app has more than one billion active monthly users and
has grown by adding features such as messaging and short videos.

    Oct 3 (Reuters) - Soaring inflation hammered Turkish bonds
and the lira on Wednesday and India's rupee hit a fresh record
low as high oil prices and a solid dollar kept the pressure on
emerging markets.
    The lira <TRY=> was firmly back above 6 to the dollar after
data showed Turkish consumer prices surged nearly 25 percent in
September, hitting its highest in over a decade as a deepening
currency crisis pushed up prices of everything from food to
fuel. [nL8N1WJ189]
    The lira fell as much as 2.15 percent against the dollar 
before paring losses to trade 0.9 percent weaker.
    ""The key point to note here is that headline inflation is
above the central bank's forecast. The central bank will need to
react to this print. This is not something that could be ignored
and they will have to hike at their next meeting,"" said Inan
Demir, senior emerging market economist at Nomura.
    The central bank surprised investors by raising interest
rates by 625 basis points last month, in efforts to support the
lira that has fallen nearly 40 percent against the dollar this
year, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's influence
over monetary policy and a diplomatic rift with the Washington
over a detained U.S. pastor.
    The lawyer for pastor Andrew Brunson said he filed an appeal
to Turkey's constitutional court for his client's release from
house arrest. The next court hearing on Brunson's case is on
Oct. 12.
    ""We have a high-profile political event ahead of (the next
central bank meeting), and if that is not resolved in a
beneficial way, that means the central bank may have to react
even earlier than at their next meeting,"" said Demir.
    Investors were also restrained ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs
data which could give more impetus for the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates this year and next, heaping more pressure
on these currencies.
    The Indian rupee <INR=> hit a record low of 73.415 before
recovering some ground after a report that the government was in
talks with the central bank for a special dollar swap window
with some state-run fuel retailers.[nI8N1V401S]
    The Indonesian rupiah <IDR=> slipped to its weakest in two
decades. Bank Indonesia flagged another possible rate hike to
avoid ""drastic capital reversals"". [nL4N1WJ150]
    A recovery for the euro <EUR=> from six-week lows after a
report that Italy was planning to trim its budget deficit in the
coming years, bolstered Central European currencies.
[nR1N1VZ00P]
    Poland's zloty <PLN=> was 0.37 percent firmer, leading the
gains in the region, while Hungary's forint <HUF=> was 0.34
percent stronger. Romania's leu <RON=> and Croatia's crown
<HRK=> also gained.

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Central European currencies
mostly firmed on Wednesday as European markets calmed down after
jitters over Italy's debt and the country's future in the euro
zone.
    Stocks also tracked euro zone peers higher after Italian
daily Corriere Della Sera said Rome's budget deficits could be
lower than earlier planned. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    Budapest's main stock index <.BUX>, knocked down in the
previous session by worries over Italy, rose 1 percent by 0810
GMT, approaching Monday's four-week high.
    Hungarian data released on Wednesday showed a pick-up in
annual retail sales growth to 6.8 percent in August from 5.3
percent in July, underpinning consumption as a key economic
driver, like elsewhere in Central Europe.
    The region's most liquid currencies, the forint <EURHUF=>
and the zloty <EURPLN=> were both 0.1 percent firmer against the
euro by 0810 GMT. The forint had set a six-week high in early
trade at 322.4.
    The two units have outperformed the crown and the leu in
recent weeks, even though the Hungarian and Polish central banks
have kept interest rates at record lows, while their Czech and
Romanian peers have raised rates to fight inflation.
    Analysts expect the Polish bank to keep its main rate at 1.5
percent at its meeting on Wednesday, and retain its forecast for
no change possibly for years, after Poland's annual inflation
slowed to 1.8 percent in September.
    The Polish and the Romanian central banks target the same
inflation range, at 1.5-3.5 percent.
    The Romanian bank has been increasing interest rates because
Romanian inflation has accelerated to levels around 5 percent,
even though it is expected to retreat in the last months of the
year.
    But the central bank is also seen holding fire on Wednesday.
    Its comments about its future rate course will be closely
watched after a softening in its rhetoric at its last rate
meeting two months ago. [nL5N1UX27S]
    The leu <EURRON=>, trading at 4.666 versus the euro, was
steady, but near last week's three-month low of 4.671.
    The crown <EURCZK=>, easing 0.1 percent to 25.806, hovered
near 2-and-1/2-month lows, even though the Czech central bank
increased its rates at each of its last three rate meetings, the
last time last week.
    The leu and the crown have still well outperformed the zloty
and the forint this year, even though the past weeks' rebound in
emerging market currencies left them underperformers.
    ""We believe that those currencies which suffered previously
the most will do best in the coming weeks and months,""
Raiffeisen analyst Sebastian Petric said in a note.
    ""Among our favourite longs are, for instance, the Polish
zloty,"" he added.
    Central European credit ""is still one of the resilient areas
in emerging markets, the fundamentals still look very strong and
growth is still broad-based across the CEE space, still solid,"" 
said ING analyst Trieu Pham.

    ROME, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy's populist government may cut
its budget deficit targets from 2020 after investors sold off
Italian assets and European Union ministers blasted its plans to
jack up spending next year, a government source said on
Wednesday.
    The ruling coalition last week said it planned to run a
deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next
year, tripling the previous government's target, adding that the
deficit would stay at that level through 2021.
    While the announcement unnerved markets and prompted
criticism from European Commission officials, the executive had
been defiant, with 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio pledging
on Tuesday not to backtrack ""by a millimetre"".[nL8N1WI4KW]
    But on Wednesday government sources told Reuters the aim is
now to reduce the deficit in 2020 and 2021, to no higher than
2.2 percent of GDP and 2 percent respectively, and possibly
lower.
    League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said
in a TV interview that the new plan was to reduce the deficit
from 2020, without specifying what the targets would be.
    The coalition came to power in June promising to slash taxes
and boost welfare spending, and says an expansionary budget next
year will boost economic growth and thereby curb Italy's debt -
the largest in Europe after Greece at about 131 percent of GDP.
    President Sergio Mattarella hopes there will be as little
deficit spending as possible but is not trying to dictate
numbers to the government, a source close to the president said
on Wednesday.
    Italian media have reported Mattarella is exerting pressure
on the government behind the scenes to keep public finances
under control and avoid a head-on collision with the EU.  
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to meet with key
ministers to discuss the  budget targets for 2019-2021 at around
1100 GMT on Wednesday, a separate government source said.
    Italian government bond yields tumbled on the reports of the
lower deficit goals, and the euro gained against the
dollar.[nL8N1WJ0V5]

    By Stephen Jewkes
    MILAN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy raised a bumper 6.5 billion
euros ($7.52 billion) for state coffers in its fifth-generation
mobile auction that drew ferocious bidding from telecoms
operators vying for an edge in new digital services.
    After 14 days of bidding, the industry ministry announced an
end to hostilities on Tuesday after selling some of the most
prized spectra on offer for more than twice the 2.5 billion
euros it had set as a minimum target.
    Italy is one of the first countries in Europe to offer
frequencies for 5G services, allowing operators to roll out
ultra-fast internet connections to Italian homes and businesses.
    The record outlay could be a bonanza for the country's
anti-establishment ruling coalition that is struggling to find
cash to fund welfare and tax spending while paying down debt.
    But the bidding war has raised questions about the
sustainability of investments for telecoms operators facing ever
tougher competition.
    Italy's biggest phone group Telecom Italia (TIM) <TLIT.MI>
spent more than 2.4 billion euros for airwaves over the two
weeks of bidding in a move expected to raise debt at the former
telecom monopoly.
    TIM, which expects to pay out around 480 million euros of
the bill this year, said it had spent more on spectra and won
more bandwidth than its competitors as it gears up to roll out
new 5G services to connect consumers to the internet of things.
    ""The new frequencies acquired represent a fundamental asset
for the future development of the group,"" said TIM CEO Amos
Genish.
    Andrea Scauri, fund manager at Italy's Ifigest, said he had
pulled out of TIM a while back and was not going back in the
foreseeable future. ""They have a lot of debt which they need to
resolve and the 5G has not exactly helped,"" he said.
    
    CHALLENGE
    Increasing competition and changing technologies have
pressured telecom operators' profits, undermining share
performance.
    On Wednesday, TIM's shares were up 0.4 percent by 0850 GMT
after falling sharply in recent weeks on worries over the
higher-than-expected spectrum spend and increasingly tougher
competition in both fixed services and mobile. 
    TIM's competitor Vodafone Italy <VOD.L> spent nearly as
much, buying airwaves in three frequency ranges for a total of
2.4 billion euros. It said some of the airwaves it bought could
be immediately used to enhance coverage and improve capacity.
    France's Iliad <ILD.PA>, which entered the Italian market in
May to offset tough competition at home, said it paid 1.19
billion euros in the auction.
    Bernstein analysts said given the life of the spectrum is 20
years, turning a profit would be a challenge though not
improbable. ""Today, it stings. Longer-term, the strategic
benefit accrues to TIM and Vodafone,"" they said in a research
note. 
    Some telecom operators had previously threatened to stay
away from the auction because of what they saw as a high
starting price and punitive bidding rules.
    The higher-than-expected financial outlay could impact TIM's
ambition to return to an investment grade rating next year. 
    TIM, whose biggest shareholder is French media giant Vivendi
<VIV.PA>, faces increasing competition at home after Iliad's and
domestic broadband rival Open Fiber's decision to roll out a new
ultrafast fiber network across Italy.
    The phone company, which is saddled with 25 billion euros of
net debt, is also facing headwinds from currency devaluation in
Brazil and a bitter dispute between Vivendi and activist
shareholder Elliott.

 (Adds reaction)
    By James Davey
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Weak trading in Thailand and
Poland took the shine off accelerating sales growth in Tesco's
main UK business, with shares in Britain's biggest retailer
falling sharply after it missed first-half profit forecasts.
    The company, being rebuilt by Chief Executive Dave Lewis
following a 2014 accounting scandal, unsettled investors as
problems abroad compounded fears that competition at home would
intensify with the planned merger of its closest rivals. 
    The group, which stuck to its medium-term targets, reported
underlying operating profit of 933 million pounds ($1.21
billion) - up 24 percent on last year but short of the 978
million pounds analysts had expected.
    Profit fell 29.1 percent in Asia and by 3.3 percent in
central Europe, partly offsetting growth of 47.6 percent in the
UK and Ireland where it has benefited from its acquisition of
wholesaler Booker in a 3.7 billion pound ($4.8 billion) deal.
    Shares in Tesco, up 12 percent this year prior to the
update, fell 7.8 percent by 0945 GMT, on course for the biggest
one-day drop since July 2016.     
    ""I don't think the market had fully factored in the Asian
side (of the business) but we're really encouraged by the UK,""
Chief Financial Officer Alan Stewart told reporters.
    Lewis has been steering a recovery after an accounting
scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. He has bought
Booker to reach new markets such as restaurants and improved
Tesco stores, staffing and lowered its prices.
    Analysts said the results showed the company was heading in
the right direction with the UK and Ireland, which contribute
nearly three quarters of group profit, performing well. 
    But challenges lie ahead. 
    
    GROWING PRESSURES 
    Tesco has a leading 27.4 percent share of Britain's grocery
market, according to industry data, although it could be
overtaken by Sainsbury's <SBRY.L> proposed 7.3 billion pound
takeover of Walmart's <WMT.N> Asda. [nL8N1W41LJ]
    The tie-up between Tesco's two nearest competitors, which
the regulator is probing, is driven in part by the rise of
discounters Aldi and Lidl, who are gaining ground on Britain's
big four grocers, as well as the growth of Amazon. [nL8N1WD44F] 
    ""There are any number of incremental improvements within
this statement. However, it is not all plain sailing,"" said
Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at Interactive Investor. ""To
maintain the market consensus of the shares as a strong buy,
Tesco needs to keep a firm hand on the tiller.""  
    In Asia second quarter like-for-like sales fell 4.8 percent,
which reflects Tesco's decision to exit non-profitable cash and
carry sales in Thailand. Underlying sales in the Central Europe
division fell 2.0 percent, reflecting weak sales in Poland.
    Lewis said Tesco was committed to both Thailand and Poland.
    ""In Thailand we're market leader, it's still the most
profitable part of the group and there's still significant
growth to be had,"" he said.
    Tesco was suffering in Poland because of restrictions on
Sunday trading.
    ""We’ve lost a number of trading days again in the quarter
and that just requires us to keep constantly improving the
efficiency and productivity of that business in what is quite a
challenging market,"" said Lewis.
    He said the difficulties in Thailand and Poland did not
imperil Tesco's key margin target for the group to earn between
3.5 and 4 pence of operating profit for every pound customers
spend by the end of its 2019-20 financial year.
    Tesco was ""firmly on track"" to hit that target as well as
cost savings of 1.5 billion pounds and the generation of 9
billion pounds of retail cash.
    
    STRONG SUMMER
    Analysts at Barclays said that was ""an important reiteration
given that the delivery date is only 18 months away.""
    They maintained their ""overweight"" stance but cut their full
2018-19 year operating profit forecast for Tesco by about 3
percent to 2.06 billion pounds and their forecast for the
following year by 2 percent.
    Tesco held its own in a strong summer for Britain's overall
grocery industry which was boosted by record hot weather, a
royal wedding and the soccer World Cup, delivering a 2.5 percent
increase in second quarter like-for-like sales - an eleventh
straight quarter of growth.
    After the Booker deal it has also made further restructuring
moves in the market. It has agreed to form a global purchasing
alliance with France's Carrefour <CARR.PA>, while last month it
launched Tesco's new discount format Jack's. [nL5N1QN17V]
[nL8N1TY0TM] [nL8N1W526I]

    * Italy raises 6.5 bln euros in 5G auction
    * Telecom Italia, Vodafone to spend 2.4 bln euros each 
    * High 5G spend raises concerns over operators' profits

    By Stephen Jewkes
    MILAN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy raised a bumper 6.5 billion
euros ($7.52 billion) for state coffers in its fifth-generation
mobile auction that drew ferocious bidding from telecoms
operators vying for an edge in new digital services.
    After 14 days of bidding, the industry ministry announced an
end to hostilities on Tuesday after selling some of the most
prized spectra on offer for more than twice the 2.5 billion
euros it had set as a minimum target.
    Italy is one of the first countries in Europe to offer
frequencies for 5G services, allowing operators to roll out
ultra-fast internet connections to Italian homes and businesses.
    The record outlay could be a bonanza for the country's
anti-establishment ruling coalition that is struggling to find
cash to fund welfare and tax spending while paying down debt.
    But the bidding war has raised questions about the
sustainability of investments for telecoms operators facing ever
tougher competition.
    Italy's biggest phone group Telecom Italia (TIM) <TLIT.MI>
spent more than 2.4 billion euros for airwaves over the two
weeks of bidding in a move expected to raise debt at the former
telecom monopoly.
    TIM, which expects to pay out around 480 million euros of
the bill this year, said it had spent more on spectra and won
more bandwidth than its competitors as it gears up to roll out
new 5G services to connect consumers to the internet of things.
    ""The new frequencies acquired represent a fundamental asset
for the future development of the group,"" said TIM CEO Amos
Genish.
    Andrea Scauri, fund manager at Italy's Ifigest, said he had
pulled out of TIM a while back and was not going back in the
foreseeable future. ""They have a lot of debt which they need to
resolve and the 5G has not exactly helped,"" he said.
    
    CHALLENGE
    Increasing competition and changing technologies have
pressured telecom operators' profits, undermining share
performance.
    On Wednesday, TIM's shares were up 0.4 percent by 0850 GMT
after falling sharply in recent weeks on worries over the
higher-than-expected spectrum spend and increasingly tougher
competition in both fixed services and mobile. 
    TIM's competitor Vodafone Italy <VOD.L> spent nearly as
much, buying airwaves in three frequency ranges for a total of
2.4 billion euros. It said some of the airwaves it bought could
be immediately used to enhance coverage and improve capacity.
    France's Iliad <ILD.PA>, which entered the Italian market in
May to offset tough competition at home, said it paid 1.19
billion euros in the auction.
    Bernstein analysts said given the life of the spectrum is 20
years, turning a profit would be a challenge though not
improbable. ""Today, it stings. Longer-term, the strategic
benefit accrues to TIM and Vodafone,"" they said in a research
note. 
    Some telecom operators had previously threatened to stay
away from the auction because of what they saw as a high
starting price and punitive bidding rules.
    The higher-than-expected financial outlay could impact TIM's
ambition to return to an investment grade rating next year. 
    TIM, whose biggest shareholder is French media giant Vivendi
<VIV.PA>, faces increasing competition at home after Iliad's
entry and domestic broadband rival Open Fiber's decision to roll
out a new ultrafast fiber network across Italy.
    The phone company, which is saddled with 25 billion euros of
net debt, is also facing headwinds from currency devaluation in
Brazil and a bitter dispute between Vivendi and activist
shareholder Elliott.

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union
must focus on getting a divorce deal with an Irish border fix
before they embark on discussions on their post-Brexit trade
ties, the Czech Republic's pointman on Europe said. 
    Britain is due to leave the EU in 177 days but talks on
managing the unprecedented split have stalled over differences
on how to avoid border checks between EU-member Ireland and
Britain's province of Northern Ireland.
    Eyes are on British Prime Minister Theresa May's speech at
her Conservative Party conference on Wednesday. [nL8N1WI5PB] A
flurry of activity will follow as both sides seek to try to
break the deadlock in time for EU summits on Oct.18 and
Nov.17-18. [nL8N1WI4Y0]
    ""The chief concern for the EU right now is reaching a deal
on the Withdrawal Agreement that would provide us with a two
year transition period in which to set out the future
relationship between the EU and the UK,"" State Secretary for
European Affairs Ales Chmelar said, adding divorce must cover an
Irish fix. 
    Britain's preferred option is focusing on agreeing close
future trade ties. London wants this post-Brexit arrangement to
regulate the Irish border but the bloc wants an emergency
solution if trade talks fail or take longer.
    ""The future relationship ... is a matter for future
discussions. Without the Withdrawal Agreement we are, very soon,
heading towards a no-deal scenario in which a hard border would
inevitably be drawn up,"" Chmelar said. 
    As both sides ready concessions, Britain is expected to
present a new proposal for the Irish border soon. 
    The other 27 EU member states will put in writing for the
first time next week their free trade proposal for Britain for
after Brexit, hoping a more fleshed-out promise would woo London
into compromises on Ireland and help May get enough support
behind any divorce deal. 
    The EU rejected London's previous fix for Ireland last June
because it envisaged only a time-limited emergency border
backstop and assumed all of the UK would remain in the EU's
customs area for a while after Brexit.
    EU diplomats stressed they have not yet seen the new British
plan, but warned against recasting what was already discussed
after Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab told his party's
conference: ""We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs
backstop."" [nL8N1WH5X3]
    ""We will be open to looking at some of the options on
regulatory checks,"" he added, though it was not sure if that
would also cover manufactured goods.[nL8N1WH5X3]
    Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, on whose
support May relies to govern, was quick on Tuesday to reject
differing regulation to the rest of the UK after Brexit.

    BUCHAREST, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate <ROINTR=ECI> on hold at 2.50 percent on
Wednesday, as expected, with policymakers likely confident that
persistently high inflation will fall to within its target band
by the end of the year.
    Eight out of ten analysts polled by Reuters had expected the
bank to hold fire.
    Higher energy prices and consumption-friendly wage hikes
drove annual inflation in the import-reliant European Union
state to multi-year highs earlier in 2018 and the bank has
raised interest rates three times by 75 basis points in all.
    But base effects and a slowdown in economic growth are
expected to help drive inflation to the bank's upper target
range of 1.5-3.5 percent. Inflation stood at 5.1 percent at the
end of August.
    At 1020 GMT, the leu <EURRON=> was unchanged by the
decision, trading at 4.6645, 0.1 percent firmer against the
euro.
    In August, Governor Mugur Isarescu said there was not much
room left for rates to climb further, adding the bank had made
the right call when it decided to start tightening at the start
of the year, preventing the need for higher hikes. [nL5N1UX27S] 
    ""We expect the central bank to stay on hold for the
remainder of this year,"" ING Romania chief economist Ciprian
Dascalu said in a note, ""likely citing the need for assessing
both the transmission of previous policy tightening and incoming
data as recent GDP growth figures surprised to the downside.""
    Governor Isarescu is expected to provide details on the
decision from 1200 GMT.

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Telecom operators at
mobile spectrum auctions are like sitting ducks: they have
little choice but to bid for airwaves that carry mobile signals.
Italy raised 6.6 billion euros by exploiting their situation.
Others will face the consequences.
    The proceeds are almost three times the sum originally
estimated by Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who heads the
radical 5-Star Movement that is governing in coalition with the
right-wing League. On the industry’s favoured measure of
megahertz per capita, Italy’s sale price is more than twice the
value of similar fifth-generation (5G) spectrum sold in Britain
earlier this year and almost eight times as costly as Spain’s,
using Bernstein estimates. 
    At first glance that seems a coup for a country with 2.3
trillion euros of public debt and whose 2019 budget deficit
forecast has alarmed investors. In reality, the 5G auction is a
smash-and-grab: either customers will pay more, or operators
will have less cash to build the much-hyped superfast 5G
networks. 
    The secret to Italy’s bonanza was a canny auction design
that lumped much of the prized 3.7 gigahertz frequency into two
chunky 80 MHz blocks. Britain and Spain offered much smaller
blocks of 5 to 10 MHz. Since Italy’s bidders couldn’t share the
spoils more equally, Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI> and Vodafone
<VOD.L> had to overbid to avoid being left with scraps. The two
big lots, out of 14, accounted for more than half total
proceeds.
    That’s bad auction design. First, selling such huge lots
risks creating a 5G duopoly: consumers might prefer smaller
blocs spread between more players. That would also allow
operators to bid more precisely according to their needs. 
    Second, simply maximising government revenue is the wrong
aim. The big winners - Telecom Italia and Vodafone - can
probably break even on their investments over time, Bernstein
analysts reckon, but only by hiking prices. That would
effectively make the auction a tax on mobile users. Italy’s
hyper-competitive mobile market means it may be hard to pass all
the costs to customers. In that case, operators would have to
cut back on investment in mobile networks or fibre broadband.
Italy’s gain is the loss of consumers waiting for superfast
mobile internet.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italy said on Oct. 2 that its auction of fifth-generation
(5G) mobile spectrum raised 6.55 billion euros, or 164 percent
more than the value of initial offers.
    - Debt-heavy Telecom Italia spent 2.41 billion euros, and
said it expected to pay out around 480 million euros of the
overall amount in 2018. 
    - Vodafone Italy bought airwaves in three frequency ranges
for a total of 2.4 billion euros. It said some of the spectrum
could be immediately used to enhance coverage and improve
capacity.
    - France’s Iliad paid about 1.2 billion euros, while Wind
Tre paid just over 500 million euros. Fastweb, a broadband and
landline company, bought a small block of spectrum for roughly
33 million euros. 
    - Telecom Italia and Vodafone shares were up 0.6 percent and
1.3 percent respectively at 0810 GMT on Oct. 3. Iliad rose 0.7
percent and CK Hutchison – the holding company of Wind Tre’s
Hong Kong-based parent – was down almost 1 percent.

Minister Theresa May defended her Brexit plans on Wednesday, but
cautioned that she would rather leave without a deal than accept
the carve up of the United Kingdom.
    May, who received a standing ovation after dancing onto the
stage to Dancing Queen by ABBA, said she was confident that she
could clinch a deal with the EU. There would, she said, be no
second referendum.
    ""Britain isn't afraid to leave with no deal if we have to,""
May said. ""But we need to be honest about it. Leaving without a

be a bad outcome for the UK and the EU.""

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 03: Fitch Ratings has assigned Oak No.2 PLC's notes 
a final rating, as follows:

GBP325,000,000 Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable

GBP39,548,000 Class Z VFN: Not rated

This transaction is a securitisation of prime residential owner-occupied 
mortgages originated by Aldermore Bank PLC (Aldermore) in England and Wales. 
This is the second securitisation in the Oak series. The previous transaction 
was Oak No.1 plc, which closed in April 2014.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

New Originations

All mortgage loans in the pool were originated between 2016 and 2018, with the 
majority (64.3%) originated in 2017. The high proportion of recent originations 
leads to a low weighted average (WA) seasoning of 14 months. The low seasoning 
of the pool, together with the inclusion of high loan-to-value (LTV) loans 
(Aldermore lends up to 95.0%), leads to a relatively high WA sustainable LTV.

Prime Underwriting

Fitch has used its prime foreclosure frequency (FF) matrix with a lender 
adjustment of 1.10x. Aldermore takes a manual approach to underwriting, 
targeting borrowers who do not necessarily qualify in the scorecard models used 
by high-street lenders. As a result, Aldermore attracts a higher proportion of 
first-time buyers and self-employed borrowers. The selection criteria for the 
pool restrict any borrowers with prior adverse credit.

First-Time Buyers

A high 35.7% of the pool comprises mortgages to first-time buyers, which 
increases the overall WA LTV of the pool. First-time buyers generally borrow at 
a higher LTV, which is evidenced by a WA combined LTV (CLTV) of 87.6% for 
first-time buyers in the pool compared with an overall WA CLTV of 73.8%.

Self-Employed Borrowers

When assessing affordability, Fitch has typically observed prime lenders require 
a minimum of two years' income information and use a two-year average or, if 
income is declining, the lower figure. Fitch notes that Aldermore's underwriting 
practices allows for underwriters' discretion in using the latest year's income 
if it is increasing. Fitch applied an increase of 30% to the FF for 
self-employed borrowers with verified income instead of the 20% increase as per 
Fitch's criteria.

Product Switches Permitted

Fitch modelled margin compression in its cash flow analysis, as a result of 
product switches being permitted within the transaction. The overall objective 
and impact of modelling product switches is a reduction in the asset margins 
based on the conditions around product switches, as documented within the 
transaction documentation.

VARIATIONS FROM CRITERIA

Self-Employed Borrowers

Of the borrowers in the pool, 30.9% are self-employed with verified income. 
Aldermore may choose to lend to self-employed individuals with only one year's 
income verification completed within certain limits, although Fitch notes that 
the selection criteria for the pool restrict any such loans through a 
representation in the mortgage sale agreement stating that at least two year's 
accounts have been provided for every self-employed borrower.

When assessing affordability, Fitch has typically observed prime lenders require 
a minimum of two years' income information and use a two-year average or, if 
income is declining, the lower figure. Fitch notes that Aldermore's underwriting 
practices allows for underwriters' discretion in using the latest year's income 
if profit is increasing. Fitch applied a 30% increase to the FF for 
self-employed borrowers with verified income instead of the 20% increase as per 
Fitch's criteria.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Material increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
receivables producing losses greater than Fitch's base case expectations may 
result in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch's analysis revealed that a 
30% increase in the WAFF, along with a 30% decrease in the WA recovery rate, 
would imply a downgrade of the class A notes to 'A+'sf from 'AAA'sf.

More detailed model implied ratings sensitivity can be found in the new issue 
report, which is available at www.fitchratings.com.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset 
portfolio information, and concluded that there were no findings that affected 
the rating analysis.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable.

conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it 
in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification 
of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are 
available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's 
factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of 
relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its 
advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as

in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or

any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or 
sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals

for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer 
and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be 
changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the 
adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular 
investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to 
any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000

 (Writes through after May speech, adds details)
    LONDON, Oct 3(Reuters) - The British pound fell briefly
towards a three-week low on Wednesday as Prime Minister Theresa
May defended her plans for Brexit, although the currency's moves
were limited and analysts said they saw little in her speech
that was new. 
     May said she was confident Britain can agree a deal for its
exit from the European Union, although she cautioned that she
would rather leave without a deal than accept the carve up of
the United Kingdom. [nS8N1JB029]
    Sterling was weaker before May delivered her annual speech
to the Conservative Party conference, but did slip further as
she pledged to stick with her Brexit plans when the UK and the
EU enter another round of negotiations on their divorce.
    ""In between dancing onto stage and criticising the Labour
Party, there was little fresh rhetoric today from Theresa May on
her stance on Brexit. The market reaction was muted, and despite
a small wobble, the pound’s response was not as pronounced as we
have seen in the last few weeks,"" said Hamish Muress, currency
analyst at OFX.
    The pound dropped 0.4 percent on the day to as low as
$1.2963 <GBP=D3>, close to Tuesday's three-week low of $1.2941,
before recovering to $1.2990 by 1212 GMT. Sterling was unmoved
versus the euro at 88.995 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    The currency has been hit hard by concerns over a growing
conflict within her party over May's Brexit plan with the pound
falling to its lowest since Sept. 10 in the previous session. 
    Analysts said there was little to excite currency traders in
May's speech, with attention shifting to the next phase of talks
with Brussels. 
    ""Nothing new of substance on Brexit... $GBP markets now
looking to upcoming Brexit talks. Most interesting thing may be
'end to austerity' preview of a slightly more expansionary UK
budget,"" Viraj Patel, an analyst at ING, said on Twitter.
    Earlier on Wednesday, a survey showed Britain's services
sector kept up its steady growth in September but uncertainty
about the economy remained high six months ahead of Brexit. The
currency was little moved. [nS8N1V7041]

    PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - European Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici welcomed on Wednesday Italy's plans to revise its
public deficit cutting plans, but warned Rome was still at risk
of breaking EU rules in 2019.
    Italy's populist-led government said last week it planned to
run a deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
next year, tripling the previous government's target. It also
said that the deficit would stay at that level through 2021.
    After the announcement triggered a sell-off in Italian
assets and EU criticism, Rome said on Wednesday it would cut its
deficit from 2020.
    ""It's a good signal that the trajectory has been revised
because it shows that the Italian authorities are hearing the
concerns and remarks from their partners and the European
Commission,"" Moscovici said on the sidelines of a conference in
Paris.
    Moscovici said, however, that the core element of Italy's
public sector deficit risked not being in line with the terms of
euro zone rules if the overall deficit being targetted in 2019
was 2.4 percent of GDP as mentioned by Rome.    
    ""The rules are there,"" he said. ""If it (the overall deficit)
is 2.4 percent, it's possible that the structural deficit will
not be within the bounds of the (EU) stability and growth pact"".
   
    Moscovici, whose portfolio at the EU executive is economic
and financial affairs, said he would withhold judgment of the
2019 budget until it is formally presented in detail to the
European Commission for review later this month.

 (Adds reaction from German automotive association VDA)
    By Gilbert Reilhac, Alissa de Carbonnel and Daphne
Psaledakis
    STRASBOURG/BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers backed a
target on Wednesday to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars
and vans by an ambitious 40 percent by 2030, drawing howls from
the car industry and setting the stage for a battle with
national governments.
    Parties in the European Parliament tussled until the final
hours before the vote on how tough to make the curbs on one of
Europe's most important industries, part of efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
    EU lawmakers backed the target, which is more stringent than
that proposed by the European Commission, by 389 to 239. They
also set a 20 percent target for 2025, with the reductions based
on 2021 figures. 
    In what came down to a clash between concerns over industry
competitiveness and fighting climate change, the European
carmakers' lobby warned the target backed by lawmakers could
costs jobs.
    ""The European Parliament is setting completely unrealistic
targets. It ignores technical and economic feasibility. The
targets cannot be achieved in this period of time,"" Bernhard
Mattes, president of German automotive association VDA, said.
    He said that he industry is hoping that upcoming
negotiations between the European Council, Commission and
Parliament would result in decisions that are more reasonable
and measured.
    The EU's new rules for the transport sector - the only one
in which emissions are still rising - aim to help meet the goal
of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990
levels by 2030.
    ""If we don't make sure that Europe is able to produce clean
cars within a reasonable time frame, we will not only miss our
Paris Climate Change targets but the European car industry will
lag behind,"" said Malta's Miriam Dalli, who shepherded the vote
through the chamber.
    The executive European Commission's own draft law proposes
less exacting CO2 reduction targets of 15 percent by 2025 and 30
percent by 2030 compared with 2021 levels.
    
    DIESELGATE
    Wednesday's vote set lawmakers' position for negotiations on
the final targets with the bloc's 28 member states, which are
still debating their position.
    Germany, voicing worries that more ambitious climate targets
will cost jobs in its big automotive sector, has said it will
back the Commission's initial proposal. It set out its own plans
on Tuesday to cut pollution from older diesel vehicles.
[nL8N1WI1K1] [nL8N1WC3PB]  
    But other EU governments, including France, are seeking a
higher target.
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it had
masked exhaust emissions using software in as many as 11 million
diesel vehicles worldwide has galvanised EU regulators into
setting tougher rules. [nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    In response to a recent EU study that showed carmakers
cheating new pollution checks, EU lawmakers added an amendment
requiring figures to be verified against on-road tests.
[nL5N1UL2JU]
    They introduce a credit system for carmakers to encourage
the rollout of electric vehicles, as well as fines for exceeding
CO2 limits.
    Under the plan, carmakers would be able to lower their CO2
targets by meeting a benchmark for the sale of zero- and
low-emission vehicles as a share of their total new car sales.
    Wednesday's vote proposed to set these at 20 percent in 2025
and 35 percent in 2030 and added penalties for failing to meet
that benchmark.
    The European carmakers' lobby (ACEA), however, warned
against what it called ""extremely aggressive"" targets and sales
quotas for electric vehicles.
    ""Today's vote risks having a very negative impact on jobs
across the automotive value chain,"" ACEA's head Erik Jonnaert
said. ""It would essentially force the industry into a dramatic
transformation in record time."" [nL5N1VX2E5] [nL2N1WH085]

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - European Union banks should be
allowed to continue using British clearing houses for
derivatives transactions even under a no-deal Brexit, a top EU
regulator said on Wednesday, in an effort  to quell rising
concern in markets.
    With just six months to go until Brexit, Britain and the EU 
have still not agreed a divorce settlement that would include a
""standstill"" transition period from March until the end of 2020.
    Cross-border banks fear that if Britain crashes out of the
bloc, they could no longer use LCH, a unit of the London Stock
Exchange <LSE.L> that clears about 90 percent of
euro-denominated interest rate swaps. There is too little time
to move contracts from LCH to EU rivals before March.
    LCH can't apply for EU authorisation as a foreign clearing
house or central counterparty (CCP) until after Britain has left
the EU, meaning a potentially destabilising legal hiatus looms.
    ""To respond to those risks to the stability of EU financial
markets, in my view we need to ensure continued access to UK
CCPs for EU clearing members and trading venues,"" Steven
Maijoor, chair of the bloc's European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA) said.
    It is the clearest signal yet that LCH in London would not
face a problem obtaining EU authorisation. Scott O'Malia, chief
executive of global derivatives industry body ISDA, called last
week for such authorisation to be a matter of urgency.
    Faced with a critical part of its financial system's
plumbing being based outside the bloc, Brussels has proposed
tougher supervision of foreign clearers if they want EU market
access.
    Maijoor urged ""swift"" approval of the draft law,
""complemented by a transitional provision allowing for the
continued access to UK-based CCPs"".
    LCH had no comment on Maijoor's speech to an audience of
stock exchange executives in Athens.
    Tim Cant, a financial regulatory partner at Ashurst law
firm, said ESMA's backing for speedy action regarding British
clearing houses would put an end to the ""melodrama"" that has
surrounded EU pronouncements on the matter.
    In another safeguard against disruption from a no-deal
Brexit, Maijoor said there would be ""memorandums of
understanding"" (MOU) with British regulators, allowing them to
continue swapping information, crucial for enforcement cases.
    ""Taking the wider negotiations between the EU and UK into
account, we plan to start negotiations with the UK Financial
Conduct Authority with the objective to have these MOUs in place
sufficiently on time before the end of March 2019,"" Maijoor
said.

million due to lower financing costs. 

Eutelsat S.A's parent, Eutelsat Communications S.A. (Eutelsat; BBB/Stable) has a 
leading position in the fixed global satellite sector. The company has a strong 
position in the video segment, which underpins a cash-generative business model 
and its credit profile. Leverage metrics and financial flexibility have recently 
improved following lower-than-expected capex outlay, retained organic FCF and 
the receipt of Hispasat disposal proceeds. Retaining financial flexibility is 
essential to the ratings as it enables the company to adjust its financial 
profile to changes in the operating environment. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Core Video Segment Stable: Eutelsat generates around 64% of its revenue from the 
video segment. The company has a strong competitive position in the segment, 
which is supported by high end-customer switching costs and entry barriers 
created from the ownership of regulated, orbital positions and frequencies. This 
enables the company to maintain high capacity utilisation rates, which combined 
with typical seven-to eight-year customer contracts, drive strong EBITDA margins 
(around 77% at group level) and provide stability and visibility to cash flows.

Data Segment Exposure Manageable: The contribution of revenue from the fixed 
data segment declined to 10% in FY17/18 (financial year to end June). The 
persistent decline reflects a structurally challenged segment where 
overcapacity, exacerbated by the deployment of high-throughput satellites (HTS), 
is putting severe pressure on prices. The deployment of lower orbit satellite 
constellations by new entrants may create further pressure in the medium term. 
Fitch's base case forecasts envisage fixed data revenue declining to around 
8%-9% of Eutelsat's total revenue by 2022.

EBITDA Stabilisation: It is likely that the decline in Eutelsat's EBITDA (5.3% 
in FY17/18) will stabilise over the next 12 to 18 months. Declines have 
predominantly been driven by revenue pressures in all segments. Data segment 
pressures are likely to remain in the short term, but a combination of stable 
video segment performance, revenue stabilisation in the government sector, cost 
reductions and gradually improving transponder utilisation rates should enable 
the company to stabilise its EBITDA.

Technology Risks Unlikely in Medium Term: The deployment of fibre-based, 
terrestrial broadband networks, growth of over-the-top (OTT) applications and 
the development of new compression technologies for transmission are risks to 
fixed satellite operators and the video segment. However, Fitch believes that 
the impact from these trends over the next four to five years is likely to be 
minimal. This is due to a combination of the compelling economics of video 
distribution via satellite, the gradual and partial deployment of fibre 
networks, the slow adoption of compression technologies, such as high efficiency 
video coding (HEVC), and off-setting growth from increasing channels and HD 
penetration.

Improving Financial Flexibility: Eutelsat's funds from operations (FFO) adjusted 
net leverage improved by 0.1x to 3.6x in FY17/18. The improvement was driven by 
exceptional Hispasat disposal proceeds, lower capex intensity and retained FCF. 
Strong and stable pre-dividend FCF generation with margins estimated to be 
around 32% over the next three years, are likely to provide the company with the 
ability to gradually improve its leverage on an organic basis by around 0.1x a 
year. The company's dividend policy targets a stable to progressive dividend, 
which we believe provides scope for Eutelsat to retain FCF for investment and 
financial flexibility if needed.

Structural Subordination of Holding Company: At end-June 2018, Eutelsat had 
Fitch-defined total gross debt of EUR3,965 million, of which  EUR600 million was 
issued by itself and the remainder by subsidiary, Eutelsat S.A. As there are no 
guarantees between the parent and subsidiary, the amount of debt issued by 
Eutelsat  S.A., which is greater than 2.5x EBITDA, leads to structural 
subordination of the debt issued by Eutelsat. Under Fitch's methodology, debt 
issued by Eutelsat would be rated lower than the debt issued by Eutelsat S.A.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Eutelsat has a hybrid credit profile with a strong ability to sustain leverage. 
The hybrid profile reflects reasonably good revenue visibility based on long 
contract durations in the video segment, a cash-generative business model and 
barriers to entry from regulated orbital positions. This is offset by risks 
related to technology-driven increases in industry capacity, obsolescence and 
substitution. Eutelsat effectively manages such risks through a measured 
financial policy and financial flexibility. 

The profile enables Eutelsat to sustain leverage at similar levels to large, 
diversified European telecoms operators such as Vodafone Group Plc 
(BBB+/Stable), Orange SA (BBB+/Stable) and Deutsche Telekom A.G. (BBB+/Stable) 
and telecoms wholesale infrastructure providers such as Ceska telekomunikacni 
infrastruktura a.s. (BBB/Stable). However, its profile is slightly weaker than 
peers with similar hybrid credit profiles such as mobile towers operators 
Cellnex Telecom SA (BBB-/Negative) and data centre operators such as Global 
Switch Holdings Limited (BBB+/Stable) due to their longer contract durations, 
lower technology exposure and greater discretionary organic deleveraging 
capacity.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

 Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer

- Revenues to decline by 1% in 2019, then stabilise until 2022. 

- EBITDA margin improvement to 77.3% in 2019. 

- Capex, based on the company's definition of around EUR400 million per year 
until 2022. 

- Dividends to increase by 5% per year until 2022. 

- No M&A activity. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

- FFO adjusted net leverage falling sustainably below 3.5x. 

- Visibility that revenue and cash flow will not be adversely impacted by 
changes in sector trends and market structure. 

Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- FFO adjusted net leverage remaining above 4.0x (corresponding to approximate 
net debt/EBITDA of 3.3x) on a sustained basis.

- Significant pressure on FCF driven by EBITDA erosion as a result of pricing 
pressure, protracted contraction of segments, increasing global overcapacity or 
new competitive entrants, along with higher-than-expected capital intensity and 
shareholder remunerations.

LIQUIDITY

Strong Liquidity: Eutelsat benefits from a comfortable liquidity position with 
balance sheet cash of EUR734 million as at June 2018, positive FCF generation 
ranging between EUR110 million and EUR175 million across our rating horizon and 
EUR650 million of undrawn committed facilities maturing in 2023. This compares 
favourably with a well-spread debt maturity profile.

 (Adds detail, CEO comment, updates shares)
    By James Davey
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Tesco <TSCO.L> shares fell 8
percent after Britain's biggest retailer missed first-half
profit forecasts as weak trading in Thailand and Poland eclipsed
accelerating sales growth in its main UK business.
    The supermarket group, being rebuilt by Chief Executive Dave
Lewis following a 2014 accounting scandal, unsettled investors
as problems abroad compounded fears that already brutal
competition in its home market would further intensify with the
planned merger of its two closest rivals -- Sainsbury's <SBRY.L>
and Asda <WMT.N>.
    Tesco, which said it was ""firmly on track"" to meet its
medium-term targets, reported underlying operating profit of 933
million pounds ($1.21 billion) - up 24 percent on last year but
short of analysts' average forecast of 978 million pounds.
    Profit fell 29.1 percent in Asia and by 3.3 percent in
central Europe, partly offsetting growth of 47.6 percent in the
UK and Ireland where the 3.7 billion pound acquisition of
wholesaler Booker has allowed Tesco to expand to provide food to
restaurants, bars and smaller grocers.
    Shares in Tesco, up 12 percent this year prior to the
update, slumped 7.9 percent by 1420 GMT, on course for the
biggest one-day drop since Sept. 2014.
    Chief Financial Officer Alan Stewart told reporters analysts
had failed to fully factor in problems in Thailand, while Lewis
was unperturbed by the share price fall.
    ""The market will decide what it wants to decide,"" he said.
    ""There’s been lots and lots of pots in the road as we’ve
gone over the last three and a half years, this is one of the
things that we’re working through,” he said, adding that total
group first half sales up over 12 percent and profit up over 24
percent was ""bang in line with where we wanted to be.""
    
    FACING CHALLENGES
    Lewis, a former Unilever executive, has been steering a
steady recovery after the accounting scandal capped a dramatic
downturn in trading.
    He has lowered Tesco's prices versus all its major
competitors, streamlined product ranges and improved their
quality, while raising store standards and transforming
relationships with suppliers.
    Lewis has also pursued new growth avenues. In addition to
the Booker deal he has formed a global purchasing alliance with
France's Carrefour <CARR.PA> and launched a new discount format
called Jack's. [nL5N1QN17V] [nL8N1TY0TM] [nL8N1W526I]
    Analysts said the results showed Tesco was performing well
in the core UK and Ireland division, which contributes nearly
three quarters of group profit, but that challenges, including
from Brexit, lie ahead.
    Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said
revenues, profits and debt were all heading in the right
direction, but margins were not improving as quickly as hoped.  
    ""The acquisition of Booker is progressing well, and a recent
buying agreement with ... Carrefour will give Tesco extra muscle
in a market where it may soon face the combined power of
Sainsbury’s and Asda,"" he said. 
    Tesco has a leading 27.4 percent share of Britain's 200
billion pound grocery market, according to industry data,
although it could be overtaken by Sainsbury's proposed 7.3
billion pound takeover of Walmart's Asda. [nL8N1W41LJ]
    That tie-up, which the regulator is probing, is driven in
part by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, who are gaining
ground on Britain's big four grocers, as well as the growth of
Amazon. [nL8N1WD44F]
    On Monday Aldi raised its UK stores target to 1,200 by 2025.
[nL8N1WH0XW]
    
    THAILAND AND POLAND      
    In Asia second quarter like-for-like sales fell 4.8 percent,
reflecting Tesco's decision to exit non-profitable cash and
carry sales in Thailand, the impact of the Thai government
issuing welfare cards which cannot be redeemed in Tesco stores
and Tesco's own price cuts.
    Underlying sales in the Central Europe division fell 2.0
percent, reflecting weak sales in Poland, where changes to
Sunday trading regulations resulted in 13 fewer trading days.
    Lewis said Tesco was committed to both Thailand and Poland,
though he did not rule out a possible future exit from the
latter. [nL9N1SV016]
    Tesco is market leader in Thailand, which has the group's
best profit margins. But Tesco only has a 4 percent market share
in Poland and it is the group's only loss-making business.
    Asked if he would consider a disposal Lewis said: ""I'm a
very commercially rational businessman.""
    Lewis said the difficulties in Thailand and Poland did not
imperil Tesco's key margin target for the group to earn between
3.5 and 4 pence of operating profit for every pound customers
spend by the end of its 2019-20 financial year.
    Analysts at Barclays maintained their ""overweight"" stance on
Tesco but cut their 2018-19 operating profit forecast for Tesco
by about 3 percent to 2.06 billion pounds.
    Tesco held its own in a strong summer for Britain's overall
grocery industry which was boosted by record hot weather, a
royal wedding and the soccer World Cup, delivering a 2.5 percent
increase in second quarter like-for-like sales - an eleventh
straight quarter of growth.

170,983,cf618830e6b4dfd9311f9e876e851b94,COLUMN-Market 'discipline' on Italy? Be careful what you wish for: McGeever,2018-10-03 22:43:04,EUR,0.51841,2018-10-03 22:43:36,"{'EUR': 'Neutral', 'JPY': 'Negative', 'GBP': 'Negative'}"," (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a
columnist for Reuters.)
    By Jamie McGeever
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The new Italian government's
latest budget proposals have caused consternation in markets and
irritation in Brussels - yet many at the heart of euro
policymaking will quietly feel a dose of market discipline is a
precisely what's needed to rein Rome in.
    Let the bond vigilantes loose, is how thinking goes. A surge
in Italian government borrowing costs and steep drop in the
country's banking stocks have the power to change even the most
ambitious budget mathematics and force Italy's coalition leaders
to roll back their plans.
    ""If they do crazy things, let the market play its role.
Market discipline exists, as we have seen,"" one policymaker put
it recently.
    Sounds good in theory. But it may also be a case of ""careful
what you wish for"". At what point does market discipline in
Italy and its related political fallout infect the rest of the
euro area and undermine the single currency? 
    A paper by Guido Tabellini, professor of economics at
Bocconi University, published by the Centre for Economic Policy
Research in July, found that efforts to impose market discipline
work ""very imperfectly"", even if the economic fundamentals are
relatively sound.
    ""The larger the outstanding debt, the higher the risk that
market discipline degenerates into a debt run,"" Tabellini wrote,
and a crisis of confidence in one euro zone country was likely
to spread to others. 
    ""The resilience of the euro area is not much higher than
that of its weakest member. For this reason, reforms that
increase the vulnerabilities of the weaker countries may be
counter-productive for all,"" he found.
    Italy's economic fundamentals are not particularly sound,
and its outstanding debt is huge. While there's been relatively
little spillover to date from the turmoil in Italian markets,
the recent history of euro crises shows it's dangerous to assume
that will remain the case indefinitely.
    The scars of 2010-2012 are healing but run deep. 
    Greece - with an economy almost a tenth the size of Italy's
- was the epicentre of that euro crisis. And yet the financial
contagion associated with risk of an unprecedented euro exit
ripped through Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal - eventually
forcing ECB president Mario Draghi to do ""whatever it takes"" and
fire up the bank's money printing presses to calm the storm.
    Italian bond yields hit 7.45 percent in 2011 and the spread
over Germany topped 550 basis points. We're not back there yet,
but the 10-year yield is near 3.50 percent and the spread over
Germany is 300 bps, both the highest in years.
    Since Italy's general election in May, the country's stock
market has lost 18 percent and bank stocks have plunged 30
percent. Wider contagion has been pretty limited, but at this
stage it cannot be blindly dismissed.
    
    SPILLOVER
    Goldman Sachs has constructed a model that shows that since
2010, on days when there's been an equivalent 100 bps rise in
Italian yields, Spanish yields rise by around 40 bps, while
safe-haven flows push German yields down by around 20 bps.
    In equities, this results in Spanish, French and German
markets falling 3.5 to 5 percent, and U.S., UK and Japanese
stocks falling between 2 and 3 percent. 
    More broadly, Spanish financial conditions tighten by around
40 bps, and U.S., UK and Japanese conditions tighten by around
20 bps. Thanks to the fall in the euro's exchange rate and Bund
yields, German financial conditions ease by around 15 bps.
    
    
    
    
    Spillovers in the 2010-13 period were obviously greater than
the years since, but the analysis shows that meaningful moves in
Italian bonds do move other markets. Some more than others.
    Given how heavily invested Italian banks are in the
country's sovereign bonds, the correlation between BTP futures
and euro zone banking stocks is particularly strong.
    This week, the simple daily correlation between the two
reached 0.76, matching levels seen in May and closing in on the
crisis peaks of 0.85 to 0.90 in 2011 and 2012. The highest
possible correlation between two asset classes or markets is
1.0.
    

    At the root of the current volatility is the budget standoff
between Rome and Brussels. Italian government sources told
Reuters on Wednesday that next year's deficit target remains 2.4
percent of gross domestic product, falling to 2 percent in 2021,
maybe even lower. 
    But growth in Italy has been chronically low for years,
nowhere near strong enough to prevent the country's debt-to-GDP
ratio from rising. Are these forecasts enough to bring the ratio
down to a rate acceptable to Brussels? 
    Punishment from Brussels over the deficit might not keep
Italian politicians up at night, but market forces would. Rising
bond yields would damage growth even more, and the perfect storm
of weak growth and higher debt funding costs could push the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 130 pct even higher. 
    That would bring the rating agencies back into play. Italy
could be downgraded, maybe even by three notches to junk. ""The
wider connotations of falling down this path don't bear thinking
about,"" says Steve Barrow at Standard Bank.

    NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Honda is buying a
stake in GM’s autonomous vehicle unit. Daimler and
Renault-Nissan may cooperate more on Autos 2.0. Joint ventures
help with costs, but are tricky to run. Full-blown mergers,
advocated by late Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne, make
longer-term sense.

    CONTEXT NEWS 
    - Honda is investing $750 million in General Motors’
autonomous-vehicle unit, Cruise, the companies said on Oct. 3.
The Japanese automaker will own roughly 6 percent of Cruise and
has also committed to contribute around $2 billion to
development costs over the next 12 years. The move values the
division at $14.6 billion and follows SoftBank taking a 20
percent stake in May for $2 billion.
    - In a joint press briefing in Paris on Oct. 3, Daimler boss
Dieter Zetsche and Renault Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn
said they may expand their cooperation to include electric and
autonomous vehicles.

    LONDON, Oct 3(Reuters) - The British pound briefly fell
towards a three-week low on Wednesday as Prime Minister Theresa
May defended her plans for Brexit, although the currency's moves
were limited as analysts said they saw little in her speech that
was new. 
    May said she was confident Britain could agree a deal for
its exit from the European Union, although she said she would
rather leave without a deal than accept the carve up of the
United Kingdom. [nS8N1JB029]
    Sterling was weaker before May delivered her annual speech
to the Conservative Party conference, but it did briefly slip
further after she pledged to stick with her Brexit plans as
Britain and the EU enter another round of negotiations to decide
their split..
    ""In between dancing onto stage and criticising the Labour
Party, there was little fresh rhetoric today from Theresa May on
her stance on Brexit. The market reaction was muted, and despite
a small wobble, the pound’s response was not as pronounced as we
have seen in the last few weeks,"" said Hamish Muress, currency
analyst at OFX.
    The pound dropped 0.4 percent on the day to as low as
$1.2963 <GBP=D3>, close to Tuesday's three-week low of $1.2941,
before recovering to trade down 0.1 percent at $1.2994. 
    Sterling was unmoved versus the euro at 88.995 pence
<EURGBP=D3> during May's speech but later rallied 0.4 percent to
88.67 pence, pushed higher by a broad weakening in the single
currency. 
    The currency has been hit hard by concerns over a growing
conflict within her party over May's Brexit plan with the pound
falling to its lowest since Sept. 10 in the previous session. 
    Analysts said there was little to excite currency traders in
May's speech, with attention shifting to the next phase of talks
with Brussels. 
    ""Nothing new of substance on Brexit... $GBP markets now
looking to upcoming Brexit talks. Most interesting thing may be
'end to austerity' preview of a slightly more expansionary UK
budget,"" Viraj Patel, an analyst at ING, said on Twitter,
referring to May's announcement of an end to a decade of cuts to
British public service spending.
    Earlier on Wednesday, a business survey showed Britain's
services sector kept up its steady growth in September but
uncertainty about the economy remained high six months ahead of
Brexit. The currency was little moved. [nS8N1V7041]

economy
    * Trade sanctions would mark tougher EU line over Rohingya
crisis

    By Robin Emmott and Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European Union is
considering trade sanctions on Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis,
potentially stripping the country of tariff-free access to the
world's largest trading bloc, three EU officials said.
    The sanctions, under discussion at the European Commission,
would include Myanmar's lucrative textile industry and
potentially put at risk thousands of jobs there but would not
come into effect immediately, giving the EU leverage to stop
what the West says is ethnic cleansing of Muslim Rohingya. 
    Even by triggering a six-month review process on whether to
impose trade sanctions, which could be reversed if Myanmar met
humanitarian and democratic targets, the bloc would mark a
significant shift in policy.
    The impetus for the move was a U.N. report in August, which
accused Myanmar's military of carrying out killings of Rohingya
with ""genocidal intent"". That, and the rare U.S. step of putting
sanctions on two entire military units, have put an onus on the
European Union to act, officials said.
    ""We are concerned about the impact on the population from
our potential measures, but we cannot ignore a U.N. report
describing the military campaign as genocide,"" said one EU
official of the debate within the European Commission, the EU
executive responsible for the bloc's trade policy.
    Until now, the EU has imposed travel bans and asset freezes
on several members of the Myanmar military, but has shied away
from slapping sanctions on Myanmar's commander-in-chief, Senior
General Min Aung Hlaing, who the United Nations said should be
prosecuted along with five others for genocide and crimes
against humanity.
    Myanmar has rejected the U.N. findings as ""one-sided"". It
says military action which followed militant attacks on security
forces in August last year was a legitimate counterinsurgency
operation.
    Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer
telephone calls seeking comment on the possible EU move on
Wednesday. He said last month he would no longer speak to the
media over the phone, only at a biweekly conference.
    EU officials believe the formal threat of losing tariff-free
access would quickly hit foreign investment in the apparel
industry, where European manufacturers take advantage of
relatively low labour costs in Myanmar.
    ""Removing this duty-free access is a measure of last resort,
but we must act if other measures are not delivering,"" said one
EU official involved in the discussions.
    ""In light of the deteriorating situation on the ground, the
Commission is currently assessing possible ways of escalating
its political and economic response,"" a Commission source said.
    European firms sourcing apparel from Myanmar include
retailers Adidas, C&A, H&M, Inditex, Next and Primark.
    Rights groups say the targeted EU sanctions so far have not
forced the military or civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to
protect civilians, resettle refugees or stop attacks on press
freedoms that have included the imprisonment of two Reuters
reporters for breaching a law on state secrets. [nL3N1VD38V]
    The European Parliament last month called for the Commission
to review Myanmar's trade preferences.
    
    SIXTH-LARGEST TRADE PARTNER 
    Within the Commission there are differences, with the EU
Trade Chief Cecilia Malmstrom leaning towards starting the
process of imposing trade sanctions while the EU's top diplomat
Federica Mogherini is more cautious because of EU policy to
avoid economic sanctions that can hurt ordinary citizens, the
officials said.
    Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has yet to take a
position, they said. A Commission spokesman declined to comment.
    Myanmar's exports to the European Union were worth 1.56
billion euros ($1.81 billion) in 2017, nearly 10 times their
value in 2012, after which the bloc gave Myanmar ""Everything But
Arms"" trade status.
    That status means it can sell any goods tariff-free to the
bloc, except weapons. The EU is Myanmar's sixth-largest trading
partner and an important source of foreign direct investment.
    Mynamar's clothing industry is its top export earner after
oil and gas, generating more than $2 billion in exports and
450,000 jobs last year, according to industry association MGMA.
    Trade sanctions would end an economic opening granted to
support Myanmar's transition to democracy after Suu Kyi emerged
from 15 years of house arrest under military rule and led her
party to take both the parliament and the presidency.
    One more limited option for the EU could be to exempt
textiles, an official said, but given the size of the sector,
that would significantly reduce the impact of EU sanctions.
Clothing and footwear are worth more than three-quarters of
Myanmar's exports to the bloc.
    Both the United States and the European Union want to spur
economic development to underpin democracy and diminish China's
influence. Crushing the economy with trade sanctions could allow
China to dominate Myanmar, officials said.
    Washington imposed sanctions on four military and police
commanders and two army units in August. New sanctions are under
consideration for half a dozen other individuals and at least
two military-run businesses, U.S. officials have said. 
    A U.S. State Department report released last week accused
Myanmar's military of waging a ""well-planned and coordinated""
campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities
against the Rohingya, but stopped short of calling it genocide
or crimes against humanity. 
    Senior State Department officials told Reuters, however,
that those findings could be used to justify further targeted
U.S. sanctions or other punitive measures.
    There appears to be little U.S. appetite, though, for
re-imposing broad economic sanctions lifted by former President
Barack Obama as the country shifted from decades of direct
military rule toward a democratic transition.
    Some European companies have already cut business with
Myanmar, with Cartier stopping purchasing gemstones from the
country on Dec. 8, 2017, citing abuses against the Rohingyas.

self-driving and electric vehicles is prompting carmakers to
car-pool. Honda <7267.T> on Wednesday took a stake in General

presentation called ""Confessions of a Capital Junkie,"" if the
industry consolidated.
    The costs of producing the car of the future reinforce that.
The major vehicle manufacturers have committed more than $100
billion over the next decade to developing electric batteries.
They don’t all say how much they’re spending on self-driving
technologies, but it’s reasonable to assume there is plenty of
duplication of effort – and cost. The race to secure essential
battery resources like lithium and cobalt will only intensify,
too.
    Joint ventures can be a handy way to trim expenses. But they
are tricky to run, and the existential challenge of getting
autonomous cars right means there are lots of drivers trying to
get their hands on the wheel. Take Renault-Nissan. The
Franco-Japanese outfit recently added Mitsubishi <7211.T> to its
alliance. It has worked in the past with Daimler, which now
counts Chinese carmaker Geely [GEELY.UL] among its shareholders.
The French government and German labor unions add their own
perspective on how to get things done.
    GM’s Cruise is in a better position. It’s clearly in the
driver’s seat; Honda has only around a 6 percent stake in the
$14.6 billion joint venture. The venture is also further ahead
than many others, battling it out with Alphabet’s <GOOGL.O>
Waymo for leadership. It even expects to have some robo-taxis on
the streets of some U.S. cities next year.
    Marchionne’s rivals ignored his call for consolidation; many
privately accept the logic but aren’t willing to cede control.
If the current crop of looser alliances to develop autonomous
and electric vehicles doesn’t yield enough power soon, the
former Fiat Chrysler chief’s dream may become a reality.

    CONTEXT NEWS 
    - Honda is investing $750 million in General Motors’
autonomous-vehicle unit, Cruise, the companies said on Oct. 3.
The Japanese automaker will own roughly 6 percent of Cruise and
has also committed to contribute around $2 billion to
development costs over the next 12 years. The move values the
division at $14.6 billion and follows SoftBank <9984.T> taking a
20 percent stake in May for $2 billion.
    - In a joint press briefing in Paris on Oct. 3, Daimler boss
Dieter Zetsche and Renault-Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn
said they may expand their cooperation to include electric and
autonomous vehicles.

    By Giuseppe Fonte and Alberto Sisto
    ROME, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy will cut its budget deficit
targets from 2020 and reduce its debt over the next three years,
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday, easing fears
about fiscal policy in the euro zone's third-biggest economy.
    The ruling coalition last week stunned investors by tripling
Italy's previous deficit target for the 2019-21 period to pay
for tax cuts, welfare for the poor and a planned revision of an
unpopular pension reform.
    Speaking to reporters after a meeting of ministers, Conte
said the government would push ahead with its expansionist
fiscal programme but would keep its spending in check.
    ""We will show courage above all in 2019, because we believe
that our country needs a budget that calls for strong growth,""
said Conte, flanked by deputy prime ministers Luigi Di Maio and
Matteo Salvini, and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria.
    Conte confirmed a deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and said this would fall to 2.1
percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021. 
    He predicted the debt/GDP ratio would fall beneath 130
percent next year and hit 126.5 percent by 2021. It is currently
around 131 percent, the second highest in Europe after Greece.
    The government did not release growth targets, but Tria said
the gap between Italian growth and the rest of the eurozone
would halve next year. The IMF has forecast growth of 1.0
percent in Italy in 2019 against 1.9 percent for the eurozone.
    News the coalition planned to cut the deficit faster than
previously indicated caused Italian government bond yields to
fall sharply on Wednesday, [nL8N1WJ0V5] while the Milan bourse
outperformed other major stock exchanges in Europe to close up
0.9 percent. [nL8N1WJ1H1]
 
    INVESTMENTS
    The coalition came to power in June promising to slash taxes
and boost welfare spending, and says an expansionary budget is
needed to lift Italy's underperforming economy, which is some
six percent smaller than it was a decade ago before the
sovereign debt-crisis exploded.
    Tria said the 2019 budget would include a lift in public
investment and would offer tax breaks to firms investing in
equipment and staff. The jobless rate would fall from around 10
percent now to as low as 7 percent, the prime minister said.
    European Commission officials and EU allies had expressed
their concern over Rome's spending plans and there was some
relief over the reduced targets.
    ""It's a good signal that the trajectory has been revised
because it shows the Italian authorities are hearing the
concerns and remarks from their partners and the European
Commission,"" EU Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said in Paris.
[nL8N1WJ3K2]
    Italy's minister for European affairs, Paolo Savona, went to
Strasbourg on Wednesday to try to reassure EU lawmakers that
Rome was not being irresponsible. [nL8N1WJ4Y9]
    ""I think there is no chance that Italy will default on its
public debt,"" said Savona, who has previously called into
question Italy's membership of the euro currency. 
    ""I do not intend to take any action against the euro. On the
contrary, I want to strengthen it,"" he said on Wednesday.

    By Jamie McGeever
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The new Italian government's
latest budget proposals have caused consternation in markets and
irritation in Brussels - yet many at the heart of euro
policymaking will quietly feel a dose of market discipline is a
precisely what's needed to rein Rome in.
    Let the bond vigilantes loose, is how thinking goes. A surge
in Italian government borrowing costs and steep drop in the
country's banking stocks have the power to change even the most
ambitious budget mathematics and force Italy's coalition leaders
to roll back their plans.
    ""If they do crazy things, let the market play its role.
Market discipline exists, as we have seen,"" one policymaker put
it recently.
    Sounds good in theory. But it may also be a case of ""careful
what you wish for"". At what point does market discipline in
Italy and its related political fallout infect the rest of the
euro area and undermine the single currency? 
    A paper by Guido Tabellini, professor of economics at
Bocconi University, published by the Centre for Economic Policy
Research in July, found that efforts to impose market discipline
work ""very imperfectly"", even if the economic fundamentals are
relatively sound.
    ""The larger the outstanding debt, the higher the risk that
market discipline degenerates into a debt run,"" Tabellini wrote,
and a crisis of confidence in one euro zone country was likely
to spread to others. 
    ""The resilience of the euro area is not much higher than
that of its weakest member. For this reason, reforms that
increase the vulnerabilities of the weaker countries may be
counter-productive for all,"" he found.
    Italy's economic fundamentals are not particularly sound,
and its outstanding debt is huge. While there's been relatively
little spillover to date from the turmoil in Italian markets,
the recent history of euro crises shows it's dangerous to assume
that will remain the case indefinitely.
    The scars of 2010-2012 are healing but run deep. 
    Greece - with an economy almost a tenth the size of Italy's
- was the epicentre of that euro crisis. And yet the financial
contagion associated with risk of an unprecedented euro exit
ripped through Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal - eventually
forcing ECB president Mario Draghi to do ""whatever it takes"" and
fire up the bank's money printing presses to calm the storm.
    Italian bond yields hit 7.45 percent in 2011 and the spread
over Germany topped 550 basis points. We're not back there yet,
but the 10-year yield is near 3.50 percent and the spread over
Germany is 300 bps, both the highest in years.
    Since Italy's general election in May, the country's stock
market has lost 18 percent and bank stocks have plunged 30
percent. Wider contagion has been pretty limited, but at this
stage it cannot be blindly dismissed.
    
    SPILLOVER
    Goldman Sachs has constructed a model that shows that since
2010, on days when there's been an equivalent 100 bps rise in
Italian yields, Spanish yields rise by around 40 bps, while
safe-haven flows push German yields down by around 20 bps.
    In equities, this results in Spanish, French and German
markets falling 3.5 to 5 percent, and U.S., UK and Japanese
stocks falling between 2 and 3 percent. 
    More broadly, Spanish financial conditions tighten by around
40 bps, and U.S., UK and Japanese conditions tighten by around
20 bps. Thanks to the fall in the euro's exchange rate and Bund
yields, German financial conditions ease by around 15 bps.
    
    
    
    
    Spillovers in the 2010-13 period were obviously greater than
the years since, but the analysis shows that meaningful moves in
Italian bonds do move other markets. Some more than others.
    Given how heavily invested Italian banks are in the
country's sovereign bonds, the correlation between BTP futures
and euro zone banking stocks is particularly strong.
    This week, the simple daily correlation between the two
reached 0.76, matching levels seen in May and closing in on the
crisis peaks of 0.85 to 0.90 in 2011 and 2012. The highest
possible correlation between two asset classes or markets is
1.0.
    

    At the root of the current volatility is the budget standoff
between Rome and Brussels. Italian government sources told
Reuters on Wednesday that next year's deficit target remains 2.4
percent of gross domestic product, falling to 2 percent in 2021,
maybe even lower. 
    But growth in Italy has been chronically low for years,
nowhere near strong enough to prevent the country's debt-to-GDP
ratio from rising. Are these forecasts enough to bring the ratio
down to a rate acceptable to Brussels? 
    Punishment from Brussels over the deficit might not keep
Italian politicians up at night, but market forces would. Rising
bond yields would damage growth even more, and the perfect storm
of weak growth and higher debt funding costs could push the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 130 pct even higher. 
    That would bring the rating agencies back into play. Italy
could be downgraded, maybe even by three notches to junk. ""The
wider connotations of falling down this path don't bear thinking
about,"" says Steve Barrow at Standard Bank.

    By Hari Kishan
    BENGALURU, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The euro will withstand the
latest political turmoil in Italy and any short-term spill will
be limited, but it may be another six months before the dominant
dollar trade is swept aside, according to a Reuters poll of
currency strategists.
    After its best run since 2003 last year, the single currency
is down close to 4 percent so far in 2018, driven mainly by
increasing bets in favour of the dollar on solid U.S. economic
performance and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening path.
    Markets recently have been unnerved by the uncertainty
surrounding Italy's debt pile, fiscal plans and future ties with
Europe, which pushed the single currency to a six-week low of
$1.1504 against the dollar on Tuesday. [nL8N1WI4KW]
    But the latest poll of over 70 strategists taken Sept 28-Oct
3 forecast the euro <EUR=> to trade higher at $1.16 in three
months from around $1.15 on Wednesday. It was then expected to
rise to $1.22 in a year, about a six percent rise from here.
    ""We feel that a lot of bad news is already priced into
Italian assets - including a Moody's downgrade - and hence see
the balance of risks tilted towards the euro moving higher from
here as some of the markets' worst fears are shelved,"" noted
Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
    The single currency is expected to fall at most by only one
percent to a low of $1.14 at some point over the next three
months, according to the median of 30 strategists who answered
an additional question. But that would still be comfortably
above a 13-month low of $1.1297 hit in August.
    ""For the euro to move well below $1.1500 and back down
towards the previous lows...we would really need to see the
Italian debt situation escalate significantly from here and
challenge the sustainability of the euro zone and euro going
forward,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG.
    ""That is not our base case scenario. But obviously if we
reach that kind of a crisis scenario, all bets are off, because
it will be going a lot lower.""
    
    LESS BACKING FOR GREENBACK IN 2019
    While currency speculators increased their bets in favour of
the dollar for the second week in a row, strategists in the
latest Reuters poll were almost evenly split on whether the
greenback's rally has already stalled. [nL2N1WE1SB]
    A majority of strategists who answered a separate question
said the U.S. dollar's dominance will last only another three
months or six most.
    With several of the factors that have helped the dollar
rally expected to fade soon, most major currencies are forecast
to gain in a year.
    
    
    ""It might run up a little bit further for a couple of months
on the emerging markets side, but the dollar versus major
currencies is starting to peak,"" said Gavin Friend, senior
markets strategist at NAB.
    ""Markets are getting more interested in the end of the U.S.
(tightening) cycle, which has been almost fully priced in.""
    Against the dollar, sterling was forecast to strengthen by
the time Britain leaves the European Union. But over the coming
year it was not expected to regain its losses since the shock
Brexit vote in 2016. [GBP/POLL]
    ""Our basic assumption is that we think the EU and the UK
will eventually reach a Brexit deal. At this stage, it is still
highly uncertain how they get to that kind of end-point of a
deal. The pound could yet weaken further before a deal is
reached,"" added Hardman.
    ""But we still think that overall, a deal is more likely as
both sides want to avoid a no-deal scenario. That should result
in the pound strengthening notably.""

    By Ross Finley
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The pound is set to be stronger by
the time Britain leaves the European Union, according to
currency strategists polled by Reuters, but in a year it still
won't have come close to recouping its losses since the shock
2016 Brexit vote.
    Sterling is due to edge up more than 2 percent against the
dollar in six months - just after the March 29, 2019 date when
it is scheduled to leave - to around $1.33.
    It is then set to climb to $1.37 six months later, according
to the poll, taken Sept 28-Oct 3, before Prime Minister Theresa
May's Conservative Party conference speech on Wednesday.
[nL8N1WJ1NV]  
    Forecast ranges in the survey were wide, particularly on the
12-month horizon. But just two out of 64 forecasters said the
pound would trade higher than where it was before the shock
result in the June 2016 referendum at around $1.50.
    The 12-month consensus has fallen along with the pound since
the April poll, which was the first time forecasts for where
sterling will be after the official leaving date were collected.
Nearly every strategist has downgraded their view since then.
    That latest median 12-month view has the pound languishing
about 9 percent below $1.50. More than two years ago, just
before the referendum, respondents correctly predicted in the
Reuters foreign exchange poll that sterling would fall by about
that much immediately afterward.
    So the view that Britain leaving the EU will result in a
lasting, not temporary, devaluation appears to be holding. Trade
and industry data show that depreciation has done relatively
little to boost exports or make Britain more competitive in the
meantime.
    For there to be any recovery in the pound from the current
rate, around $1.30, most foreign exchange analysts say there
will need to be positive developments on the terms under which
Britain will leave the world's largest trading bloc.
    With the Bank of England set to keep interest rates on hold
in the interim and mixed signals on economic performance, a
steadily-widening gap between UK rates and the U.S. federal
funds rate will also keep pressure on sterling. 
    
    
    Still, over 80 percent of strategists polled say sterling
will be higher in a year than where it is trading now. Optimists
say there's a lot of bad news - including talk of a ""no-deal""
Brexit - already priced in.
    ""Indeed, the negatives surrounding deadlock Brexit
negotiations and the UK government's Chequers plan are largely
priced into the currency,"" notes Viraj Patel, FX strategist at
ING in London. 
    Chequers, Prime Minister Theresa May's exit proposal that
proposes to stay in the EU's single market in goods but to
diverge in services, is unpopular in her own party. European
Council President Donald Tusk says it ""will not work."" 
    In order for the pound to recover significantly, there will
also need to be decidedly more negative prospects for the U.S.
dollar, which right now is standing tall as near-term prospects
for the world's largest economy look better than its peers.
    The last time sterling rallied in the period since the
Brexit vote, which took it above $1.43 and left many
commentators scratching their heads at the time, coincided with
what turned out to be a passing weak period for the dollar.
    ""Political risks like Brexit and U.S. trade disputes should
continue to favor the USD over the GBP for the next three
months,"" note market strategists at UBS. ""A GBP rebound over 12
months remains possible, however. We still expect a benign
outcome for Brexit negotiations, but the risk of a cliff-edge
Brexit remains significant.""
    There does not appear to be much confidence about how
sterling will perform in the near-term either.
    Asked to gauge the risk that the pound will set a new
post-Brexit low against the dollar before the end of March 2019,
respondents were evenly split. The lowest point reached so far
was just above $1.20 in early 2017.
    Against the euro, the outlook for the pound is once again
very subdued, with narrow forecast ranges.
    Prospects for a decline against the currency of Britain's
main trading partner have recently been held in check as traders
fretted over a stand-off between the Italian government and the
European Commission over the size of Italy's budget
deficit.[nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But the same Reuters poll found the euro is expected to be
resilient in coming months. [EUR/POLL]

    By Terje Solsvik
    OSLO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sweden's and Norway's currencies
will gain against the euro and dollar over the next 12 months, a
Reuters poll forecast on Thursday, with interest rate increases
likely in both countries.
    After years of weakness driven by ultra-loose monetary
policy and, more recently, fears of global trade wars, the two
Nordic currencies in September showed signs of recovery, each
rallying close to 3 percent against the euro.
    Norway on Sept. 20 raised its key policy rate for the first
time in seven years, to 0.75 percent from a record low 0.50
percent. It plans additional increases in 2019 and beyond,
albeit at a still-moderate pace [nL8N1W61PV][nL8N1WB2EO].
    Also boosted by a surge in the price of North Sea crude,
Norway's main export, the Norwegian crown on Oct. 1 hit a
13-month peak against a broad basket of trade-weighted
currencies, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.
    The stronger sentiment has led speculators to cut their
short positions on the Norwegian crown, brokerage DNB Markets
said, while cautioning that risk aversion would probably still
limit the currency's strength.
    ""The Norwegian crown will strengthen moderately as the
difference in rates between Norway and trading partners in the
euro zone grows,"" DNB Chief Economist Kjersti Haugland said.
    ""We still see traces of reluctance (to hold the currency)
among investors, though, as the global picture remains
uncertain,"" she added.
    In Sweden, the Riksbank on Sept. 6 left the repo rate
unchanged at a negative 0.50 percent, but signalled its first
rate hike since 2011 could come by February of next year.
[nL5N1VS1PV][nL8N1W31ID].
    The country's recent election, which delivered a hung
parliament and no clear path to the formation of a viable
government, should be of less concern to investors, DNB's
Haugland said.
    ""We expect a rate hike in February, and thus also a stronger
crown. The currency is very weak at the moment, and there's room
for reversal to better reflect the economic strength. We don't
buy the argument that the election will impact the economy,"" she
said.
    Sweden's currency is expected to strengthen nearly 4 percent
from current levels in the next 12 months to 9.98 against the
euro. Norway's crown will strengthen over 3 percent to 9.15 per
euro, the Reuters poll of over 35 economists predicted.
    Against the dollar, the Norwegian crown is expected to
strengthen nearly 8 percent to 7.54 in the next 12 months, while
the Swedish currency is expected to rise nearly 11 percent to
8.06, the poll predicted.

lawmakers within two weeks of signing the terms of the divorce

    Under that timetable, members of Parliament would vote on

she has so far weathered the Brexit storm, shrugging off a

that did little to hide his leadership ambitions.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: BANKS, IPO ACTIVITY, UK RETAILERS (0643 GMT)
    European shares are set to open lower today as markets reprice expectations for a rate hike
in the U.S and monitor development in Rome where budget details are being hammered out. 
    Futures were trading down 0.2-0.6 percent, putting the STOXX on track to fall back to the
lower-end of the past two weeks' trading range.
    From the corporate world there is no major news so far although there is some IPO activity
(Neoen, LeasePlan and Eurotorg) that could catch investors' attention following the
disappointing market debut of Aston Martin. 
    Also on the watchlist are shares in European banks after their peers in Asia and the US rose
on the back of rising U.S. Treasury yields. 
    In results, UK retailers are in focus as Ted Baker posted a 3.5 percent rise in half-year
revenue, while DFS Furniture reported a 48.5 percent fall in full-year pretax profit, hurt by a
summer heat wave. On trader has called Ted Baker to open down 1 percent and DFS down 2 percent.

relief after the Italian government signalled it would lower its budget deficit from 2020. 
    The mixed open would come as the dollar hit an 11-month high on the yen after strong U.S.
economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011. [nL4N1WK09E]

prepared a letter to open an infraction procedure against the
Italian government for its plans to increase deficit spending
next year, la Repubblica newspaper said in an unsourced report
on Thursday.
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has already received an
informal note saying as much, the daily added. Deputy Prime
Minister Matteo Salvini on Wednesday denied the government had
received anything from the commission.
    Officially, the budget targets that form the basis of next
year's budget must be sent to Brussels by Oct. 15, and the
commission must deliver its reaction by the end of the month.

    BUDAPEST, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hungary has submitted invoices
worth about 350 billion forints  (1.08 billion euros) to the
European Union for projects financed from EU funds, Finance
Minister Mihaly Varga said on Thursday, adding there was no
reason for Brussels to withhold the funds.
    Hungary has mostly pre-financed EU-funded projects this
year, boosting the budget deficit above the full-year target by
the end of August.
    A European Commission source said last month that a dispute
between Hungary and Brussels over alleged irregularities on some
EU-funded projects may not be settled this year which could
delay payments from the EU.
    Local media has reported that funds worth up to 500 billion
forints may be at risk. [nL8N1W54RN][nL8N1W54RN]
    Hungary, one of the top recipients of EU cash, received
about 150 billion forints worth of fresh funds last week and
could receive further payments by the end of the year, Varga
told reporters on the sidelines of a business conference.
    ""The EU will transfer a substantial amount, not all of the
money. We are working on this, there is no reason for the EU to
withhold the funds,"" Varga said in response to a question. He
declined to estimate the amount of money Hungary could receive.
    ""We have told them to transfer the full amount. There are
invoices worth about 350 billion forints pending which we think
could be refunded already. They are now being examined as part
of a regular screening procedure,"" Varga said.
    The 350 billion forints represents just a small part of
spending related to EU projects so far this year.
    According Finance Ministry data, in the first eight months
the cash-flow deficit widened to 1.646 trillion forints,
exceeding the full-year target of 1.361 trillion in the 2018
budget.
    By the end of August budget spending related to EU projects
totalled 1.388 trillion forints, while reimbursements were only
183 billion forints, the Finance Ministry said last month.

    * FTSE 100 down 0.8 pct
    * British American Tobacco falls 3.8 pct 
    * Aston Martin extend post- IPO losses 

    By Tom Wilson
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The UK's top share index fell on
Thursday morning, dragged down  by the defensive consumer goods
sector as strong U.S. economic data lifted Treasury yields to
their highest since mid-2011, putting pressure on global
markets.
    The FTSE 100 <.FTSE> fell 0.8 percent to 7,450.15 points by
0839 GMT, on course for its biggest daily loss in a month and
mirroring overnight weakness in Asia and across major European
indexes as markets digested prospects of a U.S. interest rate
hike.
    ""Markets across Europe and Asia tripped up on Thursday after
a rise in U.S. Treasury yields to levels not seen since
2011"", Russ Mould an investment director at AJ Bell wrote to his
clients. 
    ""The Treasury yield is commonly seen as the risk-free rate
for investing, so an increase tends to be negative for other
asset classes including shares"", he added.  
    Weighing heaviest was the defensive consumer staples sector.
 British American Tobacco <BATS.L>, which was trading without
entitlement to its latest dividend pay-out, was the biggest
faller of the day, shedding 3.9 percent. 
    All major sectors apart from financials, as banks typically
benefit from rising rates and bond yields, were in the red. 
    Healthcare and consumer discretionary were the second- and
third-biggest fallers respectively.
    The domestically focused mid cap index <.FTMC> also fell,
shedding 0.5 percent.
    There, shares of Ted Baker <TED.L> fell 10.4 percent after
the British clothing retailer warned of a ""challenging""
remainder of the year as it posted a 3.2 percent drop in pretax
profit for the first half. [nL4N1WK1I5]
    Among other retailers, DFS Furniture <DFSD.L> shares fell as
much as 10 percent, before recovering most of its losses, after
it said full-year pretax profit fell by nearly half after
Britain's summer heatwave.    
    Luxury carmaker Aston Martin <AML.L> was down 0.9 percent,
extending losses from its stock market debut on Wednesday. It
had priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation
of $5.6 billion. 
    British new car sales fell by roughly 20 percent in
September, preliminary data showed, as carmakers struggled to
adjust to stricter emissions standards. [nL8N1WJ58H] 
    Separately, Japanese carmaker Nissan <7201.T> said there
would be ""serious implications"" for Britain's manufacturing
industry if the United Kingdom fails to secure a trade deal with
the European Union. [nL8N1WK1K0]

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The British pound rose on
Thursday, bouncing off four-week lows, after a media report that
Ireland is backing Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for an
all-UK customs union with the European Union.
    Backing from Dublin could help Britain towards overcoming
one of the thorniest issues in the Brexit negotiations, a
""backstop"" deal on the border between Northern Ireland, part of
the United Kingdom, and EU-member state Ireland.
    Ahead of an EU summit this month, Ireland is prepared to
back one of May's proposals if no other solution to the Irish
border issue is found - the whole of the UK to operate within a
customs union with the EU, the Financial Times reported.
[nFWN1WK03F]
    ""The pound has not weakened as feared during the week of the
Conservative Party conference. In fact, it has been overshadowed
by a report from the FT which suggests that Ireland is backing
PM May’s emerging plan for an all-UK customs union with the EU,""
MUFG analysts said in a note. 
    ""The EU would have to provide some encouragement as well
that it is warming to the idea for the pound to stage a rally in
the coming weeks.""
    May's conference speech on Wednesday, in which she stuck to
her script on Brexit and expressed confidence Britain would get
a deal to avoid a sudden and disorderly exit from the EU next
March, lacked anything new to shift market sentiment and the
pound was little moved. [nL8N1WJ1NV]
    After hitting as low as $1.2922 <GBP=D3> overnight - its
weakest since Sept. 10 - on the back of a surging dollar,
sterling recovered to $1.2967, up 0.2 percent on the day.
    Britain's currency also gained versus the euro, and was up
0.2 percent at 88.61 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    In her speech, May appealed to her party to unite behind her
plan to leave the EU, warning critics their arguments could put
Brexit in jeopardy. 
    May's officials are planning to rush her Brexit deal through
Parliament to stave off a rebellion from her own party,
Bloomberg reported on Thursday. [nFWN1WK031]
    ""Somehow everything seems to be rather deadlocked at the
moment, and as a result the downside risks for sterling remain
in place,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A decade since Lehman Brothers
bank collapsed, the world's top lenders largely meet tougher
capital requirements aimed at averting a repeat of the ensuing
markets meltdown, regulators said on Thursday.
    The Basel Committee of regulators said that as of December
2017, the world's 111 biggest cross-border or ""Group 1"" banks
would have had a collective capital shortfall of just 25.8
billion euros ($29.8 billion), had all Basel's rules been in
force, a fraction of their earnings.
    The overall core equity capital ratio, which measures
capital to risk-weighted assets, would have risen to 12.9
percent from 12.5 percent in June 2017, roughly triple
pre-crisis levels.
    Basel has published regular updates on compliance with its
tougher capital rules introduced in the aftermath of the crisis,
but the latest assumes that a final batch of requirements agreed
only last December are also in force.
    The minimum versions of these additional rules won't become 
mandatory until January 2022, but Thursday's figures show banks
are largely compliant years ahead of the deadline as markets
pile pressure on lenders to demonstrate their financial
resilience.
    Banks had lobbied hard to water down the additions, warning
that hefty increases in capital requirements would make it
harder for them to lend to businesses.
    But Basel said on Thursday there was no significant increase
in minimum capital requirements due to the final rules added
last December. The capital shortfall does not reflect any
additional capital requirements that national regulators impose.
    
    
    
    OP RISK ROCKETS
    Most of a bank's core capital buffer covers the risk of
loans defaulting, but such ""credit"" risk has fallen
significantly and now represents 65.2 percent of buffers, Basel
said.
    The amount of capital set aside to cover operational risks
such as fines for misconduct, fraud, cyber attacks, poor
internal controls and unauthorised trading, has risen sharply.
It has increased from 7.8 percent at the end of June 2011 to
16.4 percent currently, Basel said.
    Since the financial crisis, banks have been fined billions
of dollars for trying to rig interest rate benchmarks such as
Libor, and currency markets.
    Apart from capital, major banks must also issue a special 
debt known as TLAC that can be converted to capital if a crisis
burns through their core capital buffer. This aims to avoid a
repeat of taxpayers having to bail out lenders.
    When the minimum requirements for TLAC due in 2022 are
applied, eight of the world's 30 top banks have a combined
shortfall of 82 billion euros, down from 109 billion at the end
of June 2017, Basel said.
    ($1 = 0.8666 euros)

    By Natalia Zinets
    KIEV, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine has given a Hungarian consul
72 hours to leave country after accusing his consulate of
illegally issuing passports to ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine, the
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. 
    Ukraine accused the consul, who is based in the western town
of Berehove near the Hungarian border, of ""activities
incompatible with the status of a consular officer"". 
    The expulsion is the latest in a series of diplomatic rows
between Ukraine and Hungary, which have led to Hungary promising
to block Kiev's aspirations to join the European Union and NATO.
 
    ""We hope that the Hungarian side will refrain from any
unfriendly steps towards Ukraine in the future, and that its
officials will not violate Ukrainian legislation,"" the foreign
ministry said in a statement. 
    Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin had warned in a
Facebook post on Wednesday that ""the events around the
distribution of Hungarian citizenship in Berehove, let's say, do
not add joy. They only complicate the already not perfect
relationship between the two countries.""
    Ukraine's move to oblige teachers to use only Ukrainian in
secondary schools prompted Hungary's Foreign Minister last year
to say bilateral relations were at their lowest point since the
fall of the Soviet Union.  
    Ukraine has sought greater integration with Europe since the
ouster of a Moscow-backed president by mass protests in 2014 and
the subsequent outbreak of a pro-Russian separatist insurgency
in eastern regions.

    MILAN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday as
defensive stocks came under pressure after strong U.S. data
lifted global yields and bolstered expectations for rate hikes
in the world's biggest economy.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark index was down
0.6 percent by 0844 GMT, while Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> declined
0.4 percent and the UK's FTSE <.FTSE> fell 0.8 percent.   
    Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. services sector activity
raced to a 21-year high in September, lifting Treasury yields to
their highest since mid 2011. That in turn also boosted euro
zone government bond yields on Thursday. [nL8N1WK16B] 
    ""The Treasury yield is commonly seen as the risk-free rate
for investing, so an increase tends to be negative for other
asset classes including shares,"" said Russ Mould, investment
director at AJ Bell.    
    Defensive companies including consumer and healthcare stocks
were the main drag on the STOXX 600. Rising yields make their
steady dividend streams less appealing. 
    Brighter economic prospects also weighed on the sector,
which had been in demand this summer on worries that trade wars
could slow global growth.
    Shares in big multinationals British American Tobacco
<BATS.L>, Nestle <NESN.S> and Novartis <NOVN.S> were down
between 0.5 and 3.8 percent. 
    Utilities <.SX6P>, which tend to be penalised by rising
yields also because of their high level of debt, fell 1.5
percent. 
    In contrast, financials tend to benefit from rising rates
and bond yields, which help banks earn fatter margins on their
traditional lending business. 
    German lenders Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> and Deutsche Bank
<DBKGn.DE> rose 1.9 and 1.5 percent respectively, as German
10-year bond yields hit a 4-1/2 month high. 
    Italian banks were choppy as investors monitored
developments in Rome, where the government is trying to finalise
budget details after clashing with the EU over its deficit
targets. 
    After opening lower, the Italian banking index <.FTIT8300>
turned higher and rose 0.9 percent.
    Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> fell 3.6 percent after news it was
being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over a 200
billion euro money laundering scandal involving its Estonian
branch. [nL8N1WK1EB]
    ""They are a perfect example of how regulators come down hard
on banks who appear to have broken the rules,"" said Markus
Huber, trader at City of London Markets.
    Among top movers on the STOXX was Danish maker of diagnostic
devices Ambu <AMBUb.CO>, which fell 6.6 percent after a strategy
update, while British pharmaceutical firm BTG <BTG.L> rose 6.4
percent after it upgraded its sales forecast.

    By Noor Zainab Hussain and Tanishaa Nadkar
    Oct 4 (Reuters) - DFS Furniture <DFSD.L> warned on Thursday
of a challenging consumer market before Britain leaves the
European Union after reporting a significant drop in annual
profit, hurt by a heatwave that kept people out of stores.
    ""Overall we expect the market to remain subdued into 2019,
constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment,""
Chief Executive Officer Ian Filby said in a statement.
    Recent surveys showed British consumers were worried about 
Brexit. Sofas are seen as a discretionary ""big ticket"" purchase
and the fall in the value of the pound and a squeeze on wages
has led Britons to cut back on non-essential items. [nL8N1WD30C]
    ""The group continues to face a particularly uncertain UK
consumer market in the run up to Brexit in March next year,""
said DFS, which earns 97 percent of its money from the UK.
    DFS said it was working to offset the likely impact from
Brexit, including volatility in demand and delays at borders,
with just over half of finished products sold by DFS being
imported into the UK from mainland Europe or China.
    ""We are trialling ways to accelerate the movement of goods
internationally to mitigate some of these impacts,"" said DFS,
which has more than 100 stores across the UK and Ireland.
    The upholstery retailer, founded in 1969, reported a 48.5
percent fall in pretax profit to 25.8 million pounds ($33.4
million) in the year to July 28. It had warned in July that
profit would decline. [nL4N1U82OM]  
    Shares in DFS fell 10 percent in early trade but clawed back
some of their losses to trade down 1.9 percent at 206 pence at
0905 GMT in a very volatile session.
    
    FEELING THE HEAT
    Filby told Reuters that the hottest summer in decades
stopped Britons from making their usual trip to retail parks on
the edge of town on weekends to buy furniture. 
    ""When you have the sort of record conditions that were last
seen back in 1976, Britons go to the sea, they go to parks, they
have barbecues and therefore we had a very suppressed last three
months of the year,"" he said.
    DFS, which entered continental Europe with its first store
in the Netherlands in 2014, said the market had recovered, with
growth in like-for-like orders for the first nine weeks of its
latest financial year.
    Filby cautioned that this was part of a ""bounce back"", which
would last another month or so, before returning to a subdued
trading level.
     DFS however, expects growth in its bottom line after
factoring in the downturn. [nL4N1U83RO]

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A decade since Lehman Brothers
bank collapsed, the world's top lenders largely meet tougher
capital requirements aimed at averting a repeat of the ensuing
markets meltdown, regulators said on Thursday.
    The Basel Committee of regulators said that, as of December
2017, the world's 111 biggest cross-border, or ""Group 1"", banks
would have had a collective capital shortfall of only 25.8
billion euros ($29.8 billion) had all Basel's rules been in
force, a fraction of their earnings.
    The overall core equity capital ratio, which measures
capital to risk-weighted assets, would have risen to 12.9
percent from 12.5 percent in June 2017, roughly triple
pre-crisis levels.
    Basel has published regular updates on compliance with the
tougher capital rules introduced in the aftermath of the crisis,
but the latest assumes that a final batch of requirements agreed
only last December are also in force.
    The minimum versions of these additional rules won't become 
mandatory until January 2022, but Thursday's figures show banks
are largely compliant years ahead of the deadline as markets
pile pressure on lenders to demonstrate their financial
resilience.
    Banks had lobbied hard to water down the additions, warning
that hefty increases in capital requirements would make it
harder for them to lend to businesses.
    But Basel said on Thursday there was no significant increase
in minimum capital requirements as a result of the final rules
added last December. The capital shortfall does not reflect any
additional capital requirements that national regulators impose.
    Separately, the European Banking Authority said that banks
in the European Union would need a collective 24.5 billion euros
of capital to meet the full Basel requirements, of which 6
billion euros would be for core buffers.
    
    
    
    OPERATIONAL RISK ROCKETS
    Most of a bank's core capital buffer covers the risk of
loans defaulting, but such ""credit"" risk has fallen
significantly and now represents 65.2 percent of buffers, Basel
said.
    The amount of capital set aside to cover operational risks
-- such as fines for misconduct, fraud, cyber attacks, poor
internal controls and unauthorised trading -- has risen sharply.
It has increased from 7.8 percent at the end of June 2011 to
16.4 percent currently, Basel said.
    Since the financial crisis, banks have been fined billions
of dollars for trying to rig interest rate benchmarks such as
Libor and currency markets.
    Apart from capital, major banks must also issue a special 
debt known as TLAC that can be converted to capital if a crisis
burns through their core capital buffer. This aims to avoid a
repeat of taxpayers having to bail out lenders.
    When the minimum requirements for TLAC due in 2022 are
applied, eight of the world's 30 top banks have a combined
shortfall of 82 billion euros, down from 109 billion at the end
of June 2017, Basel said.

    WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hanging on a wall in John
Bolton's West Wing office is a memento of his proudest
achievement as national security adviser: a framed copy of
President Donald Trump's order to pull the United States out of
the Iran nuclear deal.
    Right next to it hangs a cartoon mocking the agreement. 
    Bolton's choice of decor reflects his disdain for the
deal secured by President Barack Obama and other world powers in
2015, and his relentless focus on trying to isolate Tehran and
cripple its economy by reimposing tight sanctions.
    Bolton took over as national security adviser in early
April. A month later, Trump abandoned the Iran deal, meeting a
promise he had made as a presidential candidate, which other
wary West Wing advisers had persuaded him to put off. 
    Bolton changed that dynamic quickly. In an interview with
Reuters, he said he reassured Trump that his instincts were
right and that he could ignore the pleas and warnings of
moderates and European allies to stay in the deal. 
    ""It's not the end of the world,"" Bolton said he told Trump
in arguing for withdrawal from the pact. ""The Western alliance
is not going to fall apart."" 
    Proud of his role in the policy shift, Bolton said he
believes the reimposition of sanctions is already heaping
pressure on Iran's leaders. 
    ""I think the return of the sanctions has had a devastating
effect on their economy and I think it's going to get worse.""
    Iran’s economy and currency have already been hit as big
European companies exit to avoid being hurt by U.S. sanctions.
The pressure will increase in November when sanctions targeting
the oil industry, the lifeblood of Iran’s economy, are to take
effect.
    In Washington's community of foreign policy veterans, Bolton
has been a super-hawk for decades, whether as a tough-talking
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W.
Bush or as a prominent analyst on Fox News.
    Critics call him an ideologue and a warmonger who retaliates
 against dissenting views, while allies say he is an
intellectual and a shrewd operator committed to ensuring the
supremacy of U.S. power. 
    Over the years, Bolton has advocated for regime change in
both Iran and North Korea, opposed direct negotiations with both
and said the United States should stage pre-emptive attacks
against their nuclear facilities. 
    He was also a firm supporter of the Iraq war and has been a
longtime advocate of tough policies toward Russia. 
    Now, in the most influential position of his long career,
the 69-year-old Bolton has softened some of those bellicose
positions, at least in public, and says he is happy to follow 
the president's lead.
    That has kept him in good graces with Trump, who has made
improved ties with both North Korea and Russia a centerpiece of
his foreign policy, and who does not like being overshadowed by
his staff.
    And it allows Bolton the room to shape and execute a
hardline strategy on Iran. 
    ""Bolton is obsessed with Iran, and everything else plays
second fiddle,"" said one senior official from France, whose
president, Emmanuel Macron, pleaded unsuccessfully with Trump to
remain in the Iran deal during an April visit to the White
House. 
    
    WORKING WITH TRUMP
    The two men have different views on Russia. While Trump has 
spoken admiringly of Vladimir Putin, Bolton never does that, and
accused the Russian president of lying about Moscow's
involvement in the 2016 presidential election.
    He opposes easing a wide range of U.S. sanctions on Russia
and tweeted in March that the United States should have a
strategic response to a new array of Russian nuclear weapons ""to
show our allies in Europe that we will not let Russia push the
U.S. or its allies around.""   
    He has no qualms about opposing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis
and other senior officials who want to extend the New START
nuclear arms control deal with Russia.
    But officials across the national security apparatus, from
the State and Defense departments to intelligence agencies, say
Bolton has studiously avoided directly challenging Trump's
declared goal of improving ties with Putin.
    Bolton went to Moscow to help organize Trump's summit with
Putin in Helsinki in July.
    ""His accident avoidance is obvious when it comes to Russia,""
said one U.S. official on condition of anonymity. ""If it were up
to him, he would take a much harder position on sanctions and
election meddling.""
    In a recent interview with Reuters, Trump himself said
Bolton has dialed back some of his harder-line positions since
coming into the White House.
    ""He’s a terrific person who is really working hard,"" Trump
said. ""Now, are his views the same as they have been for 20
years that I’ve been watching him on television, where he wants
to go to war with everybody, and if possible, let’s do five
nations at a time? No, his views aren’t that any more."" 
    Bolton has cemented his relationship with Trump by keeping
it simple when he briefs the president.
    The dry, professorial style of Bolton's predecessor, H.R.
McMaster, frequently left Trump impatient and fuming, multiple
officials have said. Bolton uses a more streamlined approach,
gleaned from his time in law school.
    ""I do outlines - bigger ones, then reduce them down to
smaller ones, then distill notes down to their bare essence so
they’ll fit on a notecard,"" Bolton told Reuters.
    A senior White House official said Trump sees Bolton as an
essential voice in his inner circle but is not always swayed by
him. ""He's very good at making his case and the president always
listens to him, but won't necessarily do what he says,"" the
official said. 
            
    IRAN FOCUS
    Bolton has had most success with Trump on Iran. He has
played a central role in promoting the Trump administration's
efforts to create a security and political alliance with six
Gulf Arab states, Egypt and Jordan, in large part to help
counter Iran's expansion in the region.
    In a speech in New York last week, Bolton warned Iran: ""If
you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed
be hell to pay.""
    That hard edge was a hallmark of his time in the Bush
administration, critics say. 
    Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as chief of staff to former
Secretary of State Colin Powell when Bolton was undersecretary
for arms control and non-proliferation, often confronted Bolton
over personnel and policy issues at the State Department.
    Wilkerson recalled a 2002 meeting in which Bolton asserted
that North Korea was “a paper tiger.” Wilkerson warned that in
the event of a war Pyongyang could unleash massive artillery
barrages that would claim tens of thousands of South Korean and
American lives.
    ""John looks at me coldly and says, 'I don't do war. That's
your bailiwick.' I replied, 'Oh, you just start them,' …. It’s
his Number One solution to any problem he sees in the world,""
said Wilkerson, who emerged as a vocal critic of the Iraq war
that Bolton had advocated for.
    A senior administration official close to Bolton dismissed
Wilkerson's concerns, saying Bolton shows ""a deft ability to
coordinate diplomatic, economic, and military policy to advance
and defend America’s national security interests.""
    One Defense Department official said Bolton blocks out
opinions that run counter to his own in discussions with other
government agencies. 
    ""Dissenting views don't have a way to be heard, and it's
clear that they aren't welcome in any event, especially about
Iran,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The result is that people who have years or even decades of
experience, especially in the field, are either ignored or
intimidated."" 
    Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers,
disputed that view of Bolton. ""He plays team ball well."" 
    Bolton did not respond to the allegation but told Reuters he
relishes verbal jousting with colleagues.
    ""I’m a litigator by training. My life is debate. So if
someone has a different view, I can’t wait,"" he said with a
smile.

    WHY EUROPE'S NO LONGER A BUND YIELD PLAY (1000 GMT)
    Surging yields is the buzz word on markets today and Credit Suisse strategists led by Andrew
Garthwaite are out with a timely view on the how the long-standing correlation between European
stocks and Bund yields has broken down.
    Continental Europe used to be a play on Bund yields, they say, recalling that when yields on
German government rose, Europe outperformed in dollar terms 80 percent of the time.
    But why is this no longer the case and what does it mean for investors?
    ""Underlying this has been a weakening in the relationship between financials and Bund yields
as banks are facing a range of issues including Italy, GEM exposure and disruption,"" they say. 
    On top of that, European banks now just weigh 10 percent total market capitalisation and
that has pushed the correlation between banks and European equities to fall sharply to 0.2 from

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SHARES DOWN AS MARKETS MULL FED RATE HIKE PROSPECTS (0719 GMT)
    European shares started the day in the red, with all major benchmarks down between 0.2-0.5
percent as markets digested remarks by Jerome Powell, the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman, that it
may raise interest rates amid strength in the world's biggest economy. [nN9N1LO00F]
    European banks <.SX7P> bucked the trend, climbing 0.2 percent as they followed gains for
their Asian and U.S. counterparts. Europe's personal and household goods and food and beverage
sectors were the biggest fallers in early trade, down 2 and 1.2 percent respectively.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: BANKS, IPO ACTIVITY, UK RETAILERS (0643 GMT)
    European shares are set to open lower today as markets reprice expectations for a rate hike
in the U.S and monitor development in Rome where budget details are being hammered out. 
    Futures were trading down 0.2-0.6 percent, putting the STOXX on track to fall back to the
lower-end of the past two weeks' trading range.
    From the corporate world there is no major news so far although there is some IPO activity
(Neoen, LeasePlan and Eurotorg) that could catch investors' attention following the
disappointing market debut of Aston Martin. 
    Also on the watchlist are shares in European banks after their peers in Asia and the US rose
on the back of rising U.S. Treasury yields. 
    In results, UK retailers are in focus as Ted Baker posted a 3.5 percent rise in half-year
revenue, while DFS Furniture reported a 48.5 percent fall in full-year pretax profit, hurt by a
summer heat wave. On trader has called Ted Baker to open down 1 percent and DFS down 2 percent.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The European Union's top court
should back the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme
against a group of German complainants seeking to block it on
legal grounds, the court's adviser on the case said on Thursday.
    The programme is set to end at the end of the year in any
case, but the court's ruling will set a key precedent for future
ECB policy decisions.
    Advocate general Melchior Wathelet rejected complainant
arguments that the ECB's 2 trillion-euro ($2.30 trillion)
purchases of government bonds had bankrolled indebted
governments and distorted financial markets.
    The purchases, a cornerstone of the ECB's efforts that have
revived inflation and growth in the euro zone, has often been
criticised in Germany for inflating bond prices and endangering
taxpayer money.
    ""The programme does not infringe the prohibition of monetary
financing and does not exceed the powers of the ECB,"" Wathelet
said in his opinion to the court.
    The advocate's opinions are not binding, but the court
generally follows them.  
    Wathelet emphasised, among other factors, that the risks
associated with the purchases were only partly shared across
countries and that the ECB retained the power to stop them at
any time, meaning they did not represent a guaranteed source of
funding for governments.    
    The European Court of Justice had been asked by Germany's
constitutional court to provide a preliminary ruling on whether
the ECB's bond purchases broke EU law.
    Once that ruling is out, the case will go back to the German
court in Karlsruhe, where the group of conservative German
academics and politicians brought the original case.

    EDINBURGH, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The European Court of Justice
(ECJ) has been asked for a preliminary ruling on whether Britain
alone can reverse its decision to leave the European Union,
according to a statement by Scotland's Court of Session on
Thursday.
    The ECJ hopes to make a decision on the case before
Christmas, a source close to the case told Reuters.
    Scottish lawmakers opposed to Brexit filed a petition to the
Court of Session, Scotland's highest court, in August in an
attempt to show that Britain has a unilateral option of staying
in the world's biggest trading bloc, once the outcome of Brexit
is known.
    They argue that while there is no legal doubt that Britain
could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 EU member
states, it should seek to establish a legal right to do so
unilaterally, whether the rest of the bloc likes it or not.
    The lawmakers behind the challenge represent electoral areas
in Scotland which voted strongly to remain in the EU in the June
2016 referendum. The United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave.
    The Court of Session upheld their request and, less than two
weeks later, has asked the Luxembourg-based ECJ, which rules on
the meaning of EU law, for a preliminary ruling. 
    The Scottish petitioners argue that legal certainty about
the process is needed in advance of any British parliamentary
vote on an EU withdrawal deal because no country has ever before
 withdrawn from the European Union.

    By Natalia Zinets and Marton Dunai
    KIEV/BUDAPEST, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine and Hungary
announced tit-for-tat expulsions of each other's diplomats on
Thursday, the latest in a series of spats between the neighbours
that threatens to set back Kiev's aspirations for European Union
and NATO membership. 
    Ukraine said it had given a Hungarian consul 72 hours to
leave the country after accusing his consulate of illegally
issuing passports to members of an ethnic Hungarian minority in
Ukraine. Ukraine's constitution bars Ukrainians from holding
citizenship of other countries.
    Kiev accused the consul, who is based in the western town of
Berehove near the Hungarian border, of ""activities incompatible
with the status of a consular officer"".
    Hungary in turn expelled a Ukrainian consul in Budapest and
reiterated a threat to block Ukraine's EU and NATO integration.
    Ukraine has sought greater integration with Europe since the
ouster of a Moscow-backed president by mass protests in 2014 and
the subsequent outbreak of a pro-Russian separatist insurgency
in eastern regions that has killed more than 10,000 people.
    ""We hope that the Hungarian side will refrain from any
unfriendly steps towards Ukraine in the future, and that its
officials will not violate Ukrainian legislation,"" Ukraine's
foreign ministry said in a statement.
    Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine
of pursuing ""an extreme campaign which incites hatred against
Transcarpathian Hungarians"" and denied that its consul had
broken the law.   
    He also criticised Ukraine's decision to conduct military
exercises near the Hungarian border. The head of Ukraine's armed
forces, in a Reuters interview on Saturday, denied the exercises
were hostile to Hungary. [nL8N1WG0NI] 
    ""If a country aspiring for NATO membership settles military
forces to the border of NATO, it cannot join NATO, and if it
launches an attack against dual citizenship, an established EU
institution, it cannot join the EU either,"" Szijjarto said.
    ""As long as Ukraine does not meet its obligations undertaken
to NATO and the EU, we will veto every attempt aimed to bring
Ukraine closer to these two integrations.""
    Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin had warned in a
Facebook post on Wednesday that ""the events around the
distribution of Hungarian citizenship in Berehove, let's say, do
not add joy.""
    Szijjarto also repeated criticism of Ukraine's move to
oblige teachers to use only Ukrainian in secondary schools,
which he previously said had driven bilateral relations to their
lowest point since the fall of the Soviet Union.
    Szijjarto met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov for
talks in Moscow on Wednesday. Asked on Thursday whether blocking
Ukraine's aspirations for western integration was playing into
Russia's hands, he said:
    ""I would like to stress once more that I don't care what
Russians think about the politics that we pursue regarding
Ukraine."" 
    ""What I care about is 150,000 Hungarian people who must be
defended because their daily lives, their minority rights are
visibly in danger,"" he added.

215,1245,9a9ae705093634f417bca5bbfd9355ea,Complete insanity' of Italy debt plans may lead to huge restructuring -euro officials,2018-10-04 20:22:52,EUR,-2.49211,2018-10-04 20:24:30,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    By Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Senior European Union officials
believe Italy risks facing a massive debt restructuring task -
and one that would hit its own citizens hardest - unless it
backs down in its unprecedented challenge to Brussels' budget
rules.
    Italy's 2.3 trillion euro national debt dwarfs that of
Greece and the euro zone bailout fund would not be able to cope
with the costs of supporting its government in a crisis. Any
such crisis could threaten the euro itself, seen by many as the
EU's greatest achievement.
    Since Brexit, EU officials also say they have seen that
leniency gets them nowhere in dealing with governments that want
to challenge their authority.
    The populist government in Rome said last week it wanted to
triple the 2019 budget deficit plan its predecessors set out to
2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and keep it at that
level also in 2020 and 2021. 
    On Monday, Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria presented
that plan to euro zone finance ministers, called the Eurogroup.
    ""When Tria talked about planning a deficit of 2.4 percent
for the next three years in the Eurogroup, jaws dropped
everywhere,"" one senior euro zone official said. ""The mood was
that this was really a terrible signal.""
    The increased borrowing would help pay for the campaign
promises made by Italy's ruling parties - the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement and right-wing League - to lower the retirement
age, cut taxes, invest in infrastructure and boost welfare.
    The draft budget blatantly breaks EU budget rules that
oblige Italy, which has a debt to GDP ratio of 133 percent, the
second-highest in Europe after Greece, to cut debt every year
and turn its structural deficit into a surplus.
    With Italian economic growth at a crawl, such plans have
also raised investor concerns over Rome's ability to repay, and
Italian government bond yields have surged to 4.5-year highs
this week as investors sell up.
    The yield rise and criticism from euro zone finance prompted
Rome to suggest it could cut the deficit in 2020 to 2.2 percent
and bring it down to 2 percent in 2021. But that was not nearly
enough, officials said, even though yields fell in response.
    ""The positive market reaction to the Italian proposal on
2020 and 2021 is absolutely ridiculous, they are desperate to
find some good news, but that means they are under an illusion,""
a second senior official said.
    ""People are underestimating the scale, the complete insanity
of the deviation. And Italian growth assumptions are ludicrous.
Growth, especially with this government, will not get better, it
will get worse,"" the second official said.
    
    SLEEPWALKING INTO A CRISIS
    ""The budget plans for the next three years mean that Italy,
and the euro zone with it, are sleepwalking into a next crisis,""
a third senior official said.
    The euro zone's European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout
fund, set up to lend to sovereigns cut off from markets in
exchange for reforms, helped Greece get back on its feet after
three successive bailouts worth almost 250 billion euros in
total.
    But with Italy's refinancing needs at 277 billion euros in
2019, 197 billion euros in 2020 and 181 billion in 2021
according to Reuters data, the first year alone would be too
much to handle by the ESM alone. The political will is also
missing. 
    ""The general agreement is that Italy is too big to save
through the ESM. And it is not just technical issues about the
ESM's capacity, but first and foremost political: people,
especially the northerners but others too, don't want to even
try using the ESM for Italy,"" a fourth senior official said.
    ""So a big, huge, debt restructuring would be the only way,""
the official said, in a view echoed by several others.
    Some two-thirds of Italy's national debt is owned by Italian
institutions and individuals, making them potentially the
biggest victims of a debt crisis.
    ""If things go bad, a restructuring will have to follow, and
that will wipe out the savings of a large part of the Italian
people,"" the first senior official said.
    ""I am not sure this is what they voted for, but they voted
for a government that could make this happen,"" he said. 
    Euro zone officials said the leaders of Italy's ruling
coalition, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, are not interested
in sticking to EU budget rules because conflict with Brussels
helps their popularity in opinion polls.
    The question now is whether pressure from the euro zone,
including the likely rejection of the draft budget by the
European Commission this month as well as from Italian
businesses which stand to lose the most in a crisis, would be
effective quickly enough for the budget to be changed.
    ""The kind of confrontation they would get is way beyond what
they could imagine,"" the second official said referring to the
potential market turmoil.
    ""They are living on the moon. It is completely irresponsible
what is happening.""

218,1256,260834cc0a844729a37d7a217c965862,FACTBOX-The main rating agencies' stance on Italy,2018-10-04 20:51:29,EUR,0.02431,2018-10-04 20:51:37,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    MILAN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A decision on Italy's debt by
Standard & Poor's and Moody's is approaching fast with both
agencies due to review the country's ratings this month.
    Following is a summary of the main rating agencies' stance
on Italy.
        
              Moody's       S&P        Fitch        DBRS
   Rating       Baa2        BBB         BBB      BBB (high)

              negative                           
  
    1. MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE
    Moody's will decide by the end of October whether to cut
Italy's debt ratings after extending the review period to have
more details on the government's budget plans.
    It had placed Italy's ""Baa2"" rating on review for a possible
downgrade in May, citing pledges in a government pact signed by
the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League
to increase spending, cut taxes and scrap a key 2011 pension
reform.
    A downgrade to ""Baa3"" would take Italy to just one notch
above junk status.
    Moody's had changed its outlook on Italy to ""negative"" in
December 2016 after voters rejected a key constitutional reform,
prompting then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to resign.
    At the onset of the euro zone crisis in 2011, Moody's rated
Italy's debt ""Aa2"", which had remained unchanged since 2002 and
stood six notches above the current rating.
    
    2. S&P GLOBAL RATINGS
    S&P is scheduled to review its ratings on Italy on Oct. 26.
    The agency rates Italy's debt ""BBB"" with a stable outlook,
following an upgrade from ""BBB-"" in October last year. 
    The unexpected move was S&P's first upgrade of Italy since
it started rating the country in 1988. The agency cited a
strengthening economy, diminishing risks to banks and
expectations of improving public finances.
    S&P affirmed Italy at ""BBB"" on April 27, warning that the
rating would come under pressure if a new government strayed
from the path of budgetary improvement or unwound past reforms.
       
    3. FITCH RATINGS 
    Fitch on Aug. 31 cut its outlook on Italy's ""BBB"" rating to
""negative"" saying it expected a degree of fiscal loosening from
the new coalition government that would leave the country's high
debt more exposed to potential shocks.
    The agency cited ""the new and untested nature of the
government, the sizeable policy differences between its
coalition partners, and inconsistencies between the high cost of
... (electoral promises) .... and its stated objective to reduce
public debt.""
    
    4. DBRS
    Italy lost its last remaining ""A"" mark when DBRS downgraded
the country to ""BBB (high)"" from ""A (low)"" in January 2017.
    On Sept. 25 DBRS's co-head of sovereign ratings Nichola
James told Reuters Italy's investment-grade credit rating could
absorb a further rise in the country's debt. [nL8N1WA4GB]
    The agency had last affirmed Italy's rating with a stable
trend in July, saying a strengthening economy and banks'
improving health offset significant political risks.
    DBRS expects Italy to run a higher budget deficit under the
new government, but without putting at significant risk an
expected decline in public debt as a share of gross domestic
product.
    DBRS plans to reassess the situation in the autumn after the
2019 budget.

    By George Georgiopoulos
    ATHENS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Greece has been working on an
asset protection scheme to help its banks offload sour loans
from their balance sheets and shown it to European Union
competition authorities and banking supervisors, bankers close
to the matter said on Thursday.
    The scheme would involve setting up special purpose vehicles
(SPVs) where billions of euros of bad loans would be transferred
from bank balance sheets to help speed up the clean-up process.
    ""There is such a plan that has been prepared by the HFSF
bank rescue fund some time ago,"" one senior banker told Reuters
on Thursday, declining to be named.
    ""The plan has been shown to the government, European
authorities and SSM banking supervision,"" the banker said.
    The key question remains whether such a plan could get the
green light from the EU's DG Competition or hit a brick wall as
a form of state aid.
    The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), the bank
rescue fund that owns stakes in Greek banks after taking part in
three recapitalisations, would not confirm whether such a scheme
was ready to go into operation if it gets EU clearance.
    ""All this talk about an asset protection scheme is ideas,
thoughts that the fund exchanges with stakeholders. There is no
final, concrete plan,"" an HFSF official told Reuters.
    A senior government official said that Athens was ""not
looking into such solutions soon"", adding that bank fundamentals
did not justify Wednesday's selloff which saw bank shares tumble
8 percent, led by a hefty drop in shares of Piraeus Bank
<BOPr.AT>.
    The Greek bank association has not seen details of the
scheme, which media reports suggested could involve state
guarantees on bonds issued by the SPVs and sold to distressed
debt funds.
    ""I am not aware of any discussion going on these days
between the Greek government and (EU) institutions on solutions
that would involve state guarantees,"" said a European Union
official.
    Should such a plan for sour loan disposals get EU clearance
it would help banks shrink their mountain of so-called
non-performing exposures (NPEs), or bad loans, faster.
    Bad loans are the biggest challenge facing the Greek banking
sector. At the end of June they had fallen by 4.1 percent from
the first quarter to 88.6 billion euros ($102 billion) or 47.6
percent of banks' overall loan book.
    Banks have been under regulatory pressure to tackle the bad
debt problem, which restricts their ability to expand credit and
help the economy's recovery.
    Greek lenders had bad loans totalling 14.5 billion euros or
5.5 percent of all their loans, when the global financial crisis
began in 2008.
    Bad loans then soared to 106.9 billion euros or 50.5 percent
of all loans by the end of June 2016.
    Banks have agreed with ECB regulators to take steps to
shrink them to 64.6 billion euro by the end of 2019, meaning the
NPE ratio would fall to 35.2 percent of all loans on their
books.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Patrick Drahi may
sell part of his telecom group’s fibre broadband business,
having recently offloaded some mobile towers. The cash could
reduce debt and increase capex. But ceding control over
investment decisions to private equity could undermine the
business model over time.

    By George Georgiopoulos
    ATHENS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Greece is working on an asset
protection scheme to help its banks offload soured loans, and
shared the details with EU competition authorities and banking
supervisors, bankers and government officials said on Thursday.
    The scheme would involve setting up special purpose vehicles
(SPVs) where billions of euros of bad loans would be transferred
from banks' balance sheets to help speed up the clean-up
process.
    ""There is such a plan that has been prepared by the HFSF
bank rescue fund some time ago,"" one senior banker told Reuters
on Thursday, declining to be named.
    ""The plan has been shown to the government, European
authorities and SSM banking supervision,"" the banker said.
    A government official who declined to be named said the
state was looking at the possibility of an asset protection
scheme, not a bad bank. ""We are considering the asset protection
scheme as part of a wider strategy for bad loans,"" the official
said.
    While the government was mulling the possibility, a second,
senior government official said Athens was ""not looking into
such solutions soon"", adding that fundamentals did not justify a
market selloff on Wednesday that saw bank shares tumble 8
percent, led by a hefty drop in shares of Piraeus Bank
<BOPr.AT>.
    
    EU HURDLE
    Bad loans are the biggest challenge facing the Greek banking
sector. 
    At the end of June they had fallen by 4.1 percent from the
first quarter to 88.6 billion euros ($102 billion) or 47.6
percent of banks' overall loan book. They had totalled just 14.5
billion euros or 5.5 percent of loans when the global financial
crisis began in 2008.
    Approval of the type of asset protection plan that is under
discussion would help banks shrink their mountain of
non-performing exposures faster, but there are concerns that EU
competition authorities might reject it as a form of state aid.
    The HFSF (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund), which holds
stakes in Greek banks after taking part in three
recapitalisations, would not confirm whether such a scheme was
ready to go into operation if it got EU clearance.
    ""All this talk about an asset protection scheme is ideas...
There is no final, concrete plan,"" an HFSF official told
Reuters.
    The Greek bank association has not seen details of the
scheme, which media reports suggested could involve state
guarantees on bonds issued by the SPVs and sold to distressed
debt funds.
    ""I am not aware of any discussion going on these days
between the Greek government and (EU) institutions on solutions
that would involve state guarantees,"" said a European Union
official.
    Banks have been under regulatory pressure to tackle the bad
debt problem, which restricts their ability to expand credit and
help the economy's recovery.
    Banks have agreed with ECB regulators to take steps to
shrink bad loans to 64.6 billion euro by the end of 2019,
meaning the NPE ratio would fall to 35.2 percent.

    LUXURY STOCKS: WITH HINDSIGHT, THEY HAD IT COMING? (1503 GMT) 
    Quite an interesting note with hindsight from Northern Trust Capital Markets on Kering.
Analyst Ameet Patel wrote on Tuesday: ""We suspect even a hint of deceleration in earnings
momentum could be disproportionately punished, it may just take a set of numbers, guidance which
aren't blow out."" 
    Well, it seems the new concerns over a slowdown in China have done just that by knocking
luxury shares and in particular Kering, which is sinking over 5 percent. 
    Among signs Kering was losing momentum, Patel noted a fall in relative price momentum:

    AFTERNOON SNAPSHOT: DANSKE CLOUDS BANKING PARTY, LUXURY HIT, DAX UP (1248 GMT)
    We're more than half way through the trading session and while the broader pan-European
STOXX 600 index is still trading near where it was late morning, down 0.7 percent. 
    Beyond the surface there have been some interesting moves.
    Banks have managed to extend their gains as Italian lenders join the yield boost party,
although a drop in Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> is clouding somewhat the positive mood.
    Danske was last down nearly 4 percent as it faces a criminal investigation in the U.S. over
a 200 billion euro money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch. [nL8N1WK1GP]
    The stock now looks somewhat cheap but pressure is likely to continue.
    ""With the U.S. investigation now underway, and given the scale of flows, it's likely to take
time before we get clarity on the outcome, leaving the shares with an overhang near term,"" say
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts Richard Smith and Edward Firth.
    Meanwhile, luxury names have come under a bit of pressure as it seems traders are fretting
over a possible slowdown in China ahead of next week's third-quarter results from heavyweight
LVMH <LVMH.PA>, which is down 4 percent and set for its worst day since June 2016. [nL8N1WK3A6]
    ""The outlook (from LVMH) could be more cautious or somewhat negative due to uncertainty
surrounding China,"" says Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets.
    A positive note comes from the DAX <.GDAXI>, which has moved slightly into positive
territory, helped by its banks and autos.

    IS ITALY'S DEBT AS RISKY AS U.S. HIGH YIELD? SERIOUSLY? (1204 GMT)   
    Well if you take the assumption that markets are always right and priced to perfection than
yep, sure, whatever...
    The fact is a junk-rated U.S. corporate bond is now priced roughly the same as sovereign
debt from Italy -- the euro zone's third-biggest economy which carries a rating two notches
above junk.      
    ""Complacency? Most probably"", notes LBPAM strategist Stephane Deo in his morning note. 
    Here's a chart showing how the spread between U.S. high yield and 5-year Treasuries compares
with that of 10 year Italian debt and Germany's Bund.   
      
 
 
 
    As a bonus here's a funny take from the MacroTourist newsletter on why Italy and Greece are
two very different things:

    WHY EUROPE'S NO LONGER A BUND YIELD PLAY (1000 GMT)
    Surging yields is the buzz word on markets today and Credit Suisse strategists led by Andrew
Garthwaite are out with a timely view on the how the long-standing correlation between European
stocks and Bund yields has broken down.
    Continental Europe used to be a play on Bund yields, they say, recalling that when yields on
German government rose, Europe outperformed in dollar terms 80 percent of the time.
    But why is this no longer the case and what does it mean for investors?
    ""Underlying this has been a weakening in the relationship between financials and Bund yields
as banks are facing a range of issues including Italy, GEM exposure and disruption,"" they say. 
    On top of that, European banks now just weigh 10 percent total market capitalisation and
that has pushed the correlation between banks and European equities to fall sharply to 0.2 from
0.9.
    To conclude they say: ""we can be overweight banks (on value grounds) even as we see Bund
yields rising and stay underweight of Continental Europe"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SHARES DOWN AS MARKETS MULL FED RATE HIKE PROSPECTS (0719 GMT)
    European shares started the day in the red, with all major benchmarks down between 0.2-0.5
percent as markets digested remarks by Jerome Powell, the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman, that it
may raise interest rates amid strength in the world's biggest economy. [nN9N1LO00F]
    European banks <.SX7P> bucked the trend, climbing 0.2 percent as they followed gains for
their Asian and U.S. counterparts. Europe's personal and household goods and food and beverage
sectors were the biggest fallers in early trade, down 2 and 1.2 percent respectively.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: BANKS, IPO ACTIVITY, UK RETAILERS (0643 GMT)
    European shares are set to open lower today as markets reprice expectations for a rate hike
in the U.S and monitor development in Rome where budget details are being hammered out. 
    Futures were trading down 0.2-0.6 percent, putting the STOXX on track to fall back to the
lower-end of the past two weeks' trading range.
    From the corporate world there is no major news so far although there is some IPO activity
(Neoen, LeasePlan and Eurotorg) that could catch investors' attention following the
disappointing market debut of Aston Martin. 
    Also on the watchlist are shares in European banks after their peers in Asia and the US rose
on the back of rising U.S. Treasury yields. 
    In results, UK retailers are in focus as Ted Baker posted a 3.5 percent rise in half-year
revenue, while DFS Furniture reported a 48.5 percent fall in full-year pretax profit, hurt by a
summer heat wave. On trader has called Ted Baker to open down 1 percent and DFS down 2 percent.

    European shares are expected to open mixed today after gains in the previous session on
relief after the Italian government signalled it would lower its budget deficit from 2020. 
    The mixed open would come as the dollar hit an 11-month high on the yen after strong U.S.

 poll data

    BELGRADE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank is
expected to keep its benchmark rate at 3 percent on Monday as it
looks to maintain a steady rate of economic growth and keep
inflation on a stable footing, a poll showed on Thursday. 
    All 12 analysts and traders polled by Reuters this week and
last said the central bank would leave borrowing costs
<RSCBIR=ECI> unchanged when its executive board meets on Monday.
 It also kept rates on hold last month.
    Serbia's economy <RSGDPY=ECI> grew 4.8 percent in the second
quarter and 4.6 percent in the first quarter. 
    On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund raised its
growth forecast for the Balkan country this year to 4.2 percent,
up from 3.5 percent, on the back of increased private
consumption, investments and exports. [nL8N1WK2RG]
    Inflation <RSCPIY=ECI> rose to 2.6 percent in August, up
from 2.4 percent a month before, but remained within the central
bank's target corridor of 3 percent, give or take 1.5 percentage
points.
    ""The bank will maintain the key rate as it wants to prevent
certain weakening of the dinar,"" said Sasa Djogovic, an
economist with the Belgrade-based Institute for Market Research
(IZIT). 
    Despite stronger economic growth, the central bank is not
seen raising rates any time soon. Lower rates could add further
stimulus to the economy but would also weaken the currency, both
of which would add inflationary pressures. 
    Serbia's dinar has been under appreciation pressure for much
of this year, requiring the central bank to buy euros, the
preferred foreign currency, on the local interbank market to
maintain a tight trading range. 
    Those appreciation pressures have started to ease in recent
weeks, however, due to higher corporate demand for euros and an
end to sales of dinar-denominated bonds for 2018, dealers said. 
    A Reuters currency poll on Thursday suggested the dinar
would ease 0.4 percent versus the euro in the coming year to the
rate of 118.8. [nL8N1WJ44A]    
    As part of its policy-making considerations, the central
bank is also keeping an eye on international markets, given the
expected end of bond purchases by the European Central Bank and
a continuation of hawkish policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
    ""With the rate on hold, the central bank also wants to keep
state maturities attractive to investors who could shy away from
emerging markets and turn to safer bonds,"" Djogovic said.

 (Adds details, updates prices)
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sterling rallied on Thursday as
investors bet Britain and the European Union were moving closer
to an agreed position on a deal for Brexit and a way to avoid
extensive border checks in Ireland.
    The pound hit a 2-1/2-month high versus the euro and rose
above $1.30 against the dollar.  
    Most of the gains came after a European Union source told
Reuters new British proposals for avoiding extensive border
checks in Ireland after Brexit were ""a step in the right
direction"" and ""make finding a compromise possible"".
[nL8N1WK2GW]
    That followed other signs this week that London is making
progress towards a Brexit agreement before Britain quits the EU
in March.
    Britain is trying to overcome one of the thorniest issues in
the Brexit negotiations: a ""backstop"" deal to protect an open
border between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and
EU member Ireland, should the UK leave the EU without an overall
exit agreement.
    The Financial Times reported that Ireland backed one of UK
Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals - for the whole of the UK
to operate within a customs union with the EU - if no other
solution to the Irish border issue was found [nFWN1WK03F].
    MUFG analysts said that rather than weaken as feared during
this week's conference of May's ruling Conservative Party,
sterling had been given a boost by the Irish reports.
    ""The EU would have to provide some encouragement as well
that it is warming to the idea for the pound to stage a rally in
the coming weeks,"" they said.
    May's conference speech on Wednesday lacked anything new to
shift market sentiment and had little impact on the pound
[nL8N1WJ1NV].
    After falling as low as $1.2922 <GBP=D3> overnight - its
weakest since Sept. 10 - sterling rallied to as high as $1.3041,
up 0.8 percent on the day.
    Versus the euro the pound rose 0.4 percent at 88.40 pence
<EURGBP=D3>, its strongest since July 16.
    In her speech, May appealed to her party to unite behind her
plan to leave the EU, warning critics their disputes could put
Brexit in jeopardy. 
    May's officials plan to rush her Brexit deal through
Parliament to stave off a rebellion from her own party,
Bloomberg reported on Thursday [nFWN1WK031].
    There also appears to be a considerable way to go before
London and Brussels can agree a deal. European Council President
Donald Tusk on Thursday sharply criticised what he called
""emotional"" and ""insulting"" statements about the EU by British
ministers and urged London on Thursday to accept an offer of
very close post-Brexit ties. [nL8N1WK3T0]
    ""Somehow, everything seems to be rather deadlocked at the
moment, and as a result the downside risks for sterling remain
in place,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients.
    The pound is likely to be stronger by the time Britain
leaves the EU, according to currency strategists polled by
Reuters, but in a year it still won't have recouped its losses
since the 2016 Brexit vote [nL4N1WJ1V8].

states

states

    By Krisztina  Than
    BUDAPEST, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hungary and Poland said on
Thursday they have gone to the European Court of Justice to
challenge tighter European Union rules on the employment of
workers from low-pay EU states.
    The issue of so-called ""posted"" workers has divided poor
east and rich west EU states for years, with France leading
efforts to tighten rules while Poland and Hungary have sought to
block reforms.
    A new EU directive, announced in July, would limit the right
of citizens from poorer member states to work in richer ones on
a low salary. 
    That reform ""does not serve the protection of posted workers
but in fact ... is a tool for protectionism,"" the Hungarian
government said in statement on Thursday, adding that it had
gone to the European Court of Justice to get the directive
annulled. 
    Poland said that it had also challenged the reform in the
ECJ.
    ""Poland has submitted its own complaint regarding the posted
workers directive on Oct. 3. We underline its protectionist
character. The assumptions of the Hungarian complaint are
similar,"" Polish state-run news agency quoted Deputy Foreign
Minister Konrad Szymanski as saying.
    France wants to overhaul the system which allows ""posted""
workers to be employed in other EU countries on contracts that
need only guarantee the host country's minimum wage, and allow
taxes and social charges to be paid in a worker's home nation.
    ""Posted"" workers make up only 1 percent of the EU workforce,
with many employed in haulage and construction.
    France, however, has complained that central and eastern
Europe gains an unfair advantage from the ""social dumping"" of
cheap labour, arguing that posting low-paid workers hurts local
jobs and erodes labour protections in higher-wage member states
like France and Germany. [nL8N1LA3M2]
    Hungary said on Thursday that the EU directive violated the
freedom of provision of services set out in the bloc's Treaty.

    SAO PAULO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - French retailer Casino

Brazilian press reports that said it had hired a financial

and the advisory firm named in the reports also denied them.
    Newspaper Valor Econômico reported that Casino had hired
financial advisory group Rothschild & Co SCA to explore asset
sales for the purpose of debt reduction. 
    Rothschild said in an e-mail to Reuters the information was
incorrect and Casino has not hired it to explore asset sales.

look at the sale of both Casino's Brazilian and Colombian
operations.
    The French bank was hired in 2016 to help GPA sell its
electronics retailer Via Varejo SA <VVAR3.SA>, sources familiar
with the talks have said, but those efforts have so far been
unsuccessful. In morning trading, shares in Via Varejo were down
5 percent, among the biggest decliners on the Sao Paulo stock

 (Adds luxury stocks, closing prices)
    By Danilo Masoni and Julien Ponthus
    MILAN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European shares suffered their
biggest fall in a month on Thursday as global stock markets came
under pressure from surging bond yields.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark index closed
down 1.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> fell 1.5
percent, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> declined 0.4 percent and the
UK's FTSE <.FTSE> retreated 1.2 percent. 
    Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. services sector activity
raced to a 21-year high in September, lifting Treasury yields to
their highest since mid 2011 on rising expectations for more
U.S. rate hikes. That in turn boosted euro zone government bond
yields on Thursday. [nL8N1WK16B] 
    ""The Treasury yield is commonly seen as the risk-free rate
for investing, so an increase tends to be negative for other
asset classes including shares,"" said Russ Mould, investment
director at AJ Bell. 
    A negative open on Wall Street where the S&P 500 <.SPX> and
the Nasdaq <.NDX> were down 0.8 percent and 1.7 percent 
respectively by 1540 GMT contributed to dampen the mood in
Europe.       
    Defensive companies were hit by the prospect of rising
yields, which make their steady dividend streams less appealing.
    Shares in European luxury goods companies were also among
the worst performers due to persistent concerns over a slowdown
in China.
    France's Kering <PRTP.PA> tumbled 5.4 percent, while rival
LVMH <LVMH.PA> was down 4.9 percent and Britain's Burberry
<BRBY.L> slid 5.6 percent. 
    In contrast, financials tend to benefit from rising rates
and bond yields as they help banks earn fatter margins on their
traditional lending business. 
    German lenders Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> and Deutsche Bank
<DBKGn.DE> rose 3.5 and 1.5 percent respectively, as German
10-year bond yields hit a 4-1/2 month high. 
    Italian banks <.FTIT8300> rose 1.1 percent as investors
monitored developments in Rome, where the government is trying
to finalise budget details after clashing with the EU over its
deficit targets. 
    Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> dropped 4.6 percent after
news it was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice
over a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal
involving its Estonian branch. [nL8N1WK1EB]
    ""They are a perfect example of how regulators come down hard
on banks who appear to have broken the rules,"" said Markus
Huber, trader at City of London Markets.
    Among top movers on the STOXX was Danish maker of diagnostic
devices Ambu <AMBUb.CO>, which fell 14.7 percent after a
strategy update. 
    Among few stocks making it through the day unscratched was
British pharmaceutical firm BTG <BTG.L>, which rose 5.1 percent
after it upgraded its sales forecast.

    By Lesley Wroughton
    WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday
imposed sanctions against a Turkish-based company, its top
directors, and a North Korean diplomat, accusing them of trading
in weapons and luxury goods  with Pyongyang in violation of
international sanctions.
    The latest sanctions come as Washington maintains pressure
on Pyongyang to dismantle its missile and nuclear programs. U.S.
sanctions have targeted North Korea's trade routes in an effort
to choke off funding for the weapons programs. 
    The U.S. Treasury said in a statement that SIA Falcon
International Group, which also has a branch in Latvia, would be
blacklisted for exporting weapons into or from North Korea.
    It also listed SIA Falcon Chief Executive Huseyin Sahin and 
its general manager, Erhan Culha, for having ""acted or purported
to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly SIA Falcon.""
    Additionally, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Ri Song
Un, the economic and commercial counselor at North Korea's
embassy in Mongolia. It said SIA Falcon officials hosted Ri
earlier this year in Turkey to negotiate weapons deals with him.
    Calls to SIA Falcon's offices in Istanbul seeking comment
went unanswered, and calls to its office in Latvia were met with
a pre-recorded message in Arabic.
    ""SIA Falcon International Group and individuals acting on
its behalf are blatantly attempting to flout longstanding UN
sanctions on trade in weapons and luxury goods with North
Korea,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
    The company's operations span defense, livestock, energy and
food products, according to the SIA Falcon website. It described
itself as ""one of the biggest companies ... in the defense
industry,"" saying it supplied armed services and security forces
of more than 30 nations on five continents.
    U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heads to Pyongyang on
Sunday to resume negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un on dismantling the country's missile and nuclear programs.
[nL2N1WJ1JF]
    Part of the talks will focus on a second summit between Kim
and President Donald Trump, possibly later this year.
    The two leaders met in Singapore in June, where Kim pledged
to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. His
actions, however, have fallen short of Washington's demands for 
irreversible steps to give up an arsenal that potentially
threatens the United States.

    It's official, rising U.S. yields are taking their toll across global stock markets. 
    Still, the current ""equity risk premium"" readjustment going on in the light of attractive
""risk-free"" bonds is nothing like the February correction. Yet?

    LUXURY STOCKS: WITH HINDSIGHT, THEY HAD IT COMING? (1503 GMT) 
    Quite an interesting note with hindsight from Northern Trust Capital Markets on Kering.
Analyst Ameet Patel wrote on Tuesday: ""We suspect even a hint of deceleration in earnings
momentum could be disproportionately punished, it may just take a set of numbers, guidance which
aren't blow out."" 
    Well, it seems the new concerns over a slowdown in China have done just that by knocking
luxury shares and in particular Kering, which is sinking over 5 percent. 
    Among signs Kering was losing momentum, Patel noted a fall in relative price momentum:

    AFTERNOON SNAPSHOT: DANSKE CLOUDS BANKING PARTY, LUXURY HIT, DAX UP (1248 GMT)
    We're more than half way through the trading session and while the broader pan-European
STOXX 600 index is still trading near where it was late morning, down 0.7 percent. 
    Beyond the surface there have been some interesting moves.
    Banks have managed to extend their gains as Italian lenders join the yield boost party,
although a drop in Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> is clouding somewhat the positive mood.
    Danske was last down nearly 4 percent as it faces a criminal investigation in the U.S. over
a 200 billion euro money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch. [nL8N1WK1GP]
    The stock now looks somewhat cheap but pressure is likely to continue.
    ""With the U.S. investigation now underway, and given the scale of flows, it's likely to take
time before we get clarity on the outcome, leaving the shares with an overhang near term,"" say
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts Richard Smith and Edward Firth.
    Meanwhile, luxury names have come under a bit of pressure as it seems traders are fretting
over a possible slowdown in China ahead of next week's third-quarter results from heavyweight
LVMH <LVMH.PA>, which is down 4 percent and set for its worst day since June 2016. [nL8N1WK3A6]
    ""The outlook (from LVMH) could be more cautious or somewhat negative due to uncertainty
surrounding China,"" says Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets.
    A positive note comes from the DAX <.GDAXI>, which has moved slightly into positive
territory, helped by its banks and autos.

    IS ITALY'S DEBT AS RISKY AS U.S. HIGH YIELD? SERIOUSLY? (1204 GMT)   
    Well if you take the assumption that markets are always right and priced to perfection than
yep, sure, whatever...
    The fact is a junk-rated U.S. corporate bond is now priced roughly the same as sovereign
debt from Italy -- the euro zone's third-biggest economy which carries a rating two notches
above junk.      
    ""Complacency? Most probably"", notes LBPAM strategist Stephane Deo in his morning note. 
    Here's a chart showing how the spread between U.S. high yield and 5-year Treasuries compares
with that of 10 year Italian debt and Germany's Bund.   
      
 
 
 
    As a bonus here's a funny take from the MacroTourist newsletter on why Italy and Greece are
two very different things:

    WHY EUROPE'S NO LONGER A BUND YIELD PLAY (1000 GMT)
    Surging yields is the buzz word on markets today and Credit Suisse strategists led by Andrew
Garthwaite are out with a timely view on the how the long-standing correlation between European
stocks and Bund yields has broken down.
    Continental Europe used to be a play on Bund yields, they say, recalling that when yields on
German government rose, Europe outperformed in dollar terms 80 percent of the time.
    But why is this no longer the case and what does it mean for investors?
    ""Underlying this has been a weakening in the relationship between financials and Bund yields
as banks are facing a range of issues including Italy, GEM exposure and disruption,"" they say. 
    On top of that, European banks now just weigh 10 percent total market capitalisation and
that has pushed the correlation between banks and European equities to fall sharply to 0.2 from
0.9.
    To conclude they say: ""we can be overweight banks (on value grounds) even as we see Bund
yields rising and stay underweight of Continental Europe"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SHARES DOWN AS MARKETS MULL FED RATE HIKE PROSPECTS (0719 GMT)
    European shares started the day in the red, with all major benchmarks down between 0.2-0.5
percent as markets digested remarks by Jerome Powell, the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman, that it
may raise interest rates amid strength in the world's biggest economy. [nN9N1LO00F]
    European banks <.SX7P> bucked the trend, climbing 0.2 percent as they followed gains for
their Asian and U.S. counterparts. Europe's personal and household goods and food and beverage
sectors were the biggest fallers in early trade, down 2 and 1.2 percent respectively.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: BANKS, IPO ACTIVITY, UK RETAILERS (0643 GMT)
    European shares are set to open lower today as markets reprice expectations for a rate hike
in the U.S and monitor development in Rome where budget details are being hammered out. 
    Futures were trading down 0.2-0.6 percent, putting the STOXX on track to fall back to the
lower-end of the past two weeks' trading range.
    From the corporate world there is no major news so far although there is some IPO activity
(Neoen, LeasePlan and Eurotorg) that could catch investors' attention following the
disappointing market debut of Aston Martin. 
    Also on the watchlist are shares in European banks after their peers in Asia and the US rose
on the back of rising U.S. Treasury yields. 
    In results, UK retailers are in focus as Ted Baker posted a 3.5 percent rise in half-year
revenue, while DFS Furniture reported a 48.5 percent fall in full-year pretax profit, hurt by a
summer heat wave. On trader has called Ted Baker to open down 1 percent and DFS down 2 percent.

at a forum in Istanbul. ""It is for us to go to 81 million people

    MOSCOW, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Russian Railways (RZhD) plans to
cut its stake in logistics firm Gefco to 40 percent in 2020 but
aims to retain control and continue consolidating its financial
results, according to Russian Railways' documents obtained by
Reuters.
    Gefco, whose main business is servicing the car industry, is
a former subsidiary of France's PSA Group <PEUP.PA>. The French
carmaker sold 75 percent of the company to Russian Railways in
2012 for 800 million euros ($921 million).
    In 2017, RZhD said it was considering selling down its stake
and that it would be happy with 50 percent plus one share.
    But according to a document enclosed in RZhD's strategy to
2025, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, the company now
expects to own a 40 percent stake in 2020.
    The document and the strategy have been sent to the Russian
government, which controls RZhD, for approval, an industry
source said. 
    It envisages, however, retaining control and continuing to
consolidate Gefco's results in its own financial statements. It
was not clear how RZhD planned to keep control after its stake
falls below 50 percent.
    A spokeswoman for RZhD said the company was considering
cutting its stake while retaining control in Gefco but declined
to provide any details.
    PSA, which still owns 25 percent of Gefco, said in March it
no longer needed its stake. [nL8N1R85DN]
    Company spokesman Pierre-Olivier Salmon said on Thursday
that the position had not changed, declining to comment further.

    NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The head of Poland's top
insurer, PZU SA <PZU.WA>, said on Thursday he expects more
consolidation in the local banking sector with two to four
transactions potentially taking place in the next year.
    ""Even though (earnings) margins have now picked up somewhat
and the average ROE (return on equity) in the banking sector is
around the European average of 7 to 8 percent, I think there are
some players in Poland who are sub-scale who either want to get
bigger or get sold,"" PZU Chief Executive Officer Pawel Surowka
told Reuters in an interview.
    Speaking on the sidelines of an event sponsored by the
state-run firm in New York, Surowka said investors were waiting
to see if Eurobank, the Polish banking unit of France's Societe
Generale <SOGN.PA> would be put up for sale. [nL8N1TE4C4].
    Asked if one of PZU's banks, Alior Bank <ALRR.WA>, was 
going to bid for Eurobank, Surowka skirted a direct answer but
said Alior ""is a player who should participate in the
consolidation of the market.""
    He said Alior's strengths include a strong post-merger
integration unit and scalable information technology systems.
    ""The question is whether Societe Generale will discuss with
them at all and whether Alior will be interested. As an
investor, in general, we support them,"" he said, referring to
Alior and their efforts to ""growing further un-organically.""
    Eurobank is the 17th largest Polish bank with assets at 
mid-year of roughly 14 billion zloty ($3.7 billion). That is
more than 20 times smaller than the country's largest lender PKO
BP. <PKO.WA>
    ""It all comes down to numbers. What are the synergies, what
are the conditions?"" Surowka said.
    PZU also holds a large stake in Bank Pekao <PEO.WA>, the
nation's second largest lender. In August the bank said it had
ended talks on a potential merger with Alior. Asked if would be
wise for Pekao to merger with PKO BP, Surowka was circumspect.
    ""The situation where Poland has two strong local domestic
leaders, that compete with each other, is beneficial to them
because it forces them to innovate, to improve,"" he said.
    When pressed further, he appeared to squash the prospects of
a linkup, saying it ""might be a little bit too cozy ... not the
best idea.""
    But on the general idea of acquisitions by PZU, Surowka said
the healthcare sector as well as its core insurance markets in
emerging Europe are where deals are more likely to be made in
2019.
    ""I think health is one (where) we will constantly be on the
lookout,"" he said.

    BERLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - German exports unexpectedly fell
in August, data showed on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that
manufacturers in Europe's largest economy have shifted into a
lower gear over the summer months.
    The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted
exports edged down by 0.1 percent on the month, missing a
Reuters forecast of a 0.3 percent rise. Imports dropped by 2.7
percent, undershooting a predicted 0.2 percent fall.
    The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 18.3
billion euros ($21.02 billion) in August from 15.9 billion in
the previous month, the data showed.
    Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the
flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 15.3 billion
euros from 15.1 billion euros in July, unadjusted data showed.
    The trade figures chimed with manufacturing data released on
Monday that showed industrial output edged down unexpectedly in
August, suggesting the German economy lost steam in the third
quarter.
    Economists are taking an increasingly pessimistic view of
the German economy, with the top German institutes last month
revising down their 2018 growth forecast and warning that an
escalation of trade friction involving the United States could

    WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE THE OPEN (0650 GMT)
    The bounce in Chinese stocks after a heavy sell-off on slowdown worries may help European
shares recover from the six-month lows hit yesterday, with stock index futures trading up
0.1-0.2 percent as the focus slowly moves to the reporting season.
    Earnings updates from German fintech company Wirecard and Swiss fragrance maker Givaudan
could provide support. Wirecard shares are up 4.9 percent in pre-market trade after the firm
said core profits would grow sixfold by the middle of the next decade, while Givaudan is up more
than 1 percent as Q3 sales rose 9.8 percent, slightly beating analyst forecasts. 
    Ceconomy however is seen taking a bit hit after Europe's biggest consumer electronics
retailer said 2017-18 operating profit came in below its targets.
    Earnings in Europe are expected to show double-digit growth in the third quarter but remain
below the stellar rate seen for Wall Street. According to Refinitiv IBES data, earnings growth
for euro zone companies on the STOXX 600 is seen at 11.8 percent, nearly half the 21.5 percent
expected for the S&P 500.
    Dealmaking could also animate the session with plastic packaging maker RPC Group giving two
competing private equity suitors more time to make bids, while sources said Volkswagen may soon
hire four banks to advise on a listing of its truck unit.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO BOUNCE SLIGHTLY (0515 GMT)
    European shares are expected to bounce back at the open today after hitting six-month lows

    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Arlene Foster, head of the
Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which props up Theresa
May's government, heads to Brussels today for three days of
potentially decisive talks in the Brexit saga. Foster is due to
meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier and diplomats from other EU
states, with discussions to focus on the Irish border issue that
have created an impasse in the wider negotiations. Foster, whose
small party has the power to bring down the government, repeated
her demand for there to be no regulatory divergence between
Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, but added that a deal
looked ""eminently possible"". 
    Emmanuel Macron is seen reshuffling his cabinet as early as
today after the resignation of his interior minister in protest
at the president's imperious leadership style. Allies are
pushing for a substantial revamp to try and draw a line under a
tumultuous few months that have seen his poll ratings slump. Yet
a reshuffle presents Macron with a delicate balancing act. While
a big rejig covering key posts such as the finance and foreign
ministries might deliver a message of renewal, it could also be
seized on by opponents as an admission of failure. It comes as
trade unions organise demonstrations today against his reforms.
    The eurozone was not spared as the IMF cuts its growth
forecasts for this year and next across the board due to growing
protectionism and troubles in emerging markets. The region saw
its 2018 growth forecast cut to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent
previously, with Germany particularly hard hit by a drop in
manufacturing orders and trade volumes. The new forecasts,
released on the Indonesian resort island of Bali where the IMF
and World Bank annual meetings are getting underway, show that a
burst of strong growth, fueled partly by U.S. tax cuts and
rising demand for imports, was starting to wane: it now predicts
3.7 percent global growth this year and next, down from its July
forecast of 3.9 percent growth for both years.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
    World markets remain on edge after a nervy start to the week
in holiday-sapped trading on Monday. The International Monetary
Fund chimed with the tension by downgrading its global economic
growth forecasts for this year and next to 3.7 percent from 3.9
percent, talking of ‘plateauing’ of the world economy and
raising red flags about rising trade barriers, tightening dollar
funding and stress in emerging markets. Wall St stock indices
closed little changed on Monday night, with government and
Treasury markets shut for the Columbus Day holiday. But with
markets increasingly convinced the incoming U.S. economic news
warrants four more Federal Reserve interest rate rises between
now and the end of next year, 10-year Treasury yields resumed
their steep climb to new 7-year highs on Tuesday, hitting 3.2520
percent earlier and pushing the 2-10 year yield curve to its
steepest since June - at almost 37 basis points. The dollar
strengthened across the board overnight as a result, with only
Japan’s yen outperforming among the major currencies as stock
market tensions rose in Asia. 
    Returning from Monday’s holiday, Japan’s Nikkei lost more
than 1 percent but Chinese benchmarks stabilised after their
worst one-day fall on Monday in more than two years amid worries
about trade and tech sector friction with the United States.
China’s yuan recovered some ground from Monday’s 7-week lows,
hit after the latest weekend easing of bank reserve requirements
by the People’s Bank of China. The offshore yuan was a touch
weaker early in London trade, but off its worst levels from
Monday at 6.9371 per dollar. The dollar was generally higher
against other Asia currencies such as India’s rupee, Indonesia’s
rupiah and Malaysia’s ringgit. MSCI's benchmark emerging market
equity index was in the red for the fourth straight session.
Pakistan’s rupee tumbled some 8 percent in an effective
devaluation by the central bank and as the finance minister said
the government would seek to open talks with the IMF this week
on emergency financial assistance – despite recent efforts by
the government of PM Khan to avoid a second bailout programme in
five years. 
    U.S. stock futures were slightly lower and European
equivalents higher after the latter suffered heavy losses on
Monday amid fresh worries about the standoff between Rome and
Brussels over Italy’s planned budget loosening. Ten-year Italian
government yields briefly touched a new 4-1/2 year high of 3.628
percent first thing before retreating amid reports the
government was set to launch an investor roadshow to support the
bond market. Italy’s deputy PM Salvini, meantime, said the
government would not change its budget plans. South Africa's
rand lifted off lows as a Treasury spokesman said embattled
finance minister Nene will travel to Indonesia for this week’s
IMF meeting despite reports on Monday he was set to resign.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italy's benchmark 10-year
government bond yield edged off a 4-1/2-year high on Tuesday on
hopes that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria will strike a moderate
tone when defending the government's contentious budget plans in
parliament on Tuesday. 
    Italian government bonds were sold off heavily on Monday as
a war of words between Rome and the European Union over Italy's
spending plans escalated. 
    But Tria is generally perceived as more wedded to budget
discipline than some of the other members of the government.
    ""People are starting to buy (Italian BTP) futures on hopes
Tria will strike a more conciliatory tone when he defends the
budget in parliament today,"" said Commerzbank rates strategist
Christoph Rieger.     
    Jean-Christophe Marchado, a fixed income strategist at
Natixis, agreed, saying: ""Everybody knows that Tria is market-
friendly and has fought for conciliation between the EU and
Rome.""        
    In addition, a Milan-based trader attributed the drop in
yields to a report saying Italy's parliamentary budget office is
set to reject the government's budget plan, though such a move
would not be binding. [nL8N1WP0ZI]
    Italy's 10-year government bond yield dropped two basis
points in early trade to 3.55 percent, while the spread over
Germany hovered around the 300 basis point mark, three bps
tighter on the day. Monday had seen some of the widest levels in
five years. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR> 
    Short-dated two-year bond yields <IT2YT=RR> were 4 bps lower
at 1.78 percent and five-year yields <IT5YT=RR> were 4.5 bps
lower at 2.94 percent. 
    Also on Tuesday, a La Stampa report said that Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte and Tria could do a roadshow to support Italian
government bonds. [nL8N1WP0O9]
    Market participants will also be keeping a close eye on an
Italian bond auction on Thursday. Italy's debt agency said on
Monday it would offer up to 6.5 billion euros over four bonds.
[nI6N1VP02J]
    Higher-rated euro zone bond yields rose on Tuesday,
following another rise in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which
hit a fresh seven-year high of 3.256 percent in Asian trade.
<US10YT=RR> 
    U.S. Treasury yields have been rising on the back of a
strengthening economy and on expectations the Federal Reserve
will continue to hike rates as a result. 
    German and French 10-year government bond yields were up a
basis point each at 0.55 percent and 0.89 percent respectively.

    BERLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A hard Brexit would result in
extra tariffs of more than 3 billion euros ($3.44 billion) for
German companies per year, a German institute said on Tuesday,
adding that German exports to Britain could drop by up to 57
percent.
    Talks on ending four decades of Britain's membership in the
European Union have entered their final stage, more than two
years after Britons voted narrowly for Brexit in a referendum.
Britain and the EU are eyeing significant progress in
negotiations at an Oct. 17-18 summit. [nL8N1WO2RR]
    The IW economic institute in Cologne said a hard Brexit
would hit the auto sector - which employs some 800,000 people in
Germany and is the country's biggest exporter - particularly
hard as it would be hit with around 60 percent of those extra
costs.
    IW said around 5 percent of Germany's gross domestic product
depended either directly or indirectly on trade with Britain,
making it the third most important trading partner for German
firms.
    But IW added: ""That could dramatically change in the
foreseeable future.""
    Referring to a potential plunge in German exports to Britain
if a hard Brexit happens, IW researcher Markos Jung said: ""This
horrific scenario should force politicians to act
constructively."" 
    In the long term, a hard Brexit would probably result in
price rises and a shift in Germany's flows of goods, the IW
said.

    * Energy prices and wages to lift CPI next year
    * Analysts see central bank keeping to rate hike path

 (Adds central banker Hampl, more details)
    PRAGUE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Czech consumer prices in September
fell the most on a monthly basis since 2015 due to deep
discounts for holiday tours and train tickets, a small respite
from inflationary pressures that continue to keep rate hikes in
the cards.
    The drop was larger than expected and put the year-on-year
inflation rate at 2.3 percent <CZCPIY=ECI>, closer to the
central bank's 2 percent target but unlikely to knock it off a
path of normalising monetary policy.
    After the data, central bank Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl -
viewed as the biggest proponent of steady rate hikes but whose
final term on the Czech National Bank's seven-member board ends
soon - said there was little reason to change his view.
    ""It is clear that in this phase of the economic cycle, and
its expected development, a return to normal monetary policy
must continue,"" Hampl said while visiting a university to give a
lecture. He added he would likely vote for a hike at the next
meeting on Nov. 1. 
    ""We will see what the new outlook will bring but... there
would have to be something really major to change my view.""
    The export-oriented economy has grown quickly in recent
years, propelled by rising household consumption as unemployment
has fallen to the lowest levels in the European Union at around
3 percent, and wages are rising at their fastest rate in 15
years.
    The central bank has raised its key two-week repo rate
<CZCBIR=ECI> at its last three meetings, to 1.50 percent. Since
ending a four-year-old intervention regime keeping the crown
weak in 2017, the bank has lifted rates from near zero in six
steps, the most aggressive tightening in the European Union. 
    Markets see chances of another hike before the end of the
year. Most analysts do, too, given higher energy prices will
start showing up more in inflation next year and stronger wage
demands will further boost price pressures.    
    Inflation has been above the central bank's 2 percent
mid-point target for much of the past two years.
     
   
    The statistics office said the year-on-year growth in prices
last month had been caused mainly by higher food prices. 
    The monthly drop was influenced by deeper discounts than in
past years on holiday package prices. The government also
introduced cheaper rail and bus tickets for students and seniors
last month, leading to a decline in transport prices.
    Komercni Banka's head economist Viktor Zeisel said inflation
could approach target in the coming months before growing again.
    ""The central bank also sees that inflation will pick up,"" he
said. ""This means it will continue with normalising monetary
policy. We expect rates will rise again this year in November.""

    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The British pound drifted nearly
half a percent lower on Tuesday on the back of a stronger dollar
and as investors booked profits after last week's rally on
rising hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations.
    The British pound <GBP=D3> edged 0.4 percent lower at
$1.3041 nearing a one-month low hit last week. Against the euro
<EURGBP=D3>, the British currency was 0.2 percent weaker at
87.86 pence.
    ""The pound can definitely move higher from current levels
but the markets are waiting for news on a substantial
breakthrough in Brexit negotiations and until that materializes,
we are trapped in a range,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist
at ING in London.
    European Union negotiators said on Friday an agreement with
Britain was ""very close"" and European Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker said on Saturday a deal would be reached in
November, if not this month. [nL8N1WM05D]
    While hedge funds have bought the pound in recent days,
overall short positions on the currency are at their highest
levels in 16 months, according to futures data.
    Many investors have preferred to sit on the sidelines rather
than try to profit amid the political unpredictability and the
currency's sharp price swings.
    Mike Amey, head of sterling portfolios at fund management
giant PIMCO, said he held a moderately long position on sterling
versus the euro, predicting a gradual rise over the next 12-18
months, because the market was ""too pessimistic"" about prospects
for a disruptive Brexit. [nL8N1WO338]
    Its losses have been smaller against the euro as concerns
about a row between Brussels and Rome over Italy's proposed
budget deficit targets have added to the euro's woes in recent
sessions. [FRX/]

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Hungary's 10-year government
bond yield jumped to a 3-year high on Tuesday as U.S. and Bund
yields rose and Hungary's annual inflation rate increased to its
highest level since early 2013.
    Debt yields rose across Europe including the European
Union's eastern members after the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
<US10YT=RR> set seven-year highs above 3.25 percent.
    Hungary's corresponding yield traded at 3.86 percent, up 14
basis points from Monday's fixing and the highest since 2015.
    ""The causes were a rise in core market yields and the
higher-than-expected inflation figure,"" one Budapest-based fixed
income trader said.
    Hungary's annual inflation increased to 3.6 percent in
September, a tad above expectations and a 5-and-1/2-year high.
    The forint <EURHUF=> eased slightly against the euro after
the figures and other data showing a smaller-than-expected trade
surplus in August.
    The government sold 3-month Treasury bills at a negative
yield after the figures, at -0.03 percent, slightly up from
-0.05 percent in a sale a week ago. 
    Analysts said inflation could stay above 3 percent, the
mid-point of the Hungarian central bank's (NBH) 2-4 percent
target range in the coming months, even though a higher 2017
base in crude prices may ease upwards pressure in the rest of
the year.
    The inflation rise is unlikely to trigger a change in the
NBH's monetary policy as core inflation remains moderate, even
though it picked up to 2.4 percent from 2.2 percent in August,
analysts said.
    Hungary's trade surplus could drop by 850 million euros this
year to 7.2 billion euros, but could still support the forint in
the rest of 2018, Takarekbank analyst Andras Horvath said in a
note.
    Polish and Czech government bond yields rose by 2-3 basis

limit bond auctions in the rest of the year. [nL8N1WP2AO]
    The zloty <EURPLN=> and the Czech crown <EURCZK=> shed 0.1
percent against the euro as a weakening of the yuan weighed on
risk appetite in global markets. 
    Warsaw's bluechip stock index <.WIG20> still rose 0.5
percent, rebounding from a 3-week low.
    The crown's loss remained moderate even though September
Czech figures released on Tuesday showed the biggest monthly
fall in consumer prices since November, 2015. [nL8N1WP1BW]
    The 2.3 percent annual figure, after August's 2.5 percent,
is closer to the Czech central bank's 2 percent target, but is
unlikely to prevent further hikes in the bank's interest rates, 
analysts said.
    The bank's Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl said it may increase
interest rates again at its November meeting, underpinning
market expectations. [nP7N1SO00M]

    Italian yields have risen sharply in recent weeks on fears
the coalition spending plans are unsustainable. Tria told a

the government was ready to act if things got out of hand.

    * She wanted her show to carry out investigations
    * Bulgarians angry at corruption in country's judiciary

    SOFIA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Bulgarian police have detained a
suspect in connection with the murder of TV journalist Viktoria
Marinova, whose body was found in a park in her Danube hometown
of Ruse, a government source familiar with the investigation
said on Tuesday.
    ""We can say there is a suspect detained,"" the source told
Reuters without elaborating.
    An interior ministry spokeswoman declined comment. The
prosecutor's office said three additional prosecutors were being
sent to Ruse to back up the investigation.
    Prosecutors have said the 30-year-old journalist, who was a
presenter and anchor on a local television station, had been
raped, beaten and suffocated. Marinova's body was found in a
park near the river in her hometown, Ruse, on Saturday.
[nL8N1WN0YB]
    On her last aired TV show, on Sept. 30, Marinova introduced
two journalists who were investigating alleged corruption
involving EU funds. She said her regional current affairs show,
""Detector"", would carry out similar investigations.
    While authorities have not established any link to her work
so far, her murder has angered and upset many in a country where
people are frustrated with rampant corruption and an inefficient
and graft-prone judiciary, for which Sofia has been repeatedly
criticised by the European Commission.
    Early on Tuesday, civilian volunteers combed bushes and
ground along the Danube river in Ruse where Marinova's body was
found in an effort to find clues that could help police. 
    Local people observed a vigil overnight and lay flowers and
lit candles in front of her image. Many were stopping to put
flowers to commemorate Marinova, who left a seven-year-old
daughter, on Tuesday. 
    ""This is extremely frustrating. We do not feel safe at all
or calm when such things happen. I did not know her personally ,
but as a mother I can only feel for her,"" said 28-year-old
Denitsa Peicheva. 
    The European Commission urged Bulgaria on Monday to conduct
a rapid investigation into the killing.

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italy will do whatever is necessary
to restore calm if market turbulence turns into a financial
crisis, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Tuesday, calling
for more measured debate over government budget plans.
    The coalition last week set a deficit target of 2.4 percent
of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous goal for the
heavily indebted nation, unnerving investors and prompting sharp
criticism from the European Commission.
    Addressing a parliamentary commission, Tria said fears over
next year's budget plan were unjustified. However, he said the
government would act if the spread between its benchmark 10-year
bond yield and the equivalent German bund balloons.
    ""In the face of a financial crisis, the government will do
what it must do, as (ECB president Mario) Draghi did,"" Tria
added, referring to a promise the central bank chief had made in
2012 to do whatever it took to save the euro currency. 
    His words failed to reassure the market, with 10-year yields
hitting a 4-1/2 year high <IT10YT=RR>, pushing the premium
investors demand for holding the bonds over top-rated Germany
paper to around 312 basis points, its widest in five years.
[nL8N1WP2A1]
    The European Commission warned last week that Italy's
deficit plans represented ""a significant deviation from the
fiscal path recommended by the Council"". [nL8N1WM0IR]
    The leaders of the two ruling parties, Luigi Di Maio and
Matteo Salvini, denounced the Commission position and said they
would not backtrack on their spending plans, including tax cuts
and a significant boost in welfare. [nR1N1VZ00V]
    Tria, who is a university professor and is not affiliated to
either coalition party, said the strategy adopted by previous
governments to contain debt had not been efficient, adding that
Italy needed to do more to boost growth and employment. 
    However, he said he wanted to lower the tone with Brussels.
    ""There will now be a constructive discussion with Europe to
show the well-founded reasons for this government's growth
strategy,"" he said.
    Underscoring the anxiety in Europe, European Commission Vice
President Jyrki Katainen told reporters on Tuesday that Italy
was highly vulnerable.
    ""We are concerned that Italy will present totally
unrealistic fiscal targets or growth projections, and that
negotiations will prove very difficult,"" he said in Helsinki.
    The government says its expansive budget will boost growth
and it has targeted output of 1.5 percent next year, which is
strong by Italy's chronically sluggish standards, 1.6 percent in
2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
    ""These targets are prudent,"" said Tria, brushing off
widespread criticism from independent analysts who have said
they were overly optimistic.
    ""(We will) significantly reduce, within the first two years
of this legislature, the growth gap with the eurozone and bring
about the first significant decrease in the debt ratio over the
next three years,"" Tria said.
    At around 131 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), Italy
has the highest debt ratio in Europe besides that of Greece.
Tria predicted this ratio would fall to 130.0 next year, 128.1
in 2020 and 126.7 in 2021. [nL8N1WL29P]
    The Bank of Italy said on Tuesday there was always a risk of
a vicious circle over debt costs, with repercussions for the
real economy.
    ""Given the (debt's) size and the need to service each year a
not insignificant amount (about 400 billion euros), the danger
of triggering a vicious circle ... with repercussions on the
real economy, is always present,"" Bank Director General Luigi
Federico Signorini told the parliamentary commission.

    * GRU expected to press on with operations  

    By Andrew Osborn
    MOSCOW, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Russia's military spies are being
mocked abroad as bunglers but the army's influence over Kremlin
foreign policy is growing and there is little likelihood it will
halt its ""black operations"".
    The GRU military intelligence agency is blamed by the West
for several botched attacks this year, including attempting to
kill former spy Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent in the English
city of Salisbury and trying to hack the global chemical weapons
watchdog in the Netherlands. [nL8N1WK35D] 
    Russia's denials of wrongdoing have at times caused 
incredulous laughter in the West and some of the world's media
have cast the GRU, which helped annex the Crimea peninsula from
Ukraine in 2014, as blundering amateurs. [nR4N1WJ01T]
    But Western intelligence experts and Russian sources
familiar with policy-making in the Kremlin say the West must
stay on its guard. [nL8N1WO5OW]
    ""It’s easy to laugh at some of the GRU’s poor tradecraft and
their ability but we should not underestimate them nor indeed
the dangerous and reckless use of nerve agent on our streets,""
British Security Minister Ben Wallace told a security conference
in Britain on Tuesday. [nL8N1WP2S3]
    Intelligence experts say the GRU has stepped up its
activities including black operations - covert missions that are
not attributable to the organisation carrying it out - as
tensions mount between Russia and the West, which has imposed
sanctions on Moscow over the annexation of Crimea.
    ""What Russia is doing is operating by wartime rules which
means particularly that the GRU has been let off the leash,""
said Mark Galeotti, a fellow at the European University
Institute in Florence. 
    ""As the East-West confrontation worsens that empowers these
combative agencies and the GRU is being much more active,"" he
said, adding that the GRU at times had freedom to choose how
best to carry out orders from higher up.      
    If the West hopes public shaming will prompt President
Vladimir Putin to muzzle the GRU, whose official emblem features
a bat hovering above the globe, it is likely to be disappointed.
    A source close to the Defence Ministry, who declined to be
named, said the GRU would continue its work. 
    ""We are under attack,"" said the source. ""We need to be
robust.""
    Asked on Monday if there would be a shake-up at the defence
ministry, Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the low quality
of the allegations levelled at GRU did not justify such changes.
    ""Russia believes there's no point in reducing the GRU's
activities because that would be a unilateral concession that
would not yield anything and probably be seen as a sign of
weakness,"" said Tatyana Stanovaya, who is well connected to the
political elite and runs political analysis firm R.Politik. 
    ""I think that malicious operations could even be conducted
more often than in the past,"" she said.
    The Kremlin is dismayed by fraying informal communications
channels between Western and Russian intelligence agencies, she
said, and sees the espionage world as a realm without rules.
    Putin, a former intelligence officer himself, sounds
defiant. He said last week espionage was one of the world's most
important professions and dismissed Skripal as a traitor.
    Despite Western media allegations about the GRU's alleged
incompetence, there has been pride in some quarters in Moscow.
    ""If anyone had doubts that our employees work everywhere
they shouldn't have any now,"" Konstantin Zatulin, a lawmaker,
told state TV, while declining to confirm the allegations.  
        
    ""A FEW EMBARRASSING NEWS CYCLES""
    The attacks on the Organisation for the Protection of
Chemical Weapons in the Netherlands and on Skripal, in which the
former spy and his daughter were poisoned with the nerve agent
Novichok but survived, are not the only signs the West sees of
the GRU's increased activity.[nL8N1WK4W0]
    The United States has indicted seven suspected spies and the
 West has united to accuse the GRU of a global hacking campaign.
[nL8N1WK0Z5]
    Britain produced CCTV footage of the two suspects it says
tried to kill Skripal and investigative website Bellingcat on
Monday named the second suspect as a GRU military doctor after
earlier naming the first man. [nL8N1WO5JB] 
    The Netherlands has named the four suspected GRU agents it
says tried to hack the OPCW. 
    But there are no signs the Kremlin is more than momentarily
embarrassed by the GRU's public woes, Galeotti said.  
    ""I suspect that the Russian calculation is that if it's just
a few embarrassing news cycles, some tough words, and a bit of
embarrassment we can just ride this out,"" he said.
    From a Russian perspective, Vladimir Frolov, a former senior
Russian diplomat, said the GRU's blunders were not a disaster.
    ""What was shown was nothing more than working hitches in
extraordinarily risky but effective operations which achieved
their main aims,"" Frolov wrote in Russia's Republic magazine.  
    The GRU has become much more active since the annexation of
Crime because of a broader foreign policy. 
    Before 2014, Moscow mainly confined itself to the former
Soviet Union. But since then, Russia has become more active in
the Middle East and Africa, while the United States and European
countries have accused Moscow of interference in their affairs.
    There are other signs of the army's rising influence besides
the uptick in the GRU's activity.   
    Particularly vocal on Syria, where Russia helped turn the
tide of war in President Bashar al-Assad's favour, the Defence
Ministry was out of the traps even before the Kremlin when
Syrian forces accidentally shot down a Russian military plane
last month, accusing a ""hostile"" Israel of causing the incident.
    Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was also one of only two
companions Putin took with him when he went hiking this summer,
the other being the head of the FSB security service. Shoigu,
63, is not involved in party politics but opinion polls often
put him among the most popular presidential possibles.
    In another sign of the military's and his own growing
influence, Shoigu has ordered a giant cathedral dedicated to the
armed forces to be erected in Moscow and only last week spoke of
the need to create a second capital city in Siberia.
    ""The army's influence will rise,"" said R.Politik's
Stanovaya. ""Putin believes Russia is in a state of war.""

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 09: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Transelectrica SA's 
Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook.

The affirmation reflects Transelectrica's conservative balance sheet and 
earnings supported by Romania's regulated asset base (RAB) regulation for 
electricity transmission, with the third regulatory framework running until 
mid-2019. The current regulatory environment stimulates investments in the 
network, with more than RON3 billion of investments planned by 2023, which we 
expect will result in increased leverage. The rating reflects Transelectrica's 
standalone credit profile (SCP), but we view any upside as limited by the links 
to Romania (BBB-/Stable), its 58.7% shareholder.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

SCP Supports the Rating: Fitch evaluates Translectrica's links with the Romanian 
state under the criteria for Government-Related Entities (GRE). We view its 
status, ownership and control as strong and support as weak, while we assess 
socio-political implications and financial implication of a potential default of 
the GRE as moderate and weak, respectively. Transelectrica's SCP supports its 
rating being one notch above the sovereign rating, reflecting our assessment of 
their legal and operational links as weak under the Parent and Subsidiary Rating 
Linkage criteria. 

Weak Legal and Operational Links: The transmission network is a strategic asset 
for Romania, but Translectrica operates independently from the government with 
the members of the Supervisory Board selected by an independent HR company 
through a transparent process. The legacy loans guaranteed by the government, 
which represented 12.5% of total debt at end-2017, are due to mature by 2020. 
Fitch expects Translectrica to continue to finance its operations independently 
without cross-defaults provisions with the government. 

The transmission services in Romania are regulated by Autoritatea Nationala de 
Reglementare in Domeniul Energiei (ANRE) by applying a transparent methodology 
to tariff calculations without direct government interference. Translectrica's 
future dividend payments will continue to be influenced by the government as a 
majority shareholder, but we assume that its capex funding needs and covenants 
in existing loan documentation will continue to be prioritised. 

Capex to Drive Leverage: We consider the credit metrics as strong for the 
rating, despite an ambitious capex programme totalling over RON3 billion by 2023 
and our assumption for steady dividends, which may drive Translectrica leverage 
ratios to around 3.5x, up from 0.5x in 2017. 

Earnings Volatility: Transelectrica's earnings are more volatile than peers, as 
tariffs are set based on estimated parameters after which adjustments are made 
with one or two years delay for volumes and non-controllable costs pass-through. 
The swings may go either way: this regulatory period started with higher 
allowances in 2014 which have been reversing towards the end of the price 
control in June 2019. It is possible that the next price control may address 
this issue and look to further eliminate the discrepancy between the cost base 
and the tariff calculation. Some volatility also occurs due to zero profit 
activities on the balancing market and other pass-through items. 

Fourth Regulatory Period: The next regulatory period is expected to start in 
July 2019. There have been no formal communications on the key parameters for 
the next review, but Fitch assumes that the main regulatory and remuneration 
mechanisms will remain broadly unchanged. However, in our forecast we 
conservatively assume a lower allowed return of 5.6%, in line with data recently 
published by ANRE for the calculation of the allowed WACC for electricity 
distribution. The potential lower allowed WACC could be balanced by the proposed 
introduction of a capacity based transmission fee which should stabilise 
revenues by reducing the exposure to energy volumes.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Transelectrica is the regulated transmission operator in Romania. The company 
benefits from RAB-based regulation, comparable with other European frameworks, 
but the return is set at 7.7% pre-tax real, a level much higher than in other 
countries. Exposure to significant ex post adjustments creates cash flow 
volatility. Transelectrica's close peer is Redes Energeticas Nacionais, SGPS, 
S.A.'s (REN; BBB/Stable), the transmission system operator for gas and 
electricity in Portugal and the largest gas distributor. We consider REN to be 
better diversified and to have better cash flow visibility than Transelectrica, 
but it has significantly higher leverage.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

 Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer

- 3% negative transmission volume deviation, the maximum shortfall which will 
not be reimbursed

- 5% controllable operation and maintenance overspend

- No efficiencies achieved in grid losses (2% p.a. target)

- Stable dividends at RON166 million per year

- New debt interest of 3.5%

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

-Fitch views Transelectrica's rating as capped at 'BBB', one notch above the 
Romanian state (BBB-/Stable) due to its links with the state. We assess 
Transelectrica's standalone profile to be commensurate with a 'BBB' rating. 
Therefore, positive rating action could occur if Transelectrica's standalone 
credit profile improves and the Romanian sovereign is upgraded.

Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- Stronger links with the government, or a downgrade of the Romanian sovereign 
rating 

- A material change in the existing debtholder protective measures currently in 
place with a more aggressive capital structure, for example FFO adjusted net 
leverage above 5.0x, fixed charge cover below 3.5x and net debt/RAB above 70%

- Material changes in the regulatory framework which may adversely impact 
Transelectrica's profitability

RATING SENSITIVITIES FOR ROMANIA 

The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive 
rating action are: 

-Reduced risks of macroeconomic instability

-Implementation of fiscal consolidation that improves the long-term trajectory 
of public debt/GDP

-Sustained improvement in external finances 

The main factors that could, individually or collectively, trigger negative 
rating action are:

-Persistent high fiscal deficits leading to a rapid increase in government 
debt/GDP 

-An overheating of the economy or hard landing that undermines macroeconomic 
stability

LIQUIDITY

Adequate Liquidity: At the end of 1H18, Transelectrica had RON546 million of 
cash and cash equivalents from which RON41 million was restricted for 
connections fees and for high efficiency cogeneration deposits. 2018 outstanding 
maturities were around RON219 million including the RON200 million bond maturing 
in December 2018. Tranelectrica also has available RCF of RON100 million, 
renewable on a yearly basis.

parties on Tuesday voted against each other in the regional
parliament for the first time in three years, a sign that
tensions over the strategy to adopt towards Spain's central
government are becoming more serious.
    Quim Torra, the Catalan regional head and Junts per
Catalunya (JxCat) member, last week threatened to withdraw
parliamentary support for Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez
in the national parliament, but coalition ally Esquerra
Republicana de Catalunya (ERC, Republican Left of Catalonia) did
not back the move.
    ERC leader Oriol Junqueras, who is currently in jail for his
alleged role in organising an illegal referendum on independence
for the Catalonia region last year, said establishing a good
relationship with the Spanish state and finding ""dialogue and
agreements"" was the best way to resolve the secession crisis.
    While the two parties had so far managed to resolve their
tensions internally, they openly split on Tuesday when ERC
teamed up with the socialist party to defeat a proposal of JxCat
to allow exiled and jailed representatives to vote in the
regional parliament.
    Junqueras and another jailed ERC member, Raul Romeva, had
previously agreed to transfer their votes to a member of their
party, in line with a ruling from Spain's Supreme Court.
    It is not yet clear whether those cracks could spell the end
of the three-year-old pro-independence coalition, which controls
the regional assembly and helped Sanchez win a confidence vote
and topple conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy in June.
    Junqueras on Twitter on Tuesday urged the two parties to
stick together while JxCat said it would hold an extraordinary
meeting on Friday to review its strategy.
    Polls in Catalonia show a relatively even split between
those who favour remaining in Spain and those wanting to secede.
Sanchez has said he favours dialogue on the region's future but
has ruled out any moves towards independence.

    By Daphne Psaledakis
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union nations,
voicing concern over a U.N. report on global warming, agreed on
Tuesday to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, as
Germany warned that overly challenging targets risked harming
industry and jobs.
    Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry
competitiveness, EU environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg
talked for more than 13 hours until nearly midnight to reach a
compromise over what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to impose on
Europe's powerful carmakers.
    The final rules will now be hashed out in talks beginning on
Wednesday with the EU's two other lawmaking bodies: the European
Parliament, which is seeking a more ambitious climate target,
and the European Commission, which proposed a lower one.
    In a joint statement earlier, the EU ministers expressed
deep concern over a U.N. report calling for rapid and
unprecedented action to contain global warming but held back
from increasing their pledge to reduce emissions under the 2015
Paris climate accord. [nL4N1WO1TL]
    Several countries had sought a higher, 40 percent reduction
in car emissions, in line with targets backed by EU lawmakers
last week [nL8N1WJ305], with Ireland and the Netherlands among
those voicing disappointment with the compromise deal.

worldwide. [nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    Germany, with the backing of eastern European nations, had
held a blocking minority among the 28 nations against the more
ambitious targets, EU sources said.
    But a last-minute amendment helped ease concerns among
poorer member states over the new rules, which also create a
crediting system encouraging carmakers to raise sales of
electric cars. [nL8N1WJ305]
    It would allow for a different accounting in countries where
the current market penetration of zero- and low-emissions
vehicles is less than 60 percent below the average in the bloc.

    CLIMATE AMBITION
    Curbs on the transport sector, the only industry in which
emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its goal
of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990
levels by 2030.
    Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this
summer have fuelled concerns climate change is gathering pace,
leading some countries to call for emissions to be cut at a
faster rate than planned.
    But a call by the EU's climate commissioner and 15 EU
nations for the bloc to increase its pledge to cut emissions by
45 percent under the Paris accord has met with resistance.
[nL8N1VH0FI]
    Ahead of U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, the
bloc's 28 environment ministers renewed their commitment to
leading the fight to limit global warming.
    They said the EU was ready to ""communicate or update"" its
Nationally Determined Contribution, the efforts by each country
to reduce emissions, by 2020.
    Raising it would require the approval of all 28 nations.
    That may be too hard to achieve before the U.N. talks,
European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said, but the
bloc is likely to exceed its Paris pledge following a reform of
its Emission Trading System (ETS) and new targets on renewable
energy and energy efficiency.
    ""We do not need new legislation on this one because
everything is already done. We are just going to get better
results than expected,"" Sefcovic told Reuters on Monday.

    By Lindsay Dunsmuir
    Oct 10 (Reuters) - Risks to the global financial system have
risen over the past six months and could increase sharply if
pressures in emerging markets escalate or global trade relations
deteriorate further, the International Monetary Fund said on
Wednesday.
    The IMF, whose autumn meetings with the World Bank get under
way on the Indonesian resort island of Bali this week, also
noted that while the banking system has been shored up by
regulators in the decade since the 2008 global financial crisis,
easy financial conditions are contributing to a buildup of
vulnerabilities such as high debt levels and ""stretched"" asset
valuations.
    New bank resolution regimes meant to avoid future bailouts
are largely untested, the Fund said in its biannual global
financial stability update.
    ""Near-term risks to global financial stability have
increased somewhat,"" the IMF said. ""Overall, market participants
appear complacent about the risk of a sharp tightening in
financial conditions.""
    IMF capital markets director Tobias Adrian said potential
shocks to the system could come in many forms, such as
higher-than expected inflation that triggers a sharp jump in
interest rates or a ""disorderly"" exit by Britain from the
European Union.
    But the severity of the impact from such shocks will be
determined by vulnerabilities including growing non-financial
debt levels now exceeding 250 percent of GDP, a decline in
underwriting standards outside the traditional banking sector
and elevated asset prices that could drop sharply.
    ""It's this interaction between the buildup of
vulnerabilities and the decline in asset prices that can
generate adverse implications for macroeconomic activity,""
Tobias told a news conference.
    The rapid build-up in debt in China in recent years also is
a concern, although Chinese authorities have taken steps to rein
in debt growth, he said.
    In the report, the IMF said economic growth appears to have
peaked in some major economies while the gap between advanced
countries and emerging markets was widening. The IMF on Tuesday
cut its global growth forecasts due to an escalating U.S.-China
trade war and growing financial strains on emerging markets
[nL2N1WP03N]
    The United States continues to grow strongly and the Federal
Reserve raised interest rates for the seventh time in the last
eight quarters at its latest policy meeting in September. U.S.
stock markets are also at record highs.
    That contrasts with a slowing in the euro area and Japan.
China's economy is also showing signs of moderating and that
could be exacerbated by its trade disputes with the United
States, which has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of
imports from Beijing and is threatening duties on $267 billion
more.
    The normalization of monetary policy in the United States as
well as a stronger dollar and escalation in trade tensions has
already begun to affect emerging market economies, the Fund
said.
    New IMF research shows emerging market countries excluding
China could face debt portfolio outflows of up to $100 billion,
a level last seen during the global financial crisis.
    The Fund cited a number of other near-term risks to
financial stability including the possibility of a ""no-deal""
Brexit or renewed fiscal policy concerns in some highly indebted
euro area countries.
    It also urged global regulators to keep in place measures
taken since the financial crisis and both heighten supervision
of market liquidity and raise the amount of capital banks have
to set aside to cushion any downturn.
    ""The financial regulatory reform agenda should be completed,
and a rollback of reforms should be avoided,"" the Fund said. ""To
adequately address potential systemic risks, financial
regulation and supervision should be used more proactively.""

    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Even before any Brexit deal has
been concluded between the UK and Brussels, attention is turning
to whether it will get through a delicately balanced UK
parliament. With the support of the Northern Irish DUP, Theresa
May has a majority of just 13 but various estimates put at 40
the number of Conservative MPs who are prepared to defy her and
vote down any deal. Set against that are reports in The Times
and FT this morning that between 30-40 Labour lawmakers would
rebel against their party leadership and back May's deal for
fear that the alternative is a dire, no-deal Brexit. There is
still a long way to go on this one: the party whip system under
which various forms of pressure and inducements are applied on
recalcitrant parliamentarians has yet to make itself fully felt.
    What has happened to Emmanuel Macron's cabinet reshuffle,
originally expected on Monday and then put back to yesterday?
Finally a statement emerged from the Elysee yesterday evening to
say that it would not be happening just yet; Macron is due to
hold a regular cabinet meeting this morning before he heads off
on an official trip to Armenia. The opposition is having a field
day, accusing him of dithering and making a huge fuss over
something which is largely a presentational move. One of the
downsides of having sprung open the established party system
with his En Marche movement is that Macron has not got an
obvious pool of ministerial candidates to choose from. And as
his government looks more and more uncertain in office, some
possible names are even ruling themselves out.
    Italian government officials have come out this morning to
insist there will be no change to the 2019 budget and its growth
targets after parliament's fiscal watchdog said the forecasts -
for 1.5 percent growth next year, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4
percent in 2021 - were too optimistic. The government can indeed
ignore that judgment, but if it does so parliament can call on
the economy minister to explain why.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    World markets’ volatile start to the week petered out
somewhat on Wednesday as key flash points in U.S. Treasuries,
emerging markets and Italian debt calmed down and eyes shifted
to critical U.S. inflation updates, debt auctions and the start
of the Q3 earnings season later this week. Sterling continued to
stand out as it pushed to its strongest levels in four months
against the euro and on a trade-weighted basis following a
series of reports that a Brexit deal between the European Union
and Britain could be reached as soon as next week. Italian
government bond yields and debt spreads versus Germany hovered
close to Tuesday’s closing levels and off their highest levels
this week after finance minister Tria said the government would
act if bond market pricing became excessive and European banking
monitors said stepped-up surveillance of Italian banks’
liquidity position showed up no cause for alarm.

and unnerving world equity markets in the process, 10-year U.S.
Treasury yields slipped back to hover just above 3.20 percent
first thing Wednesday ahead of a 10-year auction later tonight.
With markets now starting to chime with Fed indications of
another four interest rate rises between now and the end of next
year, the release later today of U.S. producer price data for
September and the consumer price report tomorrow will be
important in determining the next twist in the bond market. Some
traders pointed to further criticism of the Fed overnight from
U.S. President Trump, who said the central bank was tightening
too fast, but the impact of that political pressure could just
as easily embolden Fed policymakers to stick to their course. 
    After cutting world growth forecasts this week by 0.2
percentage points for this year and next, the International
Monetary Fund’s Financial Stability Report on Wednesday
spotlighted the risks of mounting pressure points on the world
economy, not least various financial firestorms across the
emerging markets. Helped by a pause in rising U.S. yields and
step-back in the dollar on Wednesday, emerging market equities
turned slightly positive for the first time in five sessions.
Chinese stock markets and the yuan were flat during the day
after a seismic start to the week saw the biggest one-day equity
market fall in more than 2 years. Tokyo’s Nikkei ended
marginally in the black, but South Korea’s Kospi lost more than
1 percent amid some disappointment that the second summit
between Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un was delayed to
next month.  Emerging Asia currencies steadied too after a
torrid start to the week and Tuesday's effective devaluation of
Pakistan’s rupee. South Africa’s rand held most of Tuesday’s
sharp gains after news that former central bank chief Mboweni
would take over the job of finance minister after the
resignation of scandal-tainted incumbent Nene. Turkey’s lira was
also steady after the government announced a series of price
control measures and discounting to try to control runaway
inflation that hit almost 25 percent last month.

    ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The leaders of Italy's ruling
parties said on Wednesday they would not backtrack on plans to
increase deficit spending, digging in against financial market
and EU pressure and criticism from parliament's budgetary
watchdog.
    The comments came before Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
returned to speak in parliament at 1000 a.m. (0800 GMT) about
plans to fix next year's deficit at 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product.
    That is three times the forecast of the previous centre-left
administration, drawing criticism from the European Commission
and triggering a sharp rise in yields on Italian government
bonds.
    Tria is returning parliament for a second day after Italy's
fiscal watchdog, the parliamentary budget office (UPB), on
Tuesday refused to validate the government's multi-year budget
plan, saying its forecasts for economic growth were too
optimistic.
    The planning document projected growth targets of 1.5
percent next year, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
    Both leaders of the ruling coalition said they would not
give in to pressure.
    On RAI state radio, anti-establishment 5-Star Movement
leader Luigi Di Maio said he would not ""betray"" Italians by
changing the budget plan.
    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini, speaking on RAI
state TV, warned ""speculators"" against betting that the
government would climb down.
    Salvini said ""a few big financial institutions"" are ""betting
that Italy will backtrack (on the budget). They're wrong"".

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Italian bond yields rose again on
Wednesday, with investors turning their attention to the
country's credit ratings outlook after a senior Moody's
Analytics economist told a newspaper that Italy's budget plan
was ""a mistake."" 
    Italian bond yields rose up to 11 basis points in early
trade following a volatile session on Tuesday. 
    Analysts attribute the move to the La Stampa newspaper
report citing Mark Zandi. [nL8N1WQ0PY] Moody's Analytics is a
subsidiary of the credit agency that focuses on non-ratings
activity.
    A downgrade of the Italian debt by credit rating agencies is
possible, a prominent lawmaker of the ruling League party said
on Wednesday, as market concern over the financial
sustainability of the new government budget targets mounted.
    Leaders of the ruling coalition, Luigi di Maio and Matteo
Salvini, on Wednesday reiterated that the budget would not be
amended.
    ""Investors are very sensitive regarding the ratings
outlook,"" said Rene Albrecht, rates strategist at DZ Bank. 
    ""Any news about ratings actions is moving BTPs. Rome is not
just on a collision course with Brussels but also with the
ratings agencies.""
    Moody's and S&P Global, which both rate Italy two notches
above junk, are due to provide an updated opinion on Italy's
credit rating in the second half of October. Analysts say around
one downgrade is already priced in. [nL8N1WP4QO]
    ""The outlook after the downgrade is now the focus,"" said
Albrecht. ""It will be a volatile session again but we think the
government is now more spread-sensitive.""
    Analysts say that should the spread of Italy's 10-year bond
yield over Germany remain above a 300 basis point ""threshold""
the government would likely move to soothe markets.  
    The gap was at around 303 bps on Wednesday, having hit a
five-year high around 316 on Tuesday <DE10IT10YT=RR>.
    Italy's 10-year bond yield was six basis points higher on
the day at 3.59 percent but off 4-1/2 year highs hit on Tuesday
<IT10YT=RR>.
    
    Its two and five-year bond yields were around seven basis
points higher. <IT2YT=RR>, <IT5YT=RR>.
    Investors will be looking for further direction from Economy
Minister Giovanni Tria, who is due to speak at 10:00 am local
tome. Tria on Tuesday pledged to do whatever was necessary to
restore calm if market turbulence triggered a financial crisis,
helping to stem the selling of Italian bonds, known as BTPs.
    European banking supervisors have stepped up their
monitoring of liquidity levels at Italian banks after the sharp
increase in bond yields, though there was no cause for alarm, a
senior EU source said on Tuesday. [nL8N1WQ0XV]
    Elsewhere euro zone bond yields were up to one basis point
higher, with Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the
region, at 0.542 percent <DE10YT=RR>, <FR10YT=RR>.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro steadied near $1.15 and
away from seven-week lows on Wednesday as a fall in U.S.
Treasury yields took some steam out of the dollar's recent run.
    Rising Treasury yields and concern about the sustainability
of Italy's public finances after the ruling parties proposed a
budget criticised by the European Union [nL8N1WQ1DK] and have
fuelled another rally in the dollar in recent sessions, sending
the greenback to a 1 1/2-month high on Tuesday.
    That rally paused in European trading on Wednesday, although
analysts said it was likely to prove a temporary reprieve for
the euro.
    Investors are betting that rising inflation pressures will
keep the Federal Reserve, which unlike the European Central Bank
is hiking rates, firmly focused on tighter policy, even as U.S.
President Donald Trump took aim at policy makers' hawkish
inclinations.
    ""If U.S. yields rise at the same time and the market prices
in a slightly more aggressive Fed next year, that automatically
means that EUR/USD will head south,"" said Commerzbank analyst
Antje Praefcke.
    ""That means that short-term the dollar will continue to
remain bid. The euro has lost its shine and therefore has too
little to offer at present.""
    On Wednesday, the dollar index <.DXY> was largely unchanged
at 95.692, not far off 96.163 reached during the previous
session -- its highest level since Aug. 20.
    The euro hovered around $1.1486 <EUR=> having briefly pushed
past $1.15 in Asian trading hours. 
    Yields on Italy's 10-year bonds have hit a 4 1/2-year high
this week - reflecting concern about the country's finances -
despite encouraging comments from Italian Economy Minister
Giovanni Tria [nL8N1WP2A1].
    Tria said that Italy will do whatever is necessary to
restore calm if market turbulence turns into a financial crisis,
adding fears over the country's budget plan for next year were
unjustified [nL8N1WP21C].
    Elsewhere, other hard-hit currencies took advantage of the
dollar's pause, with the Australian <AUD=> dollar strengthening.
    Sterling hit a 3 1/2-month high versus the euro <EURGBP=>
after reports that Britain and the EU were making progress
towards a Brexit deal. The pound also rose against the dollar
<GBP=> [nL8N1WQ13S].
    Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond <US10YT=RR>
stood at 3.21 percent on Wednesday, after reaching a seven-year
top of 3.261 percent overnight.
    ""The rising U.S. bond yields have obviously provided support
to the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist
at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. ""On the short term, the dollar may
be sold, but I don't think that will last long. The dollar will
start to strengthen again."" 
    Against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the dollar edged higher,
trading up 0.1 percent at 113.06 yen. 
    China's offshore yuan <CNH=> gave up 0.1 percent to 6.9237
yuan per dollar, not far from the 6.9379 two-month lows touched
at the start of this week. 
    A Reuters poll released Wednesday showed China's onshore
yuan is forecast to pare some of its recent losses against the
dollar over the coming year on hopes that risks from the
U.S.-China trade war and a sell-off in emerging markets will
subside[nL4N1WO0MX].

    ATHENS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A drop in Greek bank shares was
caused by external factors, not the health of the country's
banks, the governor of the Bank of Greece said on Wednesday.
    Greek banking stocks have lost more than 40 percent so far
this year, and the selling pressure grew in recent days.
Analysts blamed the European Union's conflict with Italy over
its proposed budget [nL8N1WO2TI].
    ""The recent stock market developments in respect to the
banking sector are not related to the soundness of Greek banks
and are due to purely exogenous factors,"" Yannis Stournaras, the
head of the Greek central bank, said in a statement.
    Those factors include rising interest rates generally and in
Greece's neighbouring countries in particular.
    ""The ongoing improvement of the liquidity situation of Greek
banks reflects the improved condition of the Greek financial
system,"" Stournaras said.
    On Wednesday, the European Central Bank lowered the ceiling
on the emergency liquidity assistance -- funds that Greek banks
draw from the domestic central bank -- by 200 million euros to
5.0 billion euros ($5.74 billion).
    The move reflected improved liquidity, taking into account
private-sector deposit flows and banks' access to financial
markets, it said. The new ceiling is valid through to Nov 7.
    Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance
since February 2015 after being cut off from the ECB's funding
window. Emergency funding is more costly than borrowing directly
from the ECB.
    In June 2016, the ECB reinstated Greek banks' access to its
cheap funding operations, allowing lenders to reduce their
dependence on the emergency liquidity lifeline.
    But since Athens emerged from its bailout programme on Aug.
21, the ECB has ended a waiver that made Greek government bonds
eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

    By Gavin Jones and Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - When a senior representative of
Italy's ruling coalition met international investors over dinner
last week he was asked at the end of the evening if he had any
questions. He only had one: ""What would you do if Tria goes?""
    The episode shines a light on the precarious position of
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who looks weak and isolated
after caving in to party chiefs by agreeing to raise next year's
fiscal deficit far above levels agreed with Brussels.
    Tria had committed to holding the deficit below 2 percent of
gross domestic product but buckled under pressure from the
coalition to set a target of 2.4 percent in what was seen as a
humiliating defeat for the economics professor.
    He is now in the middle of a power struggle between his
paymasters from the right-wing League and the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement who need money to fulfil election pledges, and a
European Union that is insisting on fiscal constraint.
    Investors are nervous. Italian 30-year bond yields hit a
four-year high on Tuesday above 4 percent on concerns talks
between the coalition and Brussels could turn sour, with Tria,
the face of economic moderation, side-lined.
    ""Tria is a good and competent person but I don't think he
has yet fully understood his role,"" the coalition official said
at the dinner, attended by a Reuters reporter, in an exclusive
restaurant in Rome.
    ""He has tended to behave like the CEO of a private company
who can act autonomously, but it's not like that, this is a
political government, not a technocratic one,"" he said.
    Tria's spokeswoman said she would not comment on remarks
from unnamed people. She said the fact Tria had pushed for a
lower deficit target than was finally agreed was part of a
normal process of negotiation within governments everywhere.
    However, the awkward relationship between Tria and party
chiefs is likely to end within a few months, three political
sources said, either because Tria walks or because he is pushed.
    ""Tria wants to go, and we are fed up with him, but nothing
will happen before January because first we have to approve the
budget in parliament,"" a second senior coalition source said.
    Tria's spokeswoman said he had no plans to resign.
   
    DIFFERENT OPTIONS
    Officials from both the League and 5-Star have grumbled
frequently in private that Tria, a 70-year-old academic who is
not a member of either party, seems to have his own agenda.
    A virtually unknown economics professor at Rome's Tor
Vergata University https://web.uniroma2.it/home/newlang/english,
 Tria was drafted into the government as a last-minute
replacement for Paolo Savona, who was vetoed by the head of
state because of his criticism of the euro currency.
    Tensions came to a head over the budget, when 5-Star was
particularly exasperated with Tria's reluctance to fund their
flagship policy of a basic income for the poor.
    ""Nobody has asked for Tria's resignation, but I expect the
economy minister of a government for change to find the money
for Italians who are momentarily in economic difficulty,"" 5-Star
leader Luigi Di Maio said as relations soured.
    The senior official at the Rome dinner said he did not rule
out that Tria could remain in his post, but admitted that the
coalition partners had discussed different options on several
occasions.
    In the case of Tria's departure, the most likely successor
would be Massimo Garavaglia, a League lawmaker who is a deputy
economy minister, the official said. 
    Garavaglia is seen as a moderate, pro-euro pragmatist who
was formerly the budget chief of the wealthy Lombardy region. 
    ""Tria hasn't fitted in with our way of thinking,"" said a
third source, a 5-Star government member who asked not to be
named.
    
    WALK OR BE PUSHED?
    Tria may decide to walk, even if he is not pushed.
    An economy ministry source and an institutional source told
Reuters last week that Tria had told aides he planned to resign
after the budget has been approved by parliament at the end of
the year. Neither had spoken to Tria directly about the matter.
    Asked to comment, Tria's spokeswoman said he had no
intention of resigning at any time and had never expressed such
an intention to anyone.
    Tria's relations with 5-Star and the League had got off to a
bad start when he insisted on reappointing incumbents or naming
mainstream, economy ministry figures to key posts - riling the
new ruling parties who wanted to sweep away the establishment.
    ""Things started to fall apart in June over the public
appointments,"" the second coalition source said.
    The parties had painstakingly hammered out an agreement on
who should be named Treasury director general and the head of
state holding company Cassa depositi e prestiti https://en.cdp.it,
 only for Tria to intervene and demand fresh negotiations, the
source said.
    Suspicions then increased over the budget, with the minister
creating financial market expectations of a deficit target far
below what the parties were ready to accept.
    Tria's departure would be unlikely to go down well with
markets, even though his credibility as a guarantor of public
accounts has been damaged by his climbdown over the budget.
    In response to the coalition official's question at the
dinner in Rome, most of the investors from banks, asset managers
and hedge funds said they would be unhappy to see Tria go. Some
said they would wait to see who his successor was. Others said
they would sell some of their Italian assets.

    By Christopher Thompson
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Poor Frederic
Oudea. Last November, the boss of Société Générale <SOGN.PA>
unveiled a strategy reboot designed to eliminate the French
lender’s discount rating. At the time, SocGen shares were
trading at a 25 percent discount to the bank's tangible book
value. This year, a broader slide in European financial stocks
has pushed the discount to 30 percent.  Oudea must pass three
tests to reverse the slump. 
    The immediate challenge is to settle outstanding
investigations by American authorities, the last facing a big
euro zone bank. SocGen expects allegations it bust U.S.
sanctions will be resolved in the coming weeks and that any
fines will fall within 1.1 billion euros the lender has already
set aside, according to people familiar with the matter. 
    Sorting out SocGen’s misfiring traders is a tougher task.
Oudea wants earnings from the investment banking division –
about a third of the total – to become less volatile. This is a
work in progress. The unit’s operating profit fell by a whopping
27 percent year-on-year in the first half. This was mostly due
to an 18 percent decline in revenue from trading fixed income
securities, which brings in a quarter of the division’s top
line. Beefing up corporate treasury and prime brokerage services
should help to reduce the gyrations. In May, Oudea put deputy
CEO Severin Cabannes in charge of the investment bank to achieve
just that. 
    If Cabannes succeeds then SocGen’s target of earning an 11.5
percent return on tangible equity by 2020 looks achievable.
Assume the lender generates 25 billion euros of revenue this
year, its top line expands by around 3 percent a year while
annual cost inflation is 1 percent. After setting aside 1.1
billion euros for bad debts and applying a 27 percent tax rate,
net income in 2020 would be 6.84 billion euros, Breakingviews
calculates. On projected tangible equity of about 60 billion
euros, SocGen would hit its target. The bank’s shares should
then command a premium to tangible book value – a big uplift
from where they trade today. 
    Of course, the incoming US penalty could be larger than
expected or the investment bank could continue to underperform.
Right now, however, investors are prematurely assuming Oudea
will fail his tests.    
    On Twitter https://twitter.com/CGAThompson    

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Société Générale said on Sept. 4 it had entered into “more
active discussions” with U.S. authorities to settle the French
lender’s alleged violation of American sanctions. 
    - The bank, which has allocated 1.1 billion euros to the
dispute, said it hoped for a resolution within weeks. 
    - Chief Executive Frederic Oudea in May announced the
appointment of four deputy CEOs to improve returns as promised
by the lender’s three-year strategy announced in November 2017.
The plan, dubbed “Transform to Grow”, aims for SocGen to earn an
11.5 percent return on tangible equity by 2020, up from an
annualised 8.9 percent in the first half of 2018.

    SIGNS OF STRAIN AS BREXIT LOOMS OVER LONDON PROPERTY MARKET (1111 GMT)
    The latest wave of optimism on EU divorce talks will undoubtedly reassure those heavily
invested in UK real estate, arguably a no-deal proxy.    
    House sellers are cutting their prices in London and properties are staying on the market
for longer, UBS finds - a negative trend for property companies and housebuilders exposed to the
capital likely to see financial services jobs and EU nationals move away due to Brexit.
    In their analysis using web scrapes of residential property listings, UBS analysts find
reductions have risen to 37 percent of all listings from less than 20 percent in early 2016. The
level of discount in vendors' asking prices has widened to 2.4 percent, and the number of days
on the market has risen to 125 (see below).
    UBS also notes a clear trend with more expensive properties taking longer to sell, with the
widest discounts, calling Kensington & Chelsea ""an extreme case"". 
    The real estate slide may, however, be confined to London rather than spreading through the
country.
    ""In past cycles, a London downturn has pre-empted a wider loss of momentum and decline in
consumer confidence,"" analysts at the Swiss bank write. ""The BoE thinks this time may be
different, as the capital is more exposed than the national market to stamp duty changes and is
more likely to be impacted by the departure of EU nationals.""
    Indeed there's a further indication today of how Brexit is likely to sap demand from the
London property market: Britain's financial services minister says he expects 5,000 financial
services jobs to leave by Brexit Day [nL8N1WQ2F2]

    FOUR REASONS TO SELL LUXURY STOCKS (1003 GMT)
    Luxury is ""so last year"" - that's what Morgan Stanley analysts are saying, in a nutshell, in
a note which is partly responsible for the drop in stocks like LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler,
and Ferragamo today. 
    The selloff in luxury has been building over the past few weeks, and here are MS' four key
reasons to sell the sector. They say it's not too late to do so despite the recent falls:
    1. Luxury is vulnerable to underperformance of growth versus value - 92% of the sector is in
Europe's growth index
    2. Valuations remain elevated despite falling recently (see chart below), and investors are
still
heavily positioned in luxury
    3. Earnings momentum is slowing - analysts have begun downgrading earnings and sales
estimates
    4. China's consumer confidence may have peaked - Morgan Stanley's China economist expects
Chinese
consumption figures for the second half to slow further

percent sales growth in the third quarter. Other luxury stocks were also down sharply.
    Traders are linking the drop to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley, which has downgraded
the sector to underweight, saying it prefers value stocks over growth.
    ""We believe the recent outperformance of value vs growth has further to go and hence
downgrade the EU Luxury Goods sector to Underweight from a top down perspective,"" they say.

    NO MOOD SWING ON OUR RADAR (0651 GMT) 
    There's still a slightly negative trend for the futures and it looks like we are set for
another lacklustre start. There does not seem to be enough strong corporate headlines out there
to push the market either way or force a mood swing.

    Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved a deal on Wednesday between

    Just as fears the trade war is starting to take its toll on luxury goods, LVMH said its

    European futures have opened to an overall pale red picture even if this probably qualifies

    ""Uncertainty is prevailing in the financial markets, we are seeing more investors opting to
wait and see how risks surrounding rising US treasury yields, global growth and China play out"",
wrote Jasper Lawler of LDC in a morning note. 
    He added that while markets have been complacent for a while, ""we are starting to see an

    World stocks are still in touching distance of eight-week lows as worries about global
economic growth continue to dampen the mood.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Wednesday
near $1.15, moving away from seven-week lows after a fall in
U.S. Treasury yields took some steam out of the dollar's recent
run.
    Rising Treasury yields and concern about the sustainability
of Italy's public finances have fuelled another rally in the
dollar in recent sessions, sending the greenback to a 1
1/2-month high on Tuesday.
    That rally paused in European trading on Wednesday, although
analysts said it was likely to prove a temporary reprieve for
the euro.
    Investors are betting that rising inflation pressures will
keep the Federal Reserve, which unlike the European Central Bank
is hiking rates, firmly focused on tighter policy, even as U.S.
President Donald Trump took aim at policy makers' hawkish
inclinations.
    ""If U.S. yields rise at the same time and the market prices
in a slightly more aggressive Fed next year, that automatically
means that EUR/USD will head south,"" Commerzbank analyst Antje
Praefcke said.
    ""That means that short-term the dollar will continue to
remain bid. The euro has lost its shine and therefore has too
little to offer at present.""
    On Wednesday, the dollar index <.DXY> was largely unchanged
at 95.713, not far off 96.163 reached during the previous
session -- its highest level since Aug. 20.
    The euro hovered around $1.1497 <EUR=> having briefly pushed
past $1.15 in Asian trading hours. 
    Yields on Italy's 10-year bonds have hit a 4 1/2-year high
this week - reflecting concern about the country's finances.
[nL8N1WQ22W]
    Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria reiterated on
Wednesday that the government would do everything in its power
to regain the confidence of financial markets. [nR1N1VZ01R]
[nL8N1WQ1DK]
    European shares fell with investors in a nervous mood.
Markets have been buffeted by worries about the impact of the
U.S.-China trade conflict on economic growth, and rising U.S.
funding costs.
    ""A short-term risk rebound should be faded and used to get
back into JPY longs as rising bond yields will sooner or later
collide with the outlook for risky assets,"" Morgan Stanley
analysts said in a note. 
    The Japanese yen is traditionally viewed as a safe-haven
currency but has performed badly versus the U.S. currency
recently and remains near 11-month lows.
    Against the yen <JPY=>, the dollar edged higher, trading up
0.2 percent at 113.20 yen. 
    With risk sentiment souring, currencies deemed a play on the
global economy underperformed. The Australian dollar <AUD=> was
stuck at $0.7106, not far from its weakest since February 2016. 
    Sterling hit a 3 1/2-month high versus the euro <EURGBP=>
after reports that Britain and the EU were making progress
towards a Brexit deal. [nL8N1WQ13S]
    Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond <US10YT=RR>
stood at 3.22 percent on Wednesday, after reaching a seven-year
top of 3.261 percent overnight.
    China's offshore yuan <CNH=> gave up 0.2 percent to 6.9274
yuan per dollar, not far from the 6.9379 two-month lows touched
at the start of this week. 
    A Reuters poll released Wednesday showed China's onshore
yuan is forecast to pare some of its recent losses against the
dollar over the coming year on hopes that risks from the
U.S.-China trade war and a sell-off in emerging markets will
subside[nL4N1WO0MX].
    The Norwegian crown gained 0.7 percent against the dollar
<NOK=> to 8.2130 crowns, and 0.6 percent versus the euro to
9.4435 crowns, after Norway's inflation rate rose more than
expected in September [nEONIA80SS].

    By Emma Rumney and Sinead Cruise
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England has asked
lenders in Britain to provide six-hourly checks on their balance
sheets in the days after a possible ""no-deal"" Brexit as it seeks
to avert a sudden squeeze in credit supply, a senior industry
source said.
    The checks would cover deposits, loans, currency and
derivative exposures as well as any changes in the cost of
funding and lending rates, the source told Reuters.
    The central bank has been stepping up contingency planning
for a possible disorderly divorce from the European Union.
Negotiations between London and Brussels have so far failed to
produce a deal with barely six months to go before Brexit day on
March 29. 
    The Bank of England's supervisory arm for the banking
sector, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), had no
immediate comment. 
    A no-deal Brexit would erase legal infrastructure relied
upon by much of the financial sector, and could derail a shaky
UK economy. 
    The checks will also include telephone calls at regular
intervals where senior management can relay in real time the
money market impact of Britain's exit from the single market,
and the end of decades' worth of shared regulation and mutual
commercial interest.  
    Some banks responsible for supplying the lion's share of
credit to consumers and businesses in Britain are now preparing
for the 'worst-case' scenario, the source said. 
    ""The working assumption was that there will be something [in
terms of a deal], and now... they might simply time out,"" the
source said, describing the lengthy negotiations between Britain
and EU lawmakers.
    The PRA routinely increases monitoring of lenders around
significant events, and took similar measures when Scotland
voted on its membership of the United Kingdom in 2014 and the
Brexit referendum in 2016.

    BRATISLAVA, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Slovakia's government
approved a 2019 budget on Wednesday that aims for a faster
reduction in the fiscal deficit than initially planned due to
stronger economic prospects and higher tax collection.
    The three-party ruling coalition, led by leftist Smer, plans
to cut the deficit to 0.1 percent of gross domestic product next
year, the lowest level ever, down from an estimated gap of 0.6
percent this year.
    The approved budget plans see a balanced budget in 2020 and
then a first-ever surplus in 2021, coming at a time of fast
economic growth thanks to an expanding car sector in the euro
zone country and a fall in unemployment to new lows.
    Last month, the finance ministry said the state would see
higher tax collection than originally forecast, allowing for a
10 percent wage hike for public sector workers and the
introduction of benefits including free lunches for elementary
school children. [nL8N1TM5LX]
    The draft budget sees a public finance gap of 2.1 billion
euros next year while the public debt is expected to fall to
47.3 percent of GDP in 2019, from 48.7 percent this year. The
euro zone average was 86.7 percent last year.
    The plans are based on expected economic growth of 4.5
percent in 2019 -- more than double the European Union and euro
zone average.
    Slovakia is home to three automotive plants and a fourth one
is expected to come online later this year, helping growth and
cementing the country's position as the world's biggest
per-capita car maker.

Board members present at the meeting: Mugur Isărescu, Chairman
of the Board and Governor of the National Bank of Romania;
Florin Georgescu, Vice Chairman of the Board and First Deputy
Governor of the National Bank of Romania; Eugen Nicolăescu,
Board member and Deputy Governor of the National Bank of
Romania; Liviu Voinea, Board member and Deputy Governor of the
National Bank of Romania; Marin Dinu, Board member; Daniel
Dăianu, Board member; Gheorghe Gherghina, Board member; Ágnes
Nagy, Board member; and Virgiliu-Jorj Stoenescu, Board member.

During the meeting, the Board discussed and adopted the monetary
policy decision, based on the data and analyses on current and
future macroeconomic, financial and monetary developments
submitted by the specialised departments, as well as on other
available domestic and external information.

Looking at the recent evolution of inflation, Board members
noted that it had been in line with expectations. The annual
inflation rate had seen a significant downward correction in
July to 4.56 percent from 5.4 percent in the previous month,
reaching 5.06 percent in August, i.e. slightly below the
forecast. The fall versus June had been particularly induced by
administered prices and fuel prices, mainly against the backdrop
of some base effects. The developments in vegetable and fruit
prices had had opposite influences, albeit of a lower magnitude.

It was remarked that core inflation as well had further
contributed to the inflation slowdown, although only marginally,
with the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate remaining
virtually flat at 2.9 percent in July and subsequently declining
to 2.8 percent in August, i.e. slightly below the forecast. The
decline had been supported, that time too, by processed food and
services, more visibly influenced by the dynamics of
international prices of some agri-food items, including the
associated base effects, as well as by the relative appreciation
of the leu against the euro. An opposite effect worth mentioning
had had the dynamics of non-food prices. Some Board members were
of the view that, overall, core inflation was further marked by
the unexpectedly sudden loss of momentum of consumer demand in
2018 Q1, associated with the moderation of the cyclical position
of the economy, likely to exert an inertial influence on the
price-setting behaviour on certain retail trade segments. Unit
labour costs had, however, retained their double-digit annual
dynamics in Q2 or had increased at faster rates, while
short-term inflation expectations had remained elevated.
Moreover, GDP deflator had continued to rise, while the annual
growth rate of industrial producer prices of non-durables on the
domestic market had turned upwards June through July.

Looking at the cyclical position of the economy, Board members
first remarked the strong slowdown in the economy’s rate of
increase versus last year. At the same time, it was noted that
in Q2 the economic growth had seen, however, a slight
re-acceleration, in annual terms, to 4.1 percent from 4.0
percent in Q1, given the step-up in its quarterly dynamics. That
was indicative of a larger-than-expected re-widening of the
excess aggregate demand April through June. Private consumption
had continued to be the main driver of the economic advance,
making an even somewhat higher contribution, as a result of the
unexpected acceleration in its annual dynamics. It had been
closely followed by the change in inventories, whose
contribution to GDP dynamics had reached a 5-year high, whereas
the contribution of gross fixed capital formation had turned
negative again, amid the new contraction in annual terms
reported by that component, after three quarters of growth in a
row. Some Board members warned that the evolution was a matter
of concern, considering the economy’s growth potential over the
medium term. The contribution of net exports to the advance in
GDP had remained negative, yet had diminished somewhat, in the
context of a clearer deceleration in the growth rate of imports
than in that of exports. The current account deficit had seen a
small contraction versus 2017 Q2, on account of the improved
balance on primary income. It was also shown that, on the supply
side, the economic growth had benefited from an almost general
support. The services sector had been further the main engine of
growth, albeit making a somewhat lower contribution, whereas the
industrial sector had had a notable, constant contribution.

Board members observed that the statistical data indicated a
renewed labour market tightening in Q2. The ILO unemployment
rate had posted a new quarterly decline to hit a historical low
of 4.2 percent in May, remaining flat at this level through July
as well, while the job vacancy rate had gone up for the second
consecutive quarter. The number of employees economy-wide had
continued to reach new highs, while its annual dynamics had
stopped trending downwards in July, given the slight
re-acceleration in its growth rate in the private sector, for
the first time since 2017 Q1. Board members concluded that
pressures on wages would be further on the rise in the near
term, given the improvement in employment intentions in 2018 Q4,
shown by surveys, as well as the higher difficulties in
recruiting skilled labour. In that context, mention was made of
the re-acceleration seen in Q2 by the annual growth rate of
average gross nominal wage earnings, as well as of the
double-digit range within which the indicator had remained in
July, amid its slight moderation. At the same time, reference
was made to the pick-up reported for the second straight quarter
by the annual change in unit wage costs in industry, followed,
however, by a marked decline in July.

Turning to discussions on monetary conditions, Board members
showed that key interbank money market rates had seen their
positive spread vis-à-vis the monetary policy rate narrow
gradually after the resumption of repos by the central bank,
while remaining at a high level. Some Board members highlighted
that the spread was relevant from the perspective of judging the
monetary policy stance. Reference was made to the continued
relative stability of the EUR/RON exchange rate over the recent
months, most likely attributable to the considerable
differential of interest rates on the local market versus those
prevailing in Europe and regionally.

It was noted that the robust growth of credit to the private
sector had extended into July and August, at an annual pace of
6.6 percent in each month – only marginally below the Q2 average
and slightly above the Q1 reading. In turn, the dynamics of the
leu-denominated component had stuck to double-digit levels,
while following a somewhat steeper downtrend, primarily on the
back of housing loans and credit to non-financial corporations.
However, the share of the domestic currency component in total
private sector credit had further widened in July, before
sticking to 65.3 percent in August.

As regards future developments, based on the latest data and
analyses, Board members shared the view that the annual
inflation rate would probably decline further in the near run,
in line with the medium-term forecast published in the August
2018 Inflation Report, which anticipated its drop to 3.5 percent
in December 2018 and then to 2.7 percent at end-2019. It was
stated that the significant downward correction in inflation
developments expected for Q4 was mainly ascribable to the base
effects associated with the previous year’s increases in all CPI
exogenous components: administered prices, fuel prices, tobacco
product prices and VFE prices. The disinflationary contribution
of supply-side factors was, however, seen to be more modest than
in the latest medium-term forecast, given the unexpected hike in
the electricity price in August, as well as the relative
increase in oil prices. The latter might, nevertheless, exceed
again expectations over the short time horizon,
higher-than-anticipated rises being also possible in the case of
some administered prices and the prices of some food items,
owing to the African swine fever outbreak, the evolution of some
grain prices on the international market, and to the sudden
worsening of weather conditions in September. Some Board members
cautioned that, were such adverse developments to materialise,
the risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations would become
increasingly relevant.

Examining the likely trend of inflationary pressures from the
cyclical position of the economy, Board members noted that the
new assessments reconfirmed the prospects for a marked
deceleration in the annual economic growth in Q3 – largely on
the back of negative base effects –, followed by a more modest
re-acceleration in 2018 Q4, as quarterly GDP dynamics were
expected to slow visibly versus Q2 and only marginally from the
earlier forecast. It was shown that such an evolution implied a
slightly slower widening of the positive output gap during the
second half of the year than in the August forecast, yet at
somewhat higher values than previously anticipated, as a result
of its reopening above expectations in Q2.

In addition, it was observed that, according to the latest
developments in high-frequency indicators, private consumption
had remained the engine of economic growth in Q3 too, but also a
major determinant of its deceleration. In turn, gross fixed
capital formation may have made a more negative contribution to
GDP dynamics during that period, the same as net exports, given
that the differential between the annual growth rate of exports
of goods and that of imports had become negative again in July,
while the surplus on services had followed a steeper downward
path versus the same year-earlier period. Against that
background, in the first month of Q3, the current account
deficit had widened again at a faster rate in annual terms.
Deficit financing seemed, however, to be adequate in the opinion
of some Board members, who nonetheless cautioned about the
reduction in the share of autonomous financing in 2017.

In light of the mixed developments, Board members deemed that
the uncertainties and risks surrounding the latest medium-term
inflation forecast remained significant. Reference was made to
the relative volatility of consumer confidence, which had
however recently re-embarked on an upward path, as well as to
the likely evolution of households’ real disposable income,
inter alia amid the renewed tightening of labour market
conditions, but also amid the potential developments in fuel and
utility prices. Mention was also made of the lower-than-planned
EU funds absorption and public investment spending, with
unfavourable implications for the dynamics of gross fixed
capital formation and ultimately for the internal and external
equilibria of the economy, as well as of the legislative
initiatives on the banking sector, with a potential adverse
impact on lending to non-financial corporations.

Discussions also touched upon the risks to euro area’s economic
performance induced by trade protectionism and the Brexit
uncertainties, as well as by the situation in Italy and the
global financial market volatility. Reference was implicitly
made to the ECB’s monetary policy stance and to its relevance in
terms of the decisions taken by central banks in the region. The
recent financial turmoil in some emerging economies was also
mentioned, while its spillover effects were deemed as modest and
confined to the vulnerable economies in terms of macroeconomic
fundamentals. Against that background, Board members underlined
again the need for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix, to avoid
the overburdening of monetary policy, with undesired effects in
the economy. Moreover, most Board members reiterated the
importance of an adequate dosage and pace of adjustment of the
monetary policy stance, from the perspective of anchoring
inflation expectations and maintaining the annual inflation rate
on the trajectory shown by the NBR’s latest medium-term
forecast, while safeguarding financial stability.

Under the circumstances, the NBR Board unanimously decided to
keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent, the
deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent and the lending (Lombard)
facility rate at 3.50 percent. In addition, the NBR Board
unanimously decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum
reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign
currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions.

unionist party that props up Prime Minister Theresa May's
government, could vote against this month's budget if May
breaches its red lines over Brexit at an EU summit, a BBC
reporter said in a tweet. 
    Votes on the budget have traditionally been seen as votes in
the confidence of a government. 
    May needs the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to vote in
favour of her government's budget on Oct. 29 but the DUP will do
so only if May does not betray its Brexit red lines at next

quoting DUP sources. 
    May has 315 lawmakers and governs with a slender working

    BREXIT DIVIDENDS (AHEM..) (1223 GMT) 
    As hopes of a Brexit deal seem to be on the rise, now is perhaps a good time to have another
look at how the divorce has been treating British equities so far. 
    The chart below shows that when measured in dollars rather than in a weakened pound, the
impact of the EU/UK divorce appears to have been quite negative so far. 
    But with both the EU and Britain signalling progress in recent days, fears about a damaging
no-deal Brexit might actually have been overplayed, who knows?

    SIGNS OF STRAIN AS BREXIT LOOMS OVER LONDON PROPERTY MARKET (1111 GMT)
    The latest wave of optimism on EU divorce talks will undoubtedly reassure those heavily
invested in UK real estate, arguably a no-deal proxy.    
    House sellers are cutting their prices in London and properties are staying on the market
for longer, UBS finds - a negative trend for property companies and housebuilders exposed to the
capital likely to see financial services jobs and EU nationals move away due to Brexit.
    In their analysis using web scrapes of residential property listings, UBS analysts find
reductions have risen to 37 percent of all listings from less than 20 percent in early 2016. The
level of discount in vendors' asking prices has widened to 2.4 percent, and the number of days
on the market has risen to 125 (see below).
    UBS also notes a clear trend with more expensive properties taking longer to sell, with the
widest discounts, calling Kensington & Chelsea ""an extreme case"". 
    The real estate slide may, however, be confined to London rather than spreading through the
country.
    ""In past cycles, a London downturn has pre-empted a wider loss of momentum and decline in
consumer confidence,"" analysts at the Swiss bank write. ""The BoE thinks this time may be
different, as the capital is more exposed than the national market to stamp duty changes and is
more likely to be impacted by the departure of EU nationals.""
    Indeed there's a further indication today of how Brexit is likely to sap demand from the
London property market: Britain's financial services minister says he expects 5,000 financial
services jobs to leave by Brexit Day [nL8N1WQ2F2]

    FOUR REASONS TO SELL LUXURY STOCKS (1003 GMT)
    Luxury is ""so last year"" - that's what Morgan Stanley analysts are saying, in a nutshell, in
a note which is partly responsible for the drop in stocks like LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler,
and Ferragamo today. 
    The selloff in luxury has been building over the past few weeks, and here are MS' four key
reasons to sell the sector. They say it's not too late to do so despite the recent falls:
    1. Luxury is vulnerable to underperformance of growth versus value - 92% of the sector is in
Europe's growth index
    2. Valuations remain elevated despite falling recently (see chart below), and investors are
still
heavily positioned in luxury
    3. Earnings momentum is slowing - analysts have begun downgrading earnings and sales
estimates
    4. China's consumer confidence may have peaked - Morgan Stanley's China economist expects
Chinese
consumption figures for the second half to slow further

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE DIPS, LUXURY UNDER PRESSURE (0730 GMT)
    European equity benchmarks have opened without clear direction with the STOXX 600 trading
marginally down but above the six-month lows hit yesterday. 
    In the spotlight are luxury stocks with LVMH <LVMH.PA> falling 5 percent despite a 10
percent sales growth in the third quarter. Other luxury stocks were also down sharply.
    Traders are linking the drop to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley, which has downgraded
the sector to underweight, saying it prefers value stocks over growth.
    ""We believe the recent outperformance of value vs growth has further to go and hence
downgrade the EU Luxury Goods sector to Underweight from a top down perspective,"" they say.
    Here's your snapshot with Europe's country benchmarks.

    NO MOOD SWING ON OUR RADAR (0651 GMT)

another lacklustre start. There does not seem to be enough strong corporate headlines out there
to push the market either way or force a mood swing.

    Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved a deal on Wednesday between
British energy suppliers SSE and Npower to merge their retail units.
    In the competitive food delivery sector, Takeaway.com announced third-quarter sales grew by
40 percent in the German market, where it is locked in an expensive fight for dominance with
Delivery Hero. 
    Just as fears the trade war is starting to take its toll on luxury goods, LVMH said its
fashion and handbags business boosted third-quarter sales growth. Trade war challenged European
car makers now will have to comply with the European Union’s will to seek a 35 percent cut in
car emissions by 2030.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES: LACKLUSTRE RED (0614 GMT) 
    European futures have opened to an overall pale red picture even if this probably qualifies
as a lacklustre start.  
    ""Uncertainty is prevailing in the financial markets, we are seeing more investors opting to
wait and see how risks surrounding rising US treasury yields, global growth and China play out"",
wrote Jasper Lawler of LDC in a morning note. 
    He added that while markets have been complacent for a while, ""we are starting to see an
acknowledgement of these risks which is keeping traders on the side-lines"".

    MORNING CALL: NO REASON FOR EUROPE TO RISE (0525 GMT)
    Financial spreadbetters don't seem to have any reason to bet on a rise of European stock
markets after little movement on Wall Street and in Asia. 
    World stocks are still in touching distance of eight-week lows as worries about global
economic growth continue to dampen the mood.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Danish and Estonian financial
crime agencies have not asked Russia to help investigate a
massive money laundering scandal at Danske Bank involving
Russian and other account holders, Russia's financial monitoring
service told Reuters on Wednesday.
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
transactions processed by Denmark's biggest bank via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank
said last month it thinks are suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    ""As of today, we have not received any official request from
Estonian or Danish law enforcement agencies or financial
intelligence units (for) assistance within the existing
international agreements and obligations,"" Rosfinmonitoring said
in an email reply to questions from Reuters.
    Some 23 percent of the incoming funds in the Estonian
non-resident portfolio, the centre of the scandal, came from
Russia, Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in its report last month.
    ""It is really criticisable that the Danish authorities did
not reach out to the Russians. It would have been very relevant
to ask them, to find out: where does the money come from,"" Jakob
Dedenroth Bernhoft, a Copenhagen-based expert on anti money
laundering, told Reuters.
    The case has, along with one involving Dutch financial group
ING <INGA.AS>, prompted European authorities to call for
stricter regulation of the financial sector. [nL8N1VQ0IK]
    Andrea Enria, head of the European Union's banking watchdog,
said on Monday it had launched an inquiry into the Danish
financial regulator's handling of the Danske case. [nL8N1WO4B0]
    Rosfinmonitoring is unconditionally ready to assist ""in
counteracting laundering of the proceeds of crimes, provided we
receive such requests via the official channels,"" the watchdog
said.
    It also said Russian authorities as far back as 2007
notified Estonian authorities about Danske Bank's ""improper
behaviour and its involvement in suspicious transit operations"".
    Danske's report concluded the bank had failed to take proper
action in 2007 when it was criticised by Estonia's regulator.
[nL8N1W51FB]
    Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Wednesday the
country's Financial Services Authority (FSA) had put too much
trust in information provided by Danske.
    ""I think it's a problem that the FSA to a high degree is
supervising the banks by asking them, and then get answers
back,"" Jarlov said at an open hearing in the Danish parliament's
business committee.
    ""I've asked the FSA how we can out of that situation, so
that we will not, in another case, get into the same situation.
    The FSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
    Jarlov also said Danish authorities were in contact with
counterparts in the United States regarding Danske. [nL8N1WQ3AS]
    Danske said last week it had ""received requests for
information from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in
connection with a criminal investigation relating to the bank's
Estonian branch"". [nL8N1WK1GP]

 (Adds background, detail, updates sector shares)
    By Johannes Hellstrom and John Miller
    STOCKHOLM/ZURICH, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Swiss vacuum valve
maker VAT Group <VACN.S> sent a shiver through the semiconductor
industry on Wednesday when it said it was cutting working hours
at one of its factories due to a softening of demand from the
chip equipment makers it supplies.
    Shares of chipmakers and suppliers to the industry racked up
big losses after VAT said about 400 employees at its site in
Haag, northwestern Switzerland, would work shorter hours from
Oct. 15 until at least the end of the year.
    VAT shares were down 10 percent by 1140 GMT, while Sweden's
Atlas Copco <ATCOa.ST> and Germany's Pfeiffer Vacuum <PV.DE>,
which both sell vacuum pumps to semiconductor fabrication
plants, were down 4.7 percent and 6.3 percent respectively.
    Chipmakers such as Infineon Technologies <IFXGn.DE>,
STMicroelectronics <STM.MI> and AMS <AMS.S>, also saw shares
drop sharply.
    After years of booming demand growth, semiconductor makers
are scaling back activity or delaying projects, following a
period of large-scale investment.
    Weak demand, overcapacity and a trade conflict between the
United States and China has dampened investment, as electronics
companies wait out uncertainty, analysts say.
    The sector has lost steam this year as a weaker smartphone
market and worries over lower chip prices and capital spending
weighed on shares. 
    German chip factory builder Exyte shelved plans this month
to float on the Frankfurt stock exchange, while Applied
Materials <AMAT.O>, a major VAT customer, issued a weak forecast
in August, foreshadowing the end of the two-year chip boom.
[nL4N1V75FC]
    VAT Group, whose main production sites are in Switzerland,
Romania and Malaysia, had flagged slower demand earlier this
year, saying in August that second-quarter orders had fallen 13
percent.
    
    OVERALL OUTLOOK HEALTHY
    The company said on Wednesday it expected continued growth
in its major markets ""but at a more moderate pace"", mainly
reflecting the postponement of several large expansions of
semiconductor and display factories. 
    VAT said its overall outlook remained healthy, however.
    Zuercher Kantonalbank said trade conflicts, including
between the United States and China, where VAT is expanding its
presence, also weighed. 
    ""A quick resolution of trade conflicts could take the brakes
off certain investment projects,"" analyst Alexander Koller wrote
in a note to investors. 
    A VAT spokesman said that trade tensions may be playing a
""small"" role in investment decisions, but said the main culprit 
behind the slowdown was a ""small production overcapacity""
following a recent wave of investment in manufacturing.
    Prices for NAND chips, used for longer-term data storage,
have already dropped due to oversupply, while prices for DRAM,
chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks, are expected
to follow suit. 
    Morgan Stanley said in a note on Tuesday it expected recent
weakness in NAND markets to extend to DRAM in the fourth
quarter, suggesting capital spending declines in memory in 2019,
due to oversupply.
    Goldman Sachs lowered its outlook for the semiconductor
capital equipment sector in September, saying oversupply would
limit spending. [nL3N1VY61C]
    Other sector suppliers such as Sweden's Atlas Copco in July
forecast lower third-quarter equipment demand from the
semiconductor industry, citing a spending pause at some of its
biggest clients. [nL5N1UT2CE]
    Atlas Copco's client list include Intel <INTC.O>, Samsung, 
TSMC <2330.TW>, as well as Dutch group ASML <ASML.AS>. 
    Elsewhere in the sector, Global Foundries'
multi-billion-dollar 'fab' in Dresden, a major hub for Germany’s
semiconductor industry, has reduced working hours and is seeking
to reduce staff through voluntary redundancy, a source familiar
with the matter said recently.

    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The DUP, the Northern Irish
unionist party that props up Theresa May's government, could
vote against this month's UK budget if the prime minister
breaches the party's red lines over Brexit at an EU summit, the
BBC and Sky News said on Wednesday.
    May relies on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party
on major votes after she lost her governing Conservative Party's
majority at an election last year. Budget votes have
traditionally been seen as votes of confidence in a government.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the European
Union, May's negotiations with the bloc are under scrutiny from
all sides of the Brexit debate, with the DUP concerned that any
deal may effectively split Northern Ireland from the mainland.
    On Tuesday, Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, warned
the government not to repeat ""that mistake"" from December - when
the party almost pulled the rug out from an interim accord with
the EU by scuppering a proposal on regulatory alignment between
the bloc and the province. [nL8N1WP5Q6]
    DUP leader Arlene Foster has said there is ""only one red
line"" in the Brexit talks, ruling out her party's support for
any arrangement ""which could give rise to either customs or
regulatory barriers within the UK internal market"". [nL8N1WP5Q6]
    The BBC and Sky News, without citing sources, reported that
the DUP could vote against the budget on Oct. 29 if a deal meant
new barriers between the British province and the rest of the
United Kingdom.
    The DUP did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.
    May and her Brexit minister Dominic Raab have repeatedly
said Britain cannot accept any deal that fails to protect the
integrity of Britain.

    ""WITHOUT CONVICTIONS AND WITH LOTS OF DOUBT"" (1343 GMT)
    That quote comes from a SocGen note which looks into the outlook for equity volatility in
Q4. 
    It mirrors quite well the angst which has been palpable in morning notes these last few days
after a series of disappointing sessions.
    World equities are very close to mid-August lows and there just doesn't seem to be much
belief in a rebound.
    So what better time, ask SocGen analysts, for investors to review how their portfolios are
hedged, now that volatility may well make a comeback. 
    A combo of a fading tax boost, corporate revenues slowing down, the trade war starting to
hurt and tighter monetary policy could lay the ground for some action in the VIX in 2019, they
reckon. 
    ""We believe that the current low-volatility environment provides an opportunity to prepare
for a rise in risk perception and correction of large imbalances in 2H19,"" SocGen argues. 
    Of course it's always difficult to measure a rise in volatility due to the huge breadth of
levels over the past ten years. 
    As you can see from the chart below, the VIX is still very low if compared to the last
decade but seriously high in  context of the last three months:

    BREXIT DIVIDENDS (AHEM..) (1223 GMT) 
    As hopes of a Brexit deal seem to be on the rise, now is perhaps a good time to have another
look at how the divorce has been treating British equities so far. 
    The chart below shows that when measured in dollars rather than in a weakened pound, the
impact of the EU/UK divorce appears to have been quite negative so far. 
    But with both the EU and Britain signalling progress in recent days, fears about a damaging
no-deal Brexit might actually have been overplayed, who knows?

    SIGNS OF STRAIN AS BREXIT LOOMS OVER LONDON PROPERTY MARKET (1111 GMT)
    The latest wave of optimism on EU divorce talks will undoubtedly reassure those heavily
invested in UK real estate, arguably a no-deal proxy.    
    House sellers are cutting their prices in London and properties are staying on the market
for longer, UBS finds - a negative trend for property companies and housebuilders exposed to the
capital likely to see financial services jobs and EU nationals move away due to Brexit.
    In their analysis using web scrapes of residential property listings, UBS analysts find
reductions have risen to 37 percent of all listings from less than 20 percent in early 2016. The
level of discount in vendors' asking prices has widened to 2.4 percent, and the number of days
on the market has risen to 125 (see below).
    UBS also notes a clear trend with more expensive properties taking longer to sell, with the
widest discounts, calling Kensington & Chelsea ""an extreme case"". 
    The real estate slide may, however, be confined to London rather than spreading through the
country.
    ""In past cycles, a London downturn has pre-empted a wider loss of momentum and decline in
consumer confidence,"" analysts at the Swiss bank write. ""The BoE thinks this time may be
different, as the capital is more exposed than the national market to stamp duty changes and is
more likely to be impacted by the departure of EU nationals.""
    Indeed there's a further indication today of how Brexit is likely to sap demand from the
London property market: Britain's financial services minister says he expects 5,000 financial
services jobs to leave by Brexit Day [nL8N1WQ2F2]

    FOUR REASONS TO SELL LUXURY STOCKS (1003 GMT)
    Luxury is ""so last year"" - that's what Morgan Stanley analysts are saying, in a nutshell, in
a note which is partly responsible for the drop in stocks like LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler,
and Ferragamo today. 
    The selloff in luxury has been building over the past few weeks, and here are MS' four key
reasons to sell the sector. They say it's not too late to do so despite the recent falls:
    1. Luxury is vulnerable to underperformance of growth versus value - 92% of the sector is in
Europe's growth index
    2. Valuations remain elevated despite falling recently (see chart below), and investors are
still
heavily positioned in luxury
    3. Earnings momentum is slowing - analysts have begun downgrading earnings and sales
estimates
    4. China's consumer confidence may have peaked - Morgan Stanley's China economist expects
Chinese
consumption figures for the second half to slow further

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE DIPS, LUXURY UNDER PRESSURE (0730 GMT)
    European equity benchmarks have opened without clear direction with the STOXX 600 trading
marginally down but above the six-month lows hit yesterday. 
    In the spotlight are luxury stocks with LVMH <LVMH.PA> falling 5 percent despite a 10
percent sales growth in the third quarter. Other luxury stocks were also down sharply.
    Traders are linking the drop to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley, which has downgraded
the sector to underweight, saying it prefers value stocks over growth.
    ""We believe the recent outperformance of value vs growth has further to go and hence
downgrade the EU Luxury Goods sector to Underweight from a top down perspective,"" they say.
    Here's your snapshot with Europe's country benchmarks.

    European futures have opened to an overall pale red picture even if this probably qualifies
as a lacklustre start.  
    ""Uncertainty is prevailing in the financial markets, we are seeing more investors opting to
wait and see how risks surrounding rising US treasury yields, global growth and China play out"",
wrote Jasper Lawler of LDC in a morning note. 
    He added that while markets have been complacent for a while, ""we are starting to see an
acknowledgement of these risks which is keeping traders on the side-lines"".

    MORNING CALL: NO REASON FOR EUROPE TO RISE (0525 GMT)
    Financial spreadbetters don't seem to have any reason to bet on a rise of European stock
markets after little movement on Wall Street and in Asia. 
    World stocks are still in touching distance of eight-week lows as worries about global
economic growth continue to dampen the mood. 
    London's FTSE is expected to open 12 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 23 points and Paris'
CAC to dip 3 points.

    * Fiscal compliance should be assessed only on primary
expenditure
    * Proposal comes as Italy, Commission spar on next year's
budget

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Union should
change its budget rules to make them more effective in bringing
down public debts, EU fiscal advisers said in a report on
Wednesday, urging the bloc to scrap deficit targets for
countries where debt is falling.
    The publication of the report coincides with a row between
Italy and Brussels over the country's 2019 budget, in which the
eurosceptic Italian government plans to flout EU fiscal rules to
fulfil electoral promises of government largesse.
    The European Fiscal Board, which advises on the EU's
supervision of member states' budgetary plans, said the existing
budget rules are too complex and have largely failed to improve
the long-term sustainability of public finances in several EU
states.
    The report highlighted that improvements in EU countries'
fiscal positions in past years largely came from higher growth.
It also said that an opportunity to reduce high debt levels
faster was missed.
    The Fiscal Board's report suggested getting rid of existing
deficit targets, which require structural adjustments and a
nominal ceiling of 3 percent of the gross domestic product.
Instead, the Commission should focus exclusively on reducing the
debt, the report said.
    ""The debt-to-GDP ratio should be the anchor of the new
simplified fiscal framework. This choice ensures that long-term
debt sustainability in the member states remains the ultimate
objective of the rules,"" the report said.
    Under the proposal, countries which maintain their primary
expenditure below a set ceiling over a three-year period - and
therefore are set to lower their debt - could be considered in
line with EU rules even if they run excess deficits. 
    Advisers also proposed scrapping structural deficit targets
as a way of assessing fiscal compliance.
    The proposal could be welcomed in countries like Italy which
call for larger deficits. The Commission last week warned Italy
that its budgetary plans for next year were at risk of breaching
the structural deficit requirement.
    But even under the Fiscal Board's proposals, Italy would be
likely to be non-compliant as the country's debt is not on a
credible downward path.
    The report said debt should remain below 60 percent of GDP,
in line with current requirements, but proposed a longer
adjustment period of 15 years to reach the target.
    Italy has a debt above 130 percent of GDP. The Italian
government says its expansionary budget will reduce the debt by
increasing growth, but experts agree the expected output is
over-optimistic.
    Advisers also recommended making sanctions for offenders
more gradual and effective as existing penalties have never been
applied.

    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The DUP, the Northern Irish
unionist party that props up Theresa May's government, could
vote against this month's UK budget if the prime minister
breaches the party's red lines over Brexit at an EU summit, the
BBC and Sky News said on Wednesday.
    May relies on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party
on major votes after she lost her governing Conservative Party's
majority at an election last year. Budget votes have
traditionally been seen as votes of confidence in a government.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the European
Union, May's negotiations with the bloc are under scrutiny from
all sides of the Brexit debate, with the DUP concerned that any
deal may effectively split Northern Ireland from the mainland.
    On Tuesday, Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, warned
the government not to repeat ""that mistake"" from December - when
the party almost pulled the rug out from an interim accord with
the EU by scuppering a proposal on regulatory alignment between
the bloc and the province. [nL8N1WP5Q6]
    DUP leader Arlene Foster has said there is ""only one red
line"" in the Brexit talks, ruling out her party's support for
any arrangement ""which could give rise to either customs or
regulatory barriers within the UK internal market"". [nL8N1WP5Q6]
    The BBC and Sky, without citing sources, reported that the
DUP could vote against the budget on Oct. 29 if a deal meant new
barriers between the British province and the rest of the United
Kingdom.
    A DUP source said it was ""unacceptable that we would be
treated differently to the rest of the UK ... We will not be
bounced into anything.""
    May and her Brexit minister Dominic Raab have repeatedly
said Britain cannot accept any deal that fails to protect the
integrity of Britain.

Andrea Nahles questioned her party's future in the government
after a rocky six months during which the coalition has twice
come close to collapse.
    In an interview with Die Zeit newspaper, Nahles blamed
divisions within the two conservative parties in Chancellor
Angela Merkel's grand coalition, which relies on the centre-left
Social Democrats (SPD) to govern.
    ""If the internal spat among the conservatives continues to
overshadow everything, there obviously comes a point at which
good substantive work no longer makes any sense,"" Nahles said in
the interview, extracts of which Die Zeit released before
publication on Thursday. 
    The coalition - made up of Merkel's Christian Democrats
(CDU), their Bavarian CSU allies and the SPD - had a row last
month over the fate of the security service chief. That followed
a dispute between the CDU and CSU in the summer over
immigration. They ultimately found compromises on both issues.
    ""Ever since this government has taken up work or actually
ever since the coalition negotiations started, the dispute among
conservatives over what direction to take has been a huge burden
for this coalition,"" Nahles said. 
    The SPD was reluctant to form another grand coalition with
the conservatives after a national election in September 2017
but initial talks between the conservatives and two smaller
parties failed, leaving no other viable government.
    The government took office only in March, nearly six months
after the election, and the coalition deal includes a clause
that envisages a review of its progress after two years. This is
widely seen as giving the SPD an exit should it want one. 
    Nahles also criticised Merkel, saying the chancellor had not
yet been able to steer the coalition into calmer waters.
    Differences over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars
with excessive emissions have also strained the government,
though the parties agreed last week to ask carmakers to offer
owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes. [nL8N1WI1K1]

    INVESTORS' MAIN OBSESSIONS, AND WHERE THEY COULD BE WRONG (1437 GMT)
    After a series of meetings Credit Suisse's global equity strategists Andrew Garthwaite and
team summarise what clients are obsessing over the most: 
    * Growth versus Value - clients have been selling growth although they noted we haven't seen
the
extremes of previous growth bubbles (see below). CS remains overweight US growth but benchmark
European growth
    * DM versus EM - clients see deep value in EM equities but see few catalysts with the
dollar, US
rates, oil and China all heading in the wrong direction
    * US versus non-US - CS' survey finds the second-highest proportion of clients who believe
the US
will be the best-performing region over the next 3 months. ""Clients see little reason to add to
continental Europe and there are clear signs of US investor capitulation on the region""

    They think investors could be wrong on the following fronts: 
    * Looking to buy US bonds. Garthwaite and team point out neither the MOVE index of bond
volatility
nor the NY Fed term premium imply we're at a peak in US yields
    * Trade. Most clients don't expect a deal ahead of mid-terms - but CS says ""recent trade
deals
have been better than expected""
    * Pessimism on the cycle. Clients are more pessimistic than at any point in the past 5
years, yet
valuations of cyclicals don't reflect this

    Then there were several areas where clients asked very few questions - which Garthwaite et
al think could indicate complacency. 
    These blind spots included Japan, technology, market direction, quantitative tightening, and
how Trump's policies could change after the mid-terms.

    ""WITHOUT CONVICTIONS AND WITH LOTS OF DOUBT"" (1343 GMT)
    That quote comes from a SocGen note which looks into the outlook for equity volatility in
Q4. 
    It mirrors quite well the angst which has been palpable in morning notes these last few days
after a series of disappointing sessions.
    World equities are very close to mid-August lows and there just doesn't seem to be much
belief in a rebound.
    So what better time, ask SocGen analysts, for investors to review how their portfolios are
hedged, now that volatility may well make a comeback. 
    A combo of a fading tax boost, corporate revenues slowing down, the trade war starting to
hurt and tighter monetary policy could lay the ground for some action in the VIX in 2019, they
reckon. 
    ""We believe that the current low-volatility environment provides an opportunity to prepare
for a rise in risk perception and correction of large imbalances in 2H19,"" SocGen argues. 
    Of course it's always difficult to measure a rise in volatility due to the huge breadth of
levels over the past ten years. 
    As you can see from the chart below, the VIX is still very low if compared to the last
decade but seriously high in  context of the last three months:

    BREXIT DIVIDENDS (AHEM..) (1223 GMT) 
    As hopes of a Brexit deal seem to be on the rise, now is perhaps a good time to have another
look at how the divorce has been treating British equities so far. 
    The chart below shows that when measured in dollars rather than in a weakened pound, the
impact of the EU/UK divorce appears to have been quite negative so far. 
    But with both the EU and Britain signalling progress in recent days, fears about a damaging
no-deal Brexit might actually have been overplayed, who knows?

    SIGNS OF STRAIN AS BREXIT LOOMS OVER LONDON PROPERTY MARKET (1111 GMT)
    The latest wave of optimism on EU divorce talks will undoubtedly reassure those heavily
invested in UK real estate, arguably a no-deal proxy.    
    House sellers are cutting their prices in London and properties are staying on the market
for longer, UBS finds - a negative trend for property companies and housebuilders exposed to the
capital likely to see financial services jobs and EU nationals move away due to Brexit.
    In their analysis using web scrapes of residential property listings, UBS analysts find
reductions have risen to 37 percent of all listings from less than 20 percent in early 2016. The
level of discount in vendors' asking prices has widened to 2.4 percent, and the number of days
on the market has risen to 125 (see below).
    UBS also notes a clear trend with more expensive properties taking longer to sell, with the
widest discounts, calling Kensington & Chelsea ""an extreme case"". 
    The real estate slide may, however, be confined to London rather than spreading through the
country.
    ""In past cycles, a London downturn has pre-empted a wider loss of momentum and decline in
consumer confidence,"" analysts at the Swiss bank write. ""The BoE thinks this time may be
different, as the capital is more exposed than the national market to stamp duty changes and is
more likely to be impacted by the departure of EU nationals.""
    Indeed there's a further indication today of how Brexit is likely to sap demand from the
London property market: Britain's financial services minister says he expects 5,000 financial
services jobs to leave by Brexit Day [nL8N1WQ2F2]

    FOUR REASONS TO SELL LUXURY STOCKS (1003 GMT)
    Luxury is ""so last year"" - that's what Morgan Stanley analysts are saying, in a nutshell, in
a note which is partly responsible for the drop in stocks like LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler,
and Ferragamo today. 
    The selloff in luxury has been building over the past few weeks, and here are MS' four key
reasons to sell the sector. They say it's not too late to do so despite the recent falls:
    1. Luxury is vulnerable to underperformance of growth versus value - 92% of the sector is in
Europe's growth index
    2. Valuations remain elevated despite falling recently (see chart below), and investors are
still
heavily positioned in luxury
    3. Earnings momentum is slowing - analysts have begun downgrading earnings and sales
estimates
    4. China's consumer confidence may have peaked - Morgan Stanley's China economist expects
Chinese
consumption figures for the second half to slow further

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE DIPS, LUXURY UNDER PRESSURE (0730 GMT)
    European equity benchmarks have opened without clear direction with the STOXX 600 trading
marginally down but above the six-month lows hit yesterday. 
    In the spotlight are luxury stocks with LVMH <LVMH.PA> falling 5 percent despite a 10
percent sales growth in the third quarter. Other luxury stocks were also down sharply.
    Traders are linking the drop to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley, which has downgraded
the sector to underweight, saying it prefers value stocks over growth.
    ""We believe the recent outperformance of value vs growth has further to go and hence
downgrade the EU Luxury Goods sector to Underweight from a top down perspective,"" they say.
    Here's your snapshot with Europe's country benchmarks.

    NO MOOD SWING ON OUR RADAR (0651 GMT) 
    There's still a slightly negative trend for the futures and it looks like we are set for
another lacklustre start. There does not seem to be enough strong corporate headlines out there
to push the market either way or force a mood swing.
    Interesting to see will be whether European banking supervisors stepping up their monitoring
of liquidity levels at Italian banks will add to stress in Milan. [nL8N1WQ0XV]
    Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved a deal on Wednesday between
British energy suppliers SSE and Npower to merge their retail units.
    In the competitive food delivery sector, Takeaway.com announced third-quarter sales grew by
40 percent in the German market, where it is locked in an expensive fight for dominance with
Delivery Hero. 
    Just as fears the trade war is starting to take its toll on luxury goods, LVMH said its
fashion and handbags business boosted third-quarter sales growth. Trade war challenged European
car makers now will have to comply with the European Union’s will to seek a 35 percent cut in

    By Richard Leong
    NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro and sterling rose on
Wednesday, underpinned by optimism for a Brexit deal, while the
dollar lost ground against a basket of currencies even as U.S.
bond yields hovered at multiyear peaks.
    The common currency's gains were limited by worries about
the sustainability of Italy's public finances, though Italian
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria reiterated on Wednesday that the
government would do everything in its power to regain the
confidence of financial markets. [nR1N1VZ01R] [nL8N1WQ1DK]
    ""There is more optimism that they will find some agreement
between Britain and (the) European Union before Brexit,"" said
Steve Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard
Chartered Bank in New York.
    This week, Brexit negotiators have hinted progress toward
terms for Britain to leave the economic bloc in March, which
gave investors hope for an orderly departure. Still, caution
persists due to scant details. [nL8N1WQ1GM]
    On Wednesday, EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said
the two parties have agreed on much of the withdrawal agreement
ahead of a summit of all the bloc's 28 national leaders next
week. [nB5N1U6017]
    The pound reached a two-week high at $1.3210 Wednesday and
held a gain of 0.46 percent on the day. It hit its strongest
level against the euro since June 15 at 87.23 pence.
    The euro rose 0.34 percent to $1.15315 and 0.17 percent to 
130.035 yen.
    The bounce in the two currencies offset an increase in U.S.
Treasury yields, putting pressure on the dollar.
    Benchmark 10-year yield <US10YT=RR> retreated from a
seven-year high of 3.261 percent set on Tuesday, even as
investors reduced their bond holdings in advance of $36 billion
3-year and $23 billion 10-year note auctions later Wednesday.
    U.S. yields have increased on rising government debt supply
and worries about higher inflation, which may push the Federal
Reserve to raise short-term rates more quickly. 
    The ICE dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback
against six major currencies, fell 0.24 percent on the day to
95.437. It hit a seven-week high on Tuesday at 96.155.
    Among other major currencies, the Norwegian crown gained
0.83 percent against the dollar <NOK=> to 8.1970 crowns, and
rose 0.51 percent versus the euro to 9.4522 crowns, after
Norway's inflation rate rose more than expected in September
[nEONIA80SS].

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 10: Fitch Ratings has downgraded Banca 
Carige's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'CCC+' from 'B-' and the 
bank's Viability Rating (VR) to 'ccc+' from 'b-'. The ratings have been placed 
on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). A full list of rating actions is at the end of 
this rating action commentary.

The downgrade reflects Fitch's view that the bank's failure is a real 
possibility because we believe that it will be challenging for the bank to 
strengthen its capital, which could ultimately lead to regulatory intervention. 
The bank currently does not meet its Pillar 2 requirement for total capital and 
plans to issue Tier 2 debt to reach it, which is likely to be difficult in the 
changed market conditions for Italian banks. Carige's largest shareholder has 
stated it would support the bank but has not made a firm commitment to subscribe 
to the entire EUR200 million of Tier 2 debt the bank plans to issue.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT

Carige's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the risk to the bank's viability has 
increased because the bank does not meet its Pillar 2 total capital requirement. 
Carige has failed to issue Tier 2 debt over the course of this year, while 
market conditions for Italian banks have weakened in recent months.

The ratings also reflect the latest change of management. Since early 2016, the 
bank's CEO has been replaced twice and the bank is in the process of approving a 
third restructuring plan. In our view, this adds uncertainty to the direction of 
its future strategy as the bank may require more time to implement its 
turnaround, which needs to meet the supervisory authorities' expectations.   

The VR and IDRs continue to reflect the weak standalone profile of Carige and 
its highly vulnerable prospects for ongoing viability given its still high 
levels of impaired loans and weak medium-term profitability prospects. In our 
view, Carige's corporate governance gives rise to significant risks to 
creditors. This view is underpinned by the high turnover of senior management 
and highly variable strategic targets in recent years. 

Carige's stock of gross impaired loans at end-1H18 stood at over EUR4.7 billion 
and the bank's gross impaired loans ratio was around 27% when excluding bonds 
accounted at amortised cost. This is much higher than domestic and international 
averages despite  significant reductions by the bank over the past 12 months. 

Previous management had planned to de-risk the bank's balance sheet further by 
end-2018, primarily through the sale of around EUR400 million unlikely-to-pay 
exposures (UtPs) and the securitisation of up to EUR1 billion doubtful loans. 
While we expect the UtP deconsolidation to take place before end-2018, it is 
possible that the doubtful loans securitisation may be more difficult given the 
changed market conditions in Italy. 

Net impaired loans weigh on capital significantly, with IFRS 9 Stage 3 
unreserved impaired loans still representing nearly 150% of Fitch Core Capital 
according to our estimate at end-1H18.

The CET1 ratio of Carige was 11.9% at end-1H18, significantly above its Pillar 2 
requirement of 9.625% and higher than its 11.175% Pillar 2 guidance. However, 
the Total Capital Ratio (TCR) of 12.0% was 120bp below the bank's Pillar 2 
requirement of 13.125% and will remain below requirements even after all planned 
disposals and de-risking initiatives are completed by year-end, unless the bank 
manages to issue subordinated debt or increase capital by other means. 

During 2018 the bank has attempted unsuccessfully to issue Tier 2 subordinated 
debt at least twice and was therefore unable to rebuild subordinated debt 
buffers that could protect senior creditors. We view Carige's access to the 
capital market as highly uncertain. The bank will have to present an updated 
capital conservation plan to the supervisory authorities by end-November 2018 
that would allow it to restore capitalisation above TCR Pillar 2 requirements by 
year-end. 

Our assessment of Carige's funding continues to reflect a franchise that remains 
vulnerable to creditor sentiment, which could lead to deposit outflows, but also 
significant refinancing risk. 

The RWN reflects Fitch's view that failure to complete the capital strengthening 
by end-2018 would increase the risk of regulatory intervention, and hence of 
losses being imposed on senior creditors, for example in a liquidation or a 
resolution. This would lead to a downgrade of the Long-Term IDR and senior debt 
ratings.

Carige's senior unsecured bonds are rated in line with the bank's IDRs. The 
Recovery Rating of '4' (RR4) reflects Fitch's expectation of average recovery 
prospects in the event of a default of these instruments.

The Short-Term IDR has been downgraded to 'C' from 'B' because it is mapped from 
the Long-Term IDR.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR 

The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view that although 
external support is possible it cannot be relied upon. Senior creditors cannot 
expect to receive full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event 
that the bank becomes non-viable. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution 
Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism for eurozone banks provide a 
framework for the resolution of banks that requires senior creditors to 
participate in losses, if necessary, instead of a bank receiving sovereign 
support.

SUBORDINATED DEBT

The planned subordinated issue is rated 'CCC-(EXP)', which is two notches below 
Carige's 'ccc+' VR to reflect our expectations of poor recovery prospects for 
the notes in case of a non-viability event. We believe that should the bank 
fail, Carige is at risk of being placed into outright liquidation and that an 
intermediary solution prior to resolution (such as a second debt restructuring 
with a distressed debt exchange (DDE) similar to the one completed in late 2017 
or other solution) is less likely.

Our view is supported by the bank's currently thin layers of junior non-equity 
capital (less than 1% of risk-weighted assets ahead of this issue) relative to 
the risks faced, specifically the still high non-performing loan levels. The 
prospects of poor recoveries for subordinated bondholders in a resolution 
scenario are reflected in the 'RR6' Recovery Rating on the notes.

We do not notch the notes for non-performance risk as no coupon flexibility is 
included in their terms.

The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to 
the information already received.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT

Carige's ratings would probably be downgraded if the bank does not manage to 
meet its Pillar 2 total capital requirement by end-2018, for which it will 
likely have to raise Tier 2 debt. The ratings could also be downgraded if 
deposit outflows increase or if liquidity or funding tightens for other reasons. 
The ratings could also be downgraded if the bank's future strategy gives rise to 
increased execution risk, which ultimately could result in heightened risk of 
regulatory action being taken and losses imposed on senior creditors. 

Since the bank already undertook a subordinated debt-restructuring and raised 
capital in late 2017 and with little subordinated debt currently outstanding, a 
debt restructuring does not appear a viable option to strengthen capital at this 
stage.

The ratings could be affirmed and removed from RWN if the bank successfully 
meets its regulatory capital requirement and proceeds successfully with its 
restructuring. An upgrade could be the result of the bank meeting its 
restructuring targets and following a clear turnaround strategy.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

An upgrade of the Support Rating and any upward revision of the Support Rating 
Floor would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to 
support Carige. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view.

SUBORDINATED DEBT

The notes' rating is primarily sensitive to a change in the bank's VR, from 
which it is notched. The notes' rating is also sensitive to a change in notching 
should Fitch change its assessment of loss severity (for example, the notching 
could narrow if non-performing loan levels become less significant relative to 
the layer of junior non-equity capital, either through an increase in the amount 
of the subordinated buffers or through a significant reduction of non-performing 
loans) or relative non-performance risk.

 

The rating actions are as follows: 

Long-Term IDR: downgraded to 'CCC+' from 'B-' and placed on RWN

Short-Term IDR: downgraded to 'C' from 'B' 

Viability Rating: downgraded to 'ccc+' from 'b-' and placed on RWN

Support Rating: affirmed at '5' 

Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor' 

Senior unsecured notes (including EMTN): long-term rating downgraded to 
'CCC+/'RR4' from 'B-'/'RR4' and placed on RWN, Short-term rating downgraded to 
'C' from 'B' 

Tier 2 debt Long-term rating: downgraded to 'CCC-(EXP)'/'RR6 ' from 
'CCC(EXP)'/'RR6' and placed on RWN

    By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
    MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index hovered
near a six-month low on Wednesday as rising hopes for a Brexit
deal lifted the pound, hurting the shares of big multinational
companies.
    The FTSE 100 <.FTSE> retreated by 1.3 percent while the
pan-European STOXX 600 fell 1.6 percent as tech stocks suffered
their worst day since the 2016 Brexit vote and investors became
anxious about rising yields impacting equities.  
    The top UK index fell as sterling <GBP=D3> hit a new 3-1/2
month high on reports that Britain and the European Union had
made progress in negotiations over an Irish border backstop, a
key hurdle in reaching a deal on Britain's planned departure
from the EU in March next year. [nL8N1WQ1LL]
    ""After a summer of heightened tensions, which saw the
markets pricing in the increasing likelihood of a no-deal
Brexit, it appears that both the EU and UK are now prepared to
commit to some form of deal,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, analyst
at ActivTrades in London.
    Data showing the British economy's summer surge turned out
to be stronger than expected, as warm weather spurred consumer
spending and housebuilding, boosted domestically exposed shares
but had little impact on the broader stock market. [nL8N1WQ1LL]
    Several analysts expect Britain and the EU to reach a
negotiated Brexit deal, a scenario that could further boost the
pound and weigh on the relative performance of the FTSE against
global equities. [nL8N1WO45N]
    Further strength in the pound would penalise exporters but
could be a tailwind for domestic stocks. The UK has set March
29, 2019 as the date of its exit from the EU.
    The FTSE 100, which is down 6 percent this year against a
4.4 percent drop in the broader European market, derives 70
percent of its profits from overseas.
    Among the biggest drags on the FTSE 100 were big
multinationals Diageo <DGE.L> and Reckitt Benckiser <RB.L>, down
2.4 and 1 percent respectively. 
    Burberry <BRBY.L> was the worst-performing stock, down 6.2
percent as investors sold shares in the richly valued luxury
sector following a Morgan Stanley downgrade and amid worries
over the key Chinese market. [nP6N1W700F]
    Miners were also a big drag on the index, with BHP Billiton
<BLT.L>, Glencore <GLEN.L>, and Rio Tinto <RIO.L> all falling 2
to 2.3 percent as metals prices eased. [nL8N1WQ2TV]
    Telecoms firm BT <BT.L> was the biggest gainer on the FTSE
100, up 4.2 percent as the broader sector in Europe, seen as a
""defensive"" play favoured during riskier times, was also in
demand. 
    Banks proved the biggest support thanks to recent gains in
global bond yields. Domestically exposed banks Barclays <BARC.L>
and Lloyds <LLOY.L> rose 2.9 percent each. 
    Despite the broader hopes around Brexit, shares in
London-focused homebuilder Telford Homes <TELF.L> tumbled 7
percent after it flagged rising uncertainties ahead of the
country's departure from the EU. [nL4N1WQ2YM]

    CLOSING SNAPSHOT: WORST DAY SINCE JUNE FOR EUROPE AS TECH SINKS (1639 GMT)
    It's been a terrible day for stock markets across Europe and driven most notably by a sharp
selloff in tech and luxury stocks. The tech sector suffered its worst day since the Brexit vote
selloff, down 4.3 percent as concerns over slowing semiconductor demand caused investors to dump
the sector. 
    The STOXX 600 as a whole had its worst day since June 25 as luxury stocks also fell sharply.
Italian banks, for once, weren't the worst hit, managing to stay just flat as banks overall rose
thanks to climbing bond yields. 
    GS strategists note sharp rises in bond yields ""have always been tricky for equities to
digest"", though they ultimately expect the rate move to have a limited effect in the medium
term. 
    Stocks' sensitivity to rising yields ""shows the vulnerability of equities late in the cycle
to greater volatility in other assets,"" they argue. More on this theme tomorrow. 
    We leave you with this chart showing the remarkably steep slide in tech today:

    INVESTORS' MAIN OBSESSIONS, AND WHERE THEY COULD BE WRONG (1437 GMT)
    After a series of meetings Credit Suisse's global equity strategists Andrew Garthwaite and
team summarise what clients are obsessing over the most: 
    * Growth versus Value - clients have been selling growth although they noted we haven't seen
the
extremes of previous growth bubbles (see below). CS remains overweight US growth but benchmark
European growth
    * DM versus EM - clients see deep value in EM equities but see few catalysts with the
dollar, US
rates, oil and China all heading in the wrong direction
    * US versus non-US - CS' survey finds the second-highest proportion of clients who believe
the US
will be the best-performing region over the next 3 months. ""Clients see little reason to add to
continental Europe and there are clear signs of US investor capitulation on the region""

    They think investors could be wrong on the following fronts: 
    * Looking to buy US bonds. Garthwaite and team point out neither the MOVE index of bond
volatility
nor the NY Fed term premium imply we're at a peak in US yields
    * Trade. Most clients don't expect a deal ahead of mid-terms - but CS says ""recent trade
deals
have been better than expected""
    * Pessimism on the cycle. Clients are more pessimistic than at any point in the past 5
years, yet
valuations of cyclicals don't reflect this

    Then there were several areas where clients asked very few questions - which Garthwaite et
al think could indicate complacency. 
    These blind spots included Japan, technology, market direction, quantitative tightening, and
how Trump's policies could change after the mid-terms.

    ""WITHOUT CONVICTIONS AND WITH LOTS OF DOUBT"" (1343 GMT)
    That quote comes from a SocGen note which looks into the outlook for equity volatility in
Q4. 
    It mirrors quite well the angst which has been palpable in morning notes these last few days
after a series of disappointing sessions.
    World equities are very close to mid-August lows and there just doesn't seem to be much
belief in a rebound.
    So what better time, ask SocGen analysts, for investors to review how their portfolios are
hedged, now that volatility may well make a comeback. 
    A combo of a fading tax boost, corporate revenues slowing down, the trade war starting to
hurt and tighter monetary policy could lay the ground for some action in the VIX in 2019, they
reckon. 
    ""We believe that the current low-volatility environment provides an opportunity to prepare
for a rise in risk perception and correction of large imbalances in 2H19,"" SocGen argues. 
    Of course it's always difficult to measure a rise in volatility due to the huge breadth of
levels over the past ten years. 
    As you can see from the chart below, the VIX is still very low if compared to the last
decade but seriously high in  context of the last three months:

    BREXIT DIVIDENDS (AHEM..) (1223 GMT) 
    As hopes of a Brexit deal seem to be on the rise, now is perhaps a good time to have another
look at how the divorce has been treating British equities so far. 
    The chart below shows that when measured in dollars rather than in a weakened pound, the
impact of the EU/UK divorce appears to have been quite negative so far. 
    But with both the EU and Britain signalling progress in recent days, fears about a damaging
no-deal Brexit might actually have been overplayed, who knows?

    SIGNS OF STRAIN AS BREXIT LOOMS OVER LONDON PROPERTY MARKET (1111 GMT)
    The latest wave of optimism on EU divorce talks will undoubtedly reassure those heavily
invested in UK real estate, arguably a no-deal proxy.    
    House sellers are cutting their prices in London and properties are staying on the market
for longer, UBS finds - a negative trend for property companies and housebuilders exposed to the
capital likely to see financial services jobs and EU nationals move away due to Brexit.
    In their analysis using web scrapes of residential property listings, UBS analysts find
reductions have risen to 37 percent of all listings from less than 20 percent in early 2016. The
level of discount in vendors' asking prices has widened to 2.4 percent, and the number of days
on the market has risen to 125 (see below).
    UBS also notes a clear trend with more expensive properties taking longer to sell, with the
widest discounts, calling Kensington & Chelsea ""an extreme case"". 
    The real estate slide may, however, be confined to London rather than spreading through the
country.
    ""In past cycles, a London downturn has pre-empted a wider loss of momentum and decline in
consumer confidence,"" analysts at the Swiss bank write. ""The BoE thinks this time may be
different, as the capital is more exposed than the national market to stamp duty changes and is
more likely to be impacted by the departure of EU nationals.""
    Indeed there's a further indication today of how Brexit is likely to sap demand from the
London property market: Britain's financial services minister says he expects 5,000 financial
services jobs to leave by Brexit Day [nL8N1WQ2F2]

    FOUR REASONS TO SELL LUXURY STOCKS (1003 GMT)
    Luxury is ""so last year"" - that's what Morgan Stanley analysts are saying, in a nutshell, in
a note which is partly responsible for the drop in stocks like LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler,
and Ferragamo today. 
    The selloff in luxury has been building over the past few weeks, and here are MS' four key
reasons to sell the sector. They say it's not too late to do so despite the recent falls:
    1. Luxury is vulnerable to underperformance of growth versus value - 92% of the sector is in
Europe's growth index
    2. Valuations remain elevated despite falling recently (see chart below), and investors are
still
heavily positioned in luxury
    3. Earnings momentum is slowing - analysts have begun downgrading earnings and sales
estimates
    4. China's consumer confidence may have peaked - Morgan Stanley's China economist expects
Chinese
consumption figures for the second half to slow further

    European equity benchmarks have opened without clear direction with the STOXX 600 trading
marginally down but above the six-month lows hit yesterday. 
    In the spotlight are luxury stocks with LVMH <LVMH.PA> falling 5 percent despite a 10
percent sales growth in the third quarter. Other luxury stocks were also down sharply.
    Traders are linking the drop to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley, which has downgraded
the sector to underweight, saying it prefers value stocks over growth.
    ""We believe the recent outperformance of value vs growth has further to go and hence
downgrade the EU Luxury Goods sector to Underweight from a top down perspective,"" they say.
    Here's your snapshot with Europe's country benchmarks.

    NO MOOD SWING ON OUR RADAR (0651 GMT) 
    There's still a slightly negative trend for the futures and it looks like we are set for
another lacklustre start. There does not seem to be enough strong corporate headlines out there
to push the market either way or force a mood swing.
    Interesting to see will be whether European banking supervisors stepping up their monitoring
of liquidity levels at Italian banks will add to stress in Milan. [nL8N1WQ0XV]
    Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved a deal on Wednesday between
British energy suppliers SSE and Npower to merge their retail units.
    In the competitive food delivery sector, Takeaway.com announced third-quarter sales grew by
40 percent in the German market, where it is locked in an expensive fight for dominance with
Delivery Hero. 
    Just as fears the trade war is starting to take its toll on luxury goods, LVMH said its
fashion and handbags business boosted third-quarter sales growth. Trade war challenged European
car makers now will have to comply with the European Union’s will to seek a 35 percent cut in
car emissions by 2030.
    World Cup silver linings with Pub operator Marston's reporting higher sales. Still in
Britain, recruitment firm PageGroup said it expected 2018 operating profit to be marginally
ahead of market forecasts. In Austria, energy group OMV reports a quarter-on-quarter fall in
third-quarter.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES: LACKLUSTRE RED (0614 GMT) 
    European futures have opened to an overall pale red picture even if this probably qualifies
as a lacklustre start.  
    ""Uncertainty is prevailing in the financial markets, we are seeing more investors opting to
wait and see how risks surrounding rising US treasury yields, global growth and China play out"",
wrote Jasper Lawler of LDC in a morning note. 
    He added that while markets have been complacent for a while, ""we are starting to see an
acknowledgement of these risks which is keeping traders on the side-lines"".

    MORNING CALL: NO REASON FOR EUROPE TO RISE (0525 GMT)
    Financial spreadbetters don't seem to have any reason to bet on a rise of European stock
markets after little movement on Wall Street and in Asia. 
    World stocks are still in touching distance of eight-week lows as worries about global
economic growth continue to dampen the mood. 
    London's FTSE is expected to open 12 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 23 points and Paris'
CAC to dip 3 points.

    By Richard Leong
    NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The euro and sterling rose on
Wednesday, underpinned by optimism for a Brexit deal, while the
dollar lost ground against a basket of currencies even as U.S.
bond yields hovered at multiyear peaks.
    The common currency's gains were limited by worries about
the sustainability of Italy's public finances, though Italian
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria reiterated on Wednesday that the
government would do everything in its power to regain the
confidence of financial markets. [nR1N1VZ01R] [nL8N1WQ1DK]
    ""There is more optimism that they will find some agreement
between Britain and (the) European Union before Brexit,"" said
Steve Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard
Chartered Bank in New York.
    This week, Brexit negotiators have hinted at progress toward
terms for Britain to leave the economic bloc in March, which
gave investors hope for an orderly departure. Still, caution
persists due to scant details. [nL8N1WQ1GM]
    On Wednesday, EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said
the two parties have agreed on much of the withdrawal agreement
ahead of a summit of all the bloc's 28 national leaders next
week. [nB5N1U6017]
    The pound <GBP=D3> reached a two-week high at $1.3216
Wednesday and held a gain of 0.45 percent on the day. It hit its
strongest level against the euro <EURGBP=EBS> since June 15 at
87.23 pence.
    The euro <EUR=EBS> rose 0.3 percent to $1.15270 and held
steady at 129.750 yen.
    Some traders remain skeptical about a final Brexit deal.
    ""We see a lot of volatility, so the good news may be a
temporary thing because the EU has been quick to reject most 
proposals even if it has the backing of Labour,"" said Juan
Perez, senior currency trader with Tempus, Inc. in Washington.
    Perez was referring to the U.K. Labour Party whose spokesman
on Wednesday downplayed a news report that some party members
would back a Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May
supports. [nS8N1RN017]
    The bounce in the two currencies offset the effects of an
increase in U.S. Treasury yields, putting pressure on the
dollar.
    Benchmark 10-year yields <US10YT=RR> retreated from a
seven-year high of 3.261 percent set on Tuesday, even as
investors and dealers pared their bond holdings to make space
for $36 billion 3-year and $23 billion 10-year note supply sold
on Wednesday. [nZXN0DEW0E] [nZXN0DEW1E]
    U.S. yields have increased on rising government debt supply
and worries about higher inflation, which may push the Federal
Reserve to raise short-term rates more quickly. 
    The ICE dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback
against six major currencies, fell 0.2 percent on the day to
95.480. It hit a seven-week high on Tuesday at 96.155.

on Thursday said a decision by the European Union to ramp up
trade pressure on Cambodia over human rights concerns was an
""extreme injustice"", adding it risked destroying decades of
development progress in the country.
    The European Union last week said Cambodia would lose its
special access to the world's largest trading bloc as a response
to human rights concerns surrounding a July election which
extended Prime Minister Hun Sen's three decade rule.[nL8N1WL2JW]
    ""The Cambodian government can only take this decision as an
extreme injustice when the EU blatantly disregards the
considerable progress made by the country, despite its recent
tragic past,"" Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a
statement on Thursday.
    ""By implementing these withdrawal measures, the European
Commission risks negating twenty year's worth of development
efforts,"" it added.
    The EU announced that Cambodia would lose its special access
to European markets under the so-called Everything But Arms
(EBA) preferential trade scheme after it conducts a six-month
review of Cambodia's duty-free status.
    Cambodia emerged from decades of war and the genocidal Khmer
Rouge years in the early 1990s. 
    Over the past two decades it has been the world's sixth
fastest-growing economy, with average GDP growth rate of 7.6
percent, according to the World Bank, largely due to its garment
exports which are mostly bound for the EU and the United States.
    Cambodia's exports to the European Union were worth 5
billion euros ($5.8 billion) last year, according to EU data, up
from negligible levels less than a decade ago, with the EU using
its trade policy to help develop Cambodia's economy.
    Rights groups said the July general election was not fair
because of the lack of a credible opposition. 
    The main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP)
was dissolved by the country's Supreme Court at the government's
request last year and did not take part in the election.
    Following the CNRP dissolution Hun Sen's allies ramped up a
crackdown against critics, including opposition politicians and
independent media.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Euro zone corporate debt will be
hit harder and faster than government bonds by the withdrawal of
massive European Central Bank support, which means companies
will see funding costs rise and investors will need to
scrutinise borrowers more carefully.     
    Confident that the economy is in decent shape and inflation
is picking up, the ECB appears set to end its $2.6 trillion ($3
trillion) asset purchase scheme in December. 
    The big unwind from an era of easy money is already under
way - overall ECB monthly bond buying dropped by half in
October. But the end of quantitative easing (QE) comes with a
bigger bump for corporate bonds than for government debt, which
will continue to see massive inflows for some time thanks to
reinvestments from maturing debt already held by the ECB.
    As a result, several European companies are already finding
new debt and refinancing conditions tighter. Corporate borrowing
costs relative to those of governments have risen by around 50
basis points this year, and the pool of negative-yielding
corporate bonds is at its lowest since June 2016.
    Last month, the ECB bought 30 billion euros of debt, which
includes 4.5 billion of corporate bonds, according to analyst
estimates. With monthly purchases cut in half this month, buying
of corporate bonds is estimated at 2.5 billion euros.
    But next year, when purchases are likely to be limited to
reinvestment of maturing debt, corporate debt's share will
shrink faster than that of government debt.
    ECB data shows a monthly average of just 470 million euros
worth of corporate debt maturing over the next 12 months,
compared to government debt maturing at a rate of almost 13
billion euros a month, almost as much as the ECB is buying now.
    And there is still uncertainty over reinvestment policy,
which the ECB has yet to spell out, including how it will deal
with redemptions from asset-backed securities. Some policymakers
have even advocated not rolling over corporate bonds and
spending the proceeds elsewhere, Reuters reported. [nL5N1W052R] 
  
    ""The concern within the market is that reinvestments (in
corporate debt) in 2019 are rather limited,"" said ING's head of
developed market strategy and research Jeroen van den Broek.
    (Interactive chart https://tmsnrt.rs/2Nqxh3Z])
    
    READY OR NOT
    As the ECB's sizeable presence unwinds, the corporate bond
market is already starting to feel the effects. Higher funding
costs could also reduce appetite for mergers and acquisitions,
or push corporates back to the loan market for more concessional
borrowing, bankers and investors said.
    German media company Bertelsmann was unable to find enough
demand to print a seven-year euro-denominated bond in May after
offering a starting price of 45 basis points over mid-swaps, a
risk-free benchmark.
    Bertelsmann returned to the market last month with a
slightly shorter tenor and a starting price of 85 basis points.
The deal, which raised 750 million euros, was finally priced at
65 basis points over. [nL8N1WB3RI]
    ""Companies like Bertelsmann have seen their funding costs
blow out,"" said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate
at Barclays Bank.
    ""You can't see any clearer indication as the end of the
effect of CSPP on the corporate bond market,"" he said, referring
to the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme, the ECB's name for
its corporate bond buying scheme.
    A Bertelsmann spokesperson declined to comment.  
    Bankers and dealers said this factor was only beginning to
surface in the primary market.
    ""We've not had that much issuance since QE was tapered at
the start of October, so I don't think the impact has been felt
yet,"" said a debt syndicate banker in London.
    The segment of the market most at risk is the 25 billion
euros of high yield bonds which only just qualify for ECB
purchases because they have an investment grade rating from one
ratings agency, bankers said. Of this, 19 billion euros of bonds
appear on the ECB's purchase list.
    Access to cheaper funding led to an ""explosion"" in the
amount of single BBB-rated paper in Europe, which is now the
""most mispriced"" segment of the market, Baldini said.
    
    UNCERTAINTY
    ECB QE, launched in March 2015, first focused on the biggest
and most liquid government bond markets but was extended to
include corporate bonds in June 2016. Economists estimate the
ECB now owns about a fifth of the stock of eligible corporate
bonds, versus about a quarter of eligible government debt. 
    Without a boost from ECB buying, bond prices will
increasingly reflect market factors, said Edward Farley, head of
European corporate bonds at PGIM Fixed Income.
    ""Ultimately, this means there will be more focus on
fundamentals and getting those right because you don't have
anybody propping up the market in an artificial way.""
    As a result, the difference between corporate and government
bond yields has widened and the pool of negative-yielding
investment-grade corporate bonds is shrinking.[nL8N1WI1XB]
    (For interactive chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OzhvIJ)
    ""The whole corporate bond market has gone through a drastic
repricing,"" said Baldini at Barclays. 
    He said anticipation of the end of QE has helped push the
euro-denominated European Aggregate Corporate BBB index 50 basis
points wider from January to September, more than double the
widening of the U.S. equivalent. 
    Investment grade corporate bonds still retain a QE premium,
so further spread-widening is likely said Stephen Caprio, global
credit strategist at UBS.
    Farley said the end of QE marks an opportunity, because
prices more accurately reflect risk. Previously, his firm had
been ""very underweight"" ECB-eligible names, because bond spreads
traded so tight.
    ""New issues are now coming at sensible levels rather than
ECB compressed levels,"" he said. ""There are plenty of reasonably
attractive opportunities that just simply weren't there before.""

    Rising rates in the United States have squeezed debtors in
emerging economies from Argentina to Turkey and the euro zone

adjustment of global disequilibrium,"" de Cos said. 
    ""On the debtors' side the lack of automatic adjustment
through exchange rate shifts suggests the need to boost
competitiveness through structural reforms.""
     Higher rates in developed economies, particularly in the
United States, is pressuring emerging markets as funds get
sucked out. That has seen a selloff in emerging market

    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Euro zone corporate debt will be
hit harder and faster than government bonds by the withdrawal of
massive European Central Bank support, which means companies
will see funding costs rise and investors will need to
scrutinise borrowers more carefully.     
    Confident that the economy is in decent shape and inflation
is picking up, the ECB appears set to end its 2.6 trillion
euros($3 trillion) asset purchase scheme in December. 
    The big unwind from an era of easy money is already under
way - overall ECB monthly bond buying dropped by half in
October. But the end of quantitative easing (QE) comes with a
bigger bump for corporate bonds than for government debt, which
will continue to see massive inflows for some time thanks to
reinvestments from maturing debt already held by the ECB.
    As a result, several European companies are already finding
new debt and refinancing conditions tighter. Corporate borrowing
costs relative to those of governments have risen by around 50
basis points this year, and the pool of negative-yielding
corporate bonds is at its lowest since June 2016.
    Last month, the ECB bought 30 billion euros of debt, which
includes 4.5 billion of corporate bonds, according to analyst
estimates. With monthly purchases cut in half this month, buying
of corporate bonds is estimated at 2.5 billion euros.
    But next year, when purchases are likely to be limited to
reinvestment of maturing debt, corporate debt's share will
shrink faster than that of government debt.
    ECB data shows a monthly average of just 470 million euros
worth of corporate debt maturing over the next 12 months,
compared to government debt maturing at a rate of almost 13
billion euros a month, almost as much as the ECB is buying now.
    And there is still uncertainty over reinvestment policy,
which the ECB has yet to spell out, including how it will deal
with redemptions from asset-backed securities. Some policymakers
have even advocated not rolling over corporate bonds and
spending the proceeds elsewhere, Reuters reported. [nL5N1W052R] 
  
    ""The concern within the market is that reinvestments (in
corporate debt) in 2019 are rather limited,"" said ING's head of
developed market strategy and research Jeroen van den Broek.

    READY OR NOT
    As the ECB's sizeable presence unwinds, the corporate bond
market is already starting to feel the effects. Higher funding
costs could also reduce appetite for mergers and acquisitions,
or push corporates back to the loan market for more concessional
borrowing, bankers and investors said.

    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said on Thursday he would advise Labour Party
lawmakers to vote down a Brexit divorce deal that Theresa May is
trying to clinch with the European Union.
    Less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from
the European Union, there is little clarity about how the
world's fifth largest economy and its preeminent international
financial centre will trade with the EU after Brexit.
    Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said voters
should be given another referendum on whether to stay in the EU
as he saw deadlock in British politics.
    If May gets can strike a deal with the EU, she has to get it
approved by the British parliament which is divided on Brexit.
Labour has indicated it is likely to vote down any deal May
brings back. 
    When asked at a Reuters newsmaker in London if he would
advise Labour lawmakers to vote down a possible deal, Blair
said: 
    ""It really is difficult... the alternatives are all worse
because if you do get to a blockage in parliament that is what
opens up the possibility of going back to the people. 
    ""My view is this only happens if there is blockage in
parliament. But if there is blockage in parliament it is a very
simple argument. You say look we have been two and a bit years
trying to reach an agreement that works, parliament is blocked.""
   
    Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the
divorce is Britain’s most significant geopolitical move since
World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the
$2.9 trillion UK economy and the world’s biggest trading bloc.
    Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing
other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and
billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that
Britain could still change its mind.
    Blair said that if Brexit did happen, the economic
dislocation would be such that the United Kingdom would have to
pitch to investors that it would be the best place in the world

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank is in no rush to provide more clarity on how its easy
monetary policy would be tightened, but it will move only very
gradually, policymakers said on the sidelines of the IMF's
annual meeting on Thursday. 
    The ECB has given guidance that asset purchases would end in
December and interest rates would be held steady through next
summer, but has avoided giving more detail, arguing that
inflation developments would be factored in and policy was not
simply on auto pilot.
    ""To be any more precise than that, to lock in a date, to tie
our hands would be rather risky,"" Ardo Hansson, Estonia's
central bank chief said as the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank began on the
Indonesian island of Bali. 
    ""When we get closer, we can have another discussion if we
need to adjust the language again, but this is not a debate we
are going to have just yet,"" Hansson said.
    While most policymakers have argued that the wording implies
no move before the end of the summer, Dutch policymaker Klaas
Knot, an outspoken hawk, recently argued that the guidance was
the midpoint of expectations and the actual move could be ""to
the left or the right of that point"".
    Some uncertainty over inflation may be blurring the outlook,
as underlying price pressures remain weak despite accelerating
wage growth and record employment, a somewhat puzzling outcome
which suggests some invisible slack in the euro zone economy.
    The ECB has undershot its medium term inflation target -
currently set at close to but below 2 percent - for over five
years and its projections show only a very gradual rise even
after years of stimulus. 
    ""Core inflation is still rather weak in the euro zone at
around 1 percent, as it has been for the last couple of years,
so an accommodative monetary policy is still needed in Europe,""
Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said in Bali.
    But Rehn added that rebuilding some of the ECB's firepower
before the next downturn was needed, even if unconventional
policy tools will remain permanent part of its arsenal.

    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The United Kingdom should call a
referendum to allow voters to choose between a no-deal Brexit
and staying in a reformed European Union as British politics is
deadlocked over the issue, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said
on Thursday.
    Less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from
the European Union, there is little clarity about how the
world's fifth largest economy and its preeminent international
financial centre will trade with the EU after Brexit.
    If Prime Minister Theresa May can strike a deal with the EU,
she has to get it approved by the British parliament, which is
deeply divided over Brexit. 
    Some members of her ruling Conservative Party are unhappy
about the Brexit proposals she has made, and the main opposition
Labour Party has indicated it is likely to vote down any deal
May brings back. 
    Blair, a former Labour prime minister, said he did not
expect May to be able to get a deal through parliament so the
country should be offered a new vote.
    ""It really is difficult... The alternatives are all worse
because if you do get to a blockage in parliament that is what
opens up the possibility of going back to the people,"" Blair,
who was premier from 1997 to 2007, told a Reuters newsmaker in
London. 
    ""My view is this only happens if there is blockage in
parliament. But if there is blockage in parliament it is a very
simple argument. You say, look we have been two and a bit years
trying to reach an agreement that works, parliament is blocked.""
   
    Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the
divorce is Britain’s most significant geopolitical move since
World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the
$2.9 trillion UK economy and the world’s biggest trading bloc.
    Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing
other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and
billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that
Britain could still change its mind.
    Blair said that if Brexit did happen, the economic
dislocation would be such that the United Kingdom would have to
pitch to investors that it would be the best place in the world
to do business.

    * Former PM Blair calls for Labour to vote down a May deal

    By Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will meet ministers on Thursday to discuss Brexit, hours
after her parliamentary partner threatened to withdraw its
support if she accepts what it calls a ""draconian solution"" on
offer from the European Union.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU, the
two sides differ on their view of the talks - the bloc says a
withdrawal deal is within reach, while British officials say
""significant obstacles"" still lie in the way of any agreement.
    They do agree on one thing - that time is running out to
seal a deal to pave the way for Britain's divorce, the biggest
trade and foreign policy shift for more than 40 years. As that
departure date creeps closer, those wanting to influence May's
approach to Brexit are stepping up their efforts.
    One of the biggest hurdles is an agreement on the so-called
Irish backstop to prevent the return of a hard border between
the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland
if there is no immediate trade deal. 
    A seamless border is part of the settlement which largely
ended decades of violence in the province.
    Neither side has indicated there has been a deal on the
Irish backstop. But after meetings in Brussels, the Democratic
Unionist Party, which props up the Conservative government in
parliament, has issued a series of terse warnings to May.
    DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson condemned what he said was
the EU's offer for a backstop that would keep Britain in the
customs union for an unspecified time-limited period, would
exclude Northern Ireland from any new British trade deals and
see checks on goods moving from mainland Britain to the
province.
    May's acceptance of such a proposal ""would have implications
not just for Brexit legislation – 50 per cent of which would not
have passed without DUP support – but also for the budget,
welfare reform and other domestic legislation"", he said.
    ""She will not have DUP support regardless of whether the
government tries to bribe, bully or browbeat us into accepting
it,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
    By withdrawing its support, the DUP could make it impossible
for May to pass legislation through parliament, including the
budget which will be voted on later this month.
    
    MEETING
    May will gather several of her ministers later on Thursday
as part of routine meetings to keep her cabinet team updated on
progress in Brexit talks.
    The meeting takes place against growing criticism over her
plans to leave the EU with some Conservative eurosceptic
lawmakers saying they will vote against any deal based on her
so-called ""Chequers"" proposal, named after her country
residence.
    Former prime minister John Major, whose career as leader was
crushed partly by eurosceptics, said the behaviour of some of
those Conservatives was ""an intolerable way to treat a prime
minister who's in the middle of negotiations"". []
    But the parliamentary arithmetic is difficult for May. With
the support of the DUP she commands a majority of only 13
lawmakers and needs to keep either her own party onside or
attract votes from the main opposition Labour Party.
    Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the party will vote
against any deal that does not meet its tests - something the
Chequers plan does not fulfil.
    And former Labour leader Tony Blair added his voice to calls
for the party to vote down May's Brexit divorce deal.

    MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Worsening investor
sentiment caused by the new government’s fiscal binge is hurting
the country’s banks. The weakest ones, like Carige, need
capital, but may struggle to raise it. Either rescuing a bank or
shutting it down would be politically toxic.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Rating agency Fitch on Oct. 10 downgraded Banca Carige’s
long-term rating to CCC-plus from B-minus, saying there was a
“real possibility” the Italian bank could fail.
    - The rating firm said it would be “challenging” for Carige
to replenish its Tier 2 capital buffer, which is currently below
the level demanded by regulators.
    - The European Central Bank has given Carige until the end
of the year to plug the capital hole or find a partner.
Carige’s restructuring has been delayed by a boardroom dispute.
Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino was replaced in September.
    - Carige shares were down 10.2 percent at 0.0044 euros by
0840 GMT. The stock has fallen about 45 percent since the start
of the year.

    AMSTERDAM, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Dutch car leasing company
Leaseplan [AAHALP.UL] on Thursday shelved its plan to float
shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange, blaming a global

    ""Market conditions have deteriorated significantly since our

indicating that market developments late on Wednesday and early
on Thursday had led Leaseplan to drop its plans.
    The spokeswoman declined to comment on any possible future

put secondary shares on offer, without giving further details.

    Since then, a global sell off in stock markets has shaved

euros ($6.9 billion), was sold by Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>  in

Tony Blair said there was a 50-50 chance of getting another
Brexit referendum as Prime Minister Theresa May will be unlikely
to secure a majority for any divorce deal in parliament.
    ""Whatever Brexit is on offer today is going to result in
significant economic harm,"" Blair, who served as prime minister
from 1997 to 2007, told Reuters.
    ""I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped, I
think there is no majority in parliament for any proposition

wanted a second referendum.
    Less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from

world's fifth largest economy and its preeminent international
financial centre will trade with the EU after Brexit.
    May is trying to clinches a deal but there is uncertainty on
whether she could sell it at home, where she will need approval
from the British parliament.
    Blair said European regulators would not want the centre of
European finance to be outside their orbit so jobs would be lost
in the financial sector.
    ""Why give ourselves this problem in a field of the global
economy where we are globally preeminent?"" Blair said, adding
that the government had cast aside the interests of the service
sector.
    Blair said that if Brexit did go ahead and was followed by a
Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, then the country would
face a ""truly damaging and challenging situation"".
    ""This is the problem with the policies of both major
parties: they seem to think you can do Brexit and then engage is
a whole lot of social legislation to make capitalism fairer and
more equal and so on,"" Blair said.
    ""They have got to wake up to the fact that if you do Brexit
your number one priority is going to be keeping this place as an

Britain for tourism or work fell by the most in nearly a decade
during the three months to June, showing the country could not
sustain the record numbers achieved a year earlier in the wake
of 2016's Brexit vote.
    The pound's fall after Britain voted to leave the European
Union in June 2016 made the country a cheaper holiday
destination, boosting visitor numbers in the second and third
quarters of 2017 - peak holiday season - to record highs.
    However, Thursday's data from the Office for National
Statistics show Britain has been unable to sustain these gains,
with the segment of highly price-sensitive visitors possibly
having been exhausted.
    Foreign visitor numbers in the three months to June dropped
by 7.7 percent compared with a year earlier to 10.038 million,
the largest percentage drop since the depths of the global
financial crisis in early 2009.
    The number of North American visitors fell by 10 percent,
European visitors dropped by 8 percent and there was a 6 percent
fall in visitors from elsewhere.
    Tourism, the most common reason for a visit, was down by 8
percent, business trips fell by 15 percent while visits to see
friends and family rose by 6 percent.
    Total spending by foreign visitors fell by 10.3 percent
compared with a year earlier to 5.839 billion pounds ($7.70
billion).
    The ONS offered no reasons for the declining numbers.
    The number of Britons travelling abroad barely changed at
19.868 million, and their spending held steady at 11.629 billion
pounds. More Britons visited North America at the expense of
other non-European destinations.
    Last year the United Nations estimated Britain was the
world's seventh-biggest international tourist destination by
visitor numbers, slipping one spot in the rankings behind
Mexico. The most visited country was France.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - European Commission Vice
President Jyrki Katainen urged Italy on Thursday to submit a
draft budget that was in line with its previous commitments and
warned of risks for Italy and other euro zone states.
    ""The situation is very fragile,"" he told reporters when
asked about Italy's budgetary plans and initially negative
market reactions. 
    He added that no one wanted financial instability that could
hit Italy and other euro zone countries ""that may suffer from
contagion risks"".
    Katainen, who is responsible for jobs and growth, said the
Commission was still trying to convince Italy to change its
budget plans, which at the moment are likely to flout EU fiscal
rules.
    ""Everybody has seen the situation in the markets, which is
not positive,"" he said, referring to reactions to the Italian
plans.
    ""Our interest is to get a result which is credible and try
to convince the Italian government to take the responsibility,
which lies in the hands of them,"" he added.
    Italy and all other euro zone states have to submit their
draft budgets for next year to Brussels by Oct. 15. 
    ""We do hope we can get a good cooperation with the Italian
government,"" Katainen said, adding: ""It is not too late to
maintain stability. It is not too late to make sure that growth
can continue in Italy.""

slow euro zone growth further, and European Central Bank
policymakers debated last month whether to downgrade their risk
assessment, minutes of their September meeting showed on
Thursday.
    But policymakers ultimately decided that the domestic
economy was showing considerable resilience, so risks to growth
remained balanced, even if some argued that the factors behind
the recent slowdown may not be temporary, the ECB said in the
accounts of the Sept 13 meeting.
    The ECB kept policy unchanged as expected last month,
staying on track to wrap up a 2.6 trillion-euro ($3
trillion)bond purchases scheme this year and raise interest
rates next autumn, even as it warned that risks from
protectionism were growing [nL5N1VZ1K2].

there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to
domestic demand."" 
    Still, while some policymakers argued that the case could be
made for downgrading the risk assessment, there was agreement
that the underlying strength of the economy would mitigate the
downside risks to activity.
    Rate setters also concluded that the actual impact of trade
tensions has been limited so far, even if there could still be
an impact over time.
    ""High-frequency indicators had stabilised and remained at
elevated levels, underlining the overall robustness of economic
activity,"" chief economist Peter Praet told policymakers,
according to the minutes.
    With years of unprecedented stimulus are finally lifting
inflation and the ECB has been dialling back support, but only
by the smallest of increments, fearing that bigger moves risked
unravelling its work. 
    While the ECB has not explicitly pledged any rate hikes,
policymakers, including Praet, have argued that they were
comfortable with market expectation for a small increase in the
fourth quarter of 2019, followed by only small and infrequent
moves [nL8N1WB23P].
    Policymakers also concluded that domestic cost pressures
continued to build and broaden, indicating that inflation would
rise, moving back towards the bank's target of almost 2 percent
after undershooting it for over five years. 
    A slowdown in growth and the rising threat of protectionism
has also been adding to the ECB's caution. Some policymakers
have warned that external risks, ranging from trade tensions to
an emerging market shakeout and Brexit, could derail global
growth.
    Indeed, earlier this week the International Monetary Fund
cut its global economic growth forecast for this year and next,
saying that the U.S.-China trade war was taking a toll and
emerging markets were struggling with tighter liquidity and
capital outflows [nL2N1WP03N].

    By Balazs Koranyi
    FRANKFURT, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Global trade tensions could
slow euro zone growth further and European Central Bank
policymakers debated last month whether to downgrade their risk
assessment, minutes of their September meeting showed on
Thursday.
    But policymakers ultimately concluded that the domestic
economy was showing enough resilience to consider risks broadly
balanced, even if some argued that the factors behind the recent
slowdown may not be temporary as earlier thought, the ECB said
in the accounts of the Sept 13 meeting.
    The ECB kept policy unchanged as expected last month,
staying on track to wrap up a 2.6 trillion-euro ($3
trillion)bond purchases scheme this year and raise interest
rates next autumn, continuing its slow but steady pace of policy
tightening. [nL5N1VZ1K2].
    Indeed, even as trade tensions weighed on growth and a stock
market selloff amplified growth fears, some policymakers argued
that was not enough for the bank to backtrack on policy
normalisation. 
    ""A gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation is
justified,"" Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said in
Indonesia on Thursday. ""The current strength of the euro area
economy supports our confidence that inflation will converge
towards ... the ECB's price stability target."" 
    But some policymakers appear to be increasingly cautions,
according to the minutes.
    ""A remark was made that some of the factors behind the
(downward growth) revisions might not be entirely of a
transitory nature,"" the minutes showed. ""It was also argued that
there could be larger spillovers from weaker external demand to

    ""To be any more precise than that, to lock in a date, to tie
our hands, would be rather risky,"" Ardo Hansson, Estonia's
central bank chief said at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund on Thursday.
    ""When we get closer, we can have another discussion if we
need to adjust the language again, but this is not a debate we
are going to have just yet,"" Hansson said.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Italian bond yields rose again on
Wednesday, with investors turning their attention to the
country's credit ratings outlook after a senior Moody's
Analytics economist told a newspaper that Italy's budget plan
was ""a mistake."" 
    Italian bond yields rose up to 11 basis points in early
trade following a volatile session on Tuesday. 
    Analysts attribute the move to the La Stampa newspaper
report citing Mark Zandi. [nL8N1WQ0PY] Moody's Analytics is a
subsidiary of Moody's Corporation that focuses on non-ratings
activity.
    A downgrade of the Italian debt by credit rating agencies is
possible, a prominent lawmaker of the ruling League party said
on Wednesday, as market concern over the financial
sustainability of the new government budget targets mounted.
    Leaders of the ruling coalition, Luigi di Maio and Matteo
Salvini, on Wednesday reiterated that the budget would not be
amended.
    ""Investors are very sensitive regarding the ratings
outlook,"" said Rene Albrecht, rates strategist at DZ Bank. 
    ""Any news about ratings actions is moving BTPs. Rome is not
just on a collision course with Brussels but also with the
ratings agencies.""
    Moody's and S&P Global, which both rate Italy two notches
above junk, are due to provide an updated opinion on Italy's
credit rating in the second half of October. Analysts say around
one downgrade is already priced in. [nL8N1WP4QO]
    ""The outlook after the downgrade is now the focus,"" said
Albrecht. ""It will be a volatile session again but we think the
government is now more spread-sensitive.""
    Analysts say that should the spread of Italy's 10-year bond
yield over Germany remain above a 300 basis point ""threshold""
the government would likely move to soothe markets.  
    The gap was at around 303 bps on Wednesday, having hit a
five-year high around 316 on Tuesday <DE10IT10YT=RR>.
    Italy's 10-year bond yield was six basis points higher on
the day at 3.59 percent but off 4-1/2 year highs hit on Tuesday
<IT10YT=RR>.
    
    Its two and five-year bond yields were around seven basis
points higher. <IT2YT=RR>, <IT5YT=RR>.
    Investors will be looking for further direction from Economy
Minister Giovanni Tria, who is due to speak at 10:00 am local
tome. Tria on Tuesday pledged to do whatever was necessary to
restore calm if market turbulence triggered a financial crisis,
helping to stem the selling of Italian bonds, known as BTPs.
    European banking supervisors have stepped up their
monitoring of liquidity levels at Italian banks after the sharp
increase in bond yields, though there was no cause for alarm, a
senior EU source said on Tuesday. [nL8N1WQ0XV]
    Elsewhere euro zone bond yields were up to one basis point
higher, with Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the
region, at 0.542 percent <DE10YT=RR>, <FR10YT=RR>.

    DUBLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Northern Irish party that
British Prime Minister Theresa May's government relies on for
support said on Thursday it would consider supporting a vote of
no-confidence if May agrees to EU checks on goods entering the
region in Brexit talks. 
    Democratic Unionist Party Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told
Ireland's RTE radio the party's 10 members of parliament would
vote against the UK budget and would consider voting
no-confidence in May if the British government breaks the DUP's
red lines in Brexit talks. 
    ""If she agrees a deal which breaks her own promises, then I
think we have no alternative,"" Wilson said when asked if the DUP
would vote against the British budget. ""In breaking her promises
she would be agreeing to break up the United Kingdom,"" he said.
    The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday said
Britain must accept possible checks on goods moving between its
mainland and its province of Northern Ireland, saying Brexit
would trigger the need for customs, value-added tax and
compliance checks with EU standards.
    Wilson said such a deal ""would in effect have Northern
Ireland ruled by the EU rather than London"" and would exclude
Northern Ireland from future UK trade deals. Barnier's
suggestion was ""gratuitous constitutional vandalism"" he said. 
    Wilson said the party would firstly ""decide whether or not
voting against the budget is the appropriate way of showing our
dissatisfaction."" 
    For the government to fall there would have to be a
subsequent vote of no confidence. ""What we would do in those
circumstances is something we would have to discuss,"" he said. 
    But he said he did not think May necessarily had to make a
choice between an exit deal with the European Union and
maintaining the support of the DUP. 
    ""I don't believe that is the choice. I believe that she
should be insisting on the kind of deal with the EU that she has
been promising to people in the United Kingdom.""
    He suggested an alternative compromise would be for the EU
to defend its single market by agreeing to virtual checks on
goods crossing from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland.

auction of non-performing loans of five bankrupt banks,
totalling 240 million euros ($278 million), the country's
Deposit Insurance Agency said on Thursday.
    The agency is selling bad loans of the PB Agrobanka, the
Nova Agrobanka, the Univerzal Banka, the Privredna Banka Beograd
and the Razvojna Banka Vojvodine, which have all gone bankrupt
since 2000.
    The deadline for submitting binding bids is set for Dec. 7
and the whole process should be completed by the end of the
year, the agency said. 
    The agency said in a statement on its website that it would
not ""provide guarantees for the collection of receivables ...
nor for the enforceability of collaterals."" 
    It offered no details about expectations from the sale.
Agency officials were not available for comment. 
    The ratio of non-performing loans in Serbia's banking sector
stood at 7.8 percent at the end of June, the central bank said
last month. 
    In May 2015, when the Serbian government and the World
Bank’s International Finance Corporation agreed to improve
bankruptcy legislation and out-of-court settlements, bad loans
accounted for 23 percent.
    In August 2015, the central bank adopted its strategy to
tackle bad loans and upgraded the system by which banks report
on collateral, interest rates and their exposure to their
biggest debtors. 
    Serbia's Finance Minister Sinisa Mali said in a statement
that the portfolio on offer was ""carefully selected"" as it
offers a ""degree of certainty"" in the collection of receivables.
    ""With the successful sale (of the portfolio), we expect that
the assets ... will go back to the economic flows, contributing
to the growth of Serbia's economy,"" Mali said. 
    In 2019, the ministry plans to offer a portfolio of
non-performing loans with a nominal value of between 700 and 800
million euros, Mali said.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona-October 11: Fitch Ratings has upgraded Banco BPI S.A.'s 
Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' and Short-Term IDR to 
'F2' from 'F3'. Banco BPI's 'bb+' Viability Rating is unaffected by today's 
rating action. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action 
commentary.

The upgrades follow a similar action of Banco BPI's parent bank, CaixaBank S.A. 
(see ""Fitch Upgrades CaixaBank to 'BBB+' on Reduced Capital Encumbrance"" dated 8 
October 2018 at www.fitchratings.com).

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATING

The IDRs, senior debt ratings and Support Rating of Banco BPI reflect a high 
probability of support from its ultimate parent, CaixaBank, S.A. (BBB+/Stable), 
in case of need. The Stable Outlook mirrors that of CaixaBank. The Short-Term 
IDR of 'F2' maps to the higher of two options for the 'BBB' Long-Term IDR 
because we view the propensity to support as more certain in the near term.

Fitch believes Portugal is a strategically important market for CaixaBank as 
demonstrated by its longstanding investment in Banco BPI and its involvement in 
the design and implementation of the strategic objectives of its subsidiary. The 
sale in November 2017 of some of Banco BPI's insurance, asset management, credit 
cards and corporate finance businesses to CaixaBank reflects further 
integration.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY 

The IDRs of Banco Portugues de Investimento S.A. (BPI) are equalised with those 
of its parent, Banco BPI. As well as its 100% ownership by Banco BPI, BPI's 
integration with and role within Banco BPI mean there is a high probability of 
the subsidiary being supported by Banco BPI. We believe support from CaixaBank 
would be allowed to flow through to BPI as reflected by the recent intragroup 
transaction that saw CaixaBank acquire some of BPI's businesses. Fitch does not 
assign a VR to this institution as the agency does not view it as an independent 
entity.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATING

Banco BPI's Long-Term IDR and senior debt ratings could be upgraded if the 
Long-Term IDR of CaixaBank is upgraded or if we view CaixaBank's propensity to 
provide support has increased. However, any upside on Banco BPI's Long-term IDR 
would be limited to one notch above Portugal's sovereign rating. This is because 
Fitch believes CaixaBank's propensity to support Banco BPI is linked to 
Portugal's operating environment, since this affects its attractiveness to the 
group and its impact on CaixaBank's overall risk and returns profile. 

The ratings would likely be downgraded if CaixaBank's ability to provide support 
is reduced, reflected by a downgrade of the parent's ratings, or if Fitch has 
reason to believe that Banco BPI has become less strategically important to 
CaixaBank. 

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

The ratings of BPI are primarily sensitive to changes in Banco BPI's IDRs.

 

The rating actions are as follows: 

Banco BPI

Long-Term IDR upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', Outlook Stable 

Short-Term IDR: upgraded to 'F2' from 'F3' 

Viability Rating unaffected at 'bb+'' 

Support Rating: affirmed at '2'

Senior unsecured debt long-term rating: upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'

Senior unsecured debt short-term rating: upgraded to 'F2' from 'F3' 

Banco Portugues de Investimento

    By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
    MILAN/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The third-quarter reporting
season kicks off this week with European companies on track for
a second year of solid profit growth, but investors are shunning
them even though valuations have not been this cheap since the
euro zone crisis.
    As a result, European companies cannot afford to disappoint
market expectations if they want to attract investors back to a
region they have spurned in favour of Wall Street. 
    European equities have been a painful trade this year, as
political turmoil and the region's vulnerability to trade risks
starkly contrasted with the allure of tax cuts, stock buybacks
and a booming economy in the United States.
    Even a developing stock market rout in the United States and
Europe this week hit Europe harder, taking the S&P 500 <.SPX> -
fresh from record highs - to its lowest in just three months
while the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark hit a
21-month low.
    ""There's good reason to expect European growth is going to
remain solid going forward but the U.S. is still going to be
leading the global cycle,"" Richard Turnill, global chief
investment strategist at BlackRock, said.
    ""Overall the outlook is somewhat weaker [for Europe]. It's
roughly half what we expect from the U.S. over the next twelve
months. And geopolitical risks are likely to be a continued
overhang for European stocks,"" he added. 
    Wall Street's biggest banks formally kick off the results
season on Friday. 
    Overall according to IBES Refinitiv, third-quarter company
earnings in Europe are expected to have increased 14 percent
year-on-year, against the 21.4 percent growth expected for the
S&P 500.
    Europe's main equity index <.STOXX> hit its lowest level
since December 2016 on Thursday, bringing its underperformance
versus the S&P 500 <.SPX> this year to 11.7 percent.    
    That has sunk European equity valuations to extreme levels.
The discount to U.S. stocks is nearing 20 percent - a gap last
seen during the 2009-2012 sovereign debt crisis which prompted
hefty monetary policy easing in the euro zone.
    Being cheap has not been enough to attract inflows, though.
    After being a popular global trade in 2017 the tide has
rapidly turned for European equities on the back of economic and
earnings disappointments.     
    As Britain's Brexit deadline nears and Italy seeks to loosen
fiscal discipline, investors have pulled money out of European
equity funds in 25 weeks out of the past 30, according to the
latest figures from U.S.-based fund tracker EPFR Global.
    ""A lot of money has flowed out of European equities and I
think that most investors are now waiting on the sidelines for
confirmation that the situation is improving,"" Pierre Bose, head
of European Strategy, International Wealth Management at Credit
Suisse in Zurich, said.
    ""For the over-allocation that you had to European equities
at the end of last year you haven't been rewarded. You have
withdrawn that positioning and haven't got an incentive at the
moment to allocate to Europe away from other regions,"" he added.
        
 
    ""THAT MAKES INVESTORS NERVOUS""   
    The gloomy outlook on Europe's trade-sensitive economy and
fragmented politics has clouded the view on earnings. 
    Even though European earnings are expected to rise 8 percent
this year after growing 12 percent in 2017, over the last few
weeks analysts' earnings downgrades have outnumbered upgrades.
    ""That makes investors a bit nervous,"" Christian Stocker,
equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich, said. 
    ""This normally heralds some pressure and for the next few
quarters I expect a significant slowdown in earnings growth for
the euro zone,"" he added.
    Against this backdrop, European companies' valuation
multiples are unlikely to increase any time soon, at least until
Brexit, Italy and trade war clouds are cleared.
    To be sure, some investors are confident companies can
deliver enough to push prices back up.
    ""We expect some deal as far as Brexit is concerned, and that
the Italian situation will sort itself out, and the gap in
Economic Surprise Index versus the US suggests the numbers
posted in Europe should be relatively good,"" Charles de
Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity
strategy at Societe Generale in Paris, said. 
    Citi's economic surprise index for the euro zone has risen
since June, an indication economists are beginning to up their
expectations for the bloc, while the U.S. index has fallen.    
    VALUATION STRESS DRIVES EARNINGS FOCUS
    While investors recoil from cheap autos and banking stocks,
highly-valued luxury and tech sectors no longer seem to be a
safe place to hide. That was clear this week when luxury stocks
sank and Europe's tech sector <.SX8P> had its worst day since
the Brexit vote, while in the U.S. the tech-heavy Nasdaq had its
biggest fall in seven years.
    Europe's dearth of tech - the engine of the global rally -
has hurt it on the up but could provide helpful insulation in a
selloff focusing on the most expensive parts of the market.
    The renewed focus on valuations suggests any recovery in
European stocks hinges on companies' ability to deliver strong
earnings. Any disappointment is likely to cause a bigger dent
than the boost from positive surprises.
    ""Given all the uncertainty from Italy and trade tensions I
do not expect we have room for (valuation) multiple expansion,""
UniCredit's Stocker said. ""The remaining potential for the
European equity market is still earnings growth.""
    Credit Suisse's Bose said it was unlikely that European
stocks would be able to offset the macro headwinds over the next
four to six weeks as they report their earnings updates.  
    ""I think what people will be looking for is ... just for
companies to match expectations,"" he said.

    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Sterling rose against a weaker
dollar on Thursday on hopes of a Brexit deal, but concern among
investors about the Ireland border issue kept gains in check.
    Hopes are building that a trade deal between the European
Union and Britain can be struck before an EU summit on Oct. 18.
    The pound has risen for three consecutive days and was
buoyed by comments on Wednesday from the EU's Brexit negotiator
Michel Barnier suggesting a deal next week was
imminent.[nL8N1WQ1GM]
    Sterling rose 0.3 percent to $1.3250, nearing a three-month
high of $1.3295. At 1330 GMT, it was 0.2 percent down versus a
resurgent euro at 87.41 pence. <EURGBP=D3>
    Doubts over whether the fraught issue of EU checks on goods
entering Northern Ireland can be overcome remains, and that is
stopping some traders from unwinding their short bets on the
currency.
    ""Though investors believe that 80 percent of the work on the
Brexit deal framework may be over, it is the last 20 percent
that is the most difficult,"" said Thomas Flury, head of currency
strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment
Office in Zurich.
    ""We have a short pound position against the dollar around
$1.31 as we believe there is more political uncertainty in
store,"" he said.
    The EU's Barnier says Britain must accept possible checks on
goods moving between its main island and its province of
Northern Ireland.
    But the Northern Irish party that British Prime Minister
Theresa May's government relies on for support has threatened to
challenge her leadership if their wishes aren't respected on the
Irish border.
    ""Building optimism over a potential breakthrough in Brexit
talks at next week's summit is continuing to encourage pound
outperformance,"" said analysts at MUFG.
    The analysts said that if a no-deal exit from the bloc was
avoided the currency could strengthen another 5 to 10 percent in
the coming months.
    May will brief her cabinet on the progress of Brexit
negotiations on Tuesday before she heads to Brussels for the EU
summit [nL9N1SI02I][nS8N1TG01Z].

    * Moscovici says markets watching Italy closely

    By Jan Strupczewski
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Italy's fiscal
policy must lead to debt reduction because policies that raise
debt are not good for the Italian people, European Commissioner
for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici said before Italy sends
its draft budget for scrutiny in Brussels.
    Italy's populist government is to present to the European
Commission on Monday its draft budget for 2019, which assumes a
deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, three times as
much as foreseen by the previous government.
    This means a higher structural deficit -- which excludes
one-offs and business cycle swings -- which in turn means higher
public debt in a country which already has a debt-to-GDP ratio
of 133 percent, the second highest in Europe after Greece.
    ""I understand that the Italian government wants to implement
programmes to fight poverty, for social inclusion or for
investment. But this is perfectly compatible with serious public
finances and is a matter of political choice,"" Moscovici told
Reuters in an interview.
    ""If debt rises, in the end, who pays? The Italian citizens.
So a budget that would increase public debt would be a budget
against Italian people,"" he said on the sidelines of the
International Monetary Fund's annual meetings in Indonesia. 
    The draft Italian budget also raised concern on financial
markets. Italian three-year bond yields rose to five year highs
at an auction on Thursday and benchmark 10-year paper traded at
4-1/2-year highs. 
    Many officials are privately concerned about the possibility
of Italy sparking another sovereign debt crisis like the one
triggered by Greece in 2010 that nearly destroyed the euro zone.
Italy's economy is almost 10 times bigger than Greece's.
    ""We don't want a crisis, neither a political crisis nor a
financial crisis. With a minimum of goodwill we can avoid bad
scenarios,"" Moscovici said.
    But the Italian government reiterated on Thursday it would
not backtrack on its 2019 budget plan regardless of mounting
market concern over its financial sustainability.
    ""We will not take a step back. We'll invest in jobs and
economic growth,"" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said.
    Moscovici struck a more conciliatory tone.
    ""I do not want us to be in a confrontational mood, because
it leads us nowhere. Rome vs Brussels is absurd, because Italy
is so close to the heart of Europe,"" he said.
    
    'RULES MUST BE MET'
    Moscovici said he would travel to Rome next Thursday and
Friday to discuss the budget with Finance Minister Giovanni Tria
and other officials to find a solution. The commission's focus
is on Italy's structural deficit, which under the rules should
fall by 0.6 percent of GDP next year, but under the current plan
is to rise by 0.8 percent of GDP.
    ""It is clear that there might be a gap at the end of the
dialogue, but we need to reduce that gap,"" Moscovici said.
    ""We have shown a lot of flexibility to Italy and I am not
talking about that anymore. Rules have to be met. You talked
about markets -- everybody will be watchful about the direction
of the movements -- whether they tend to increase the deficit or
decrease it,"" he said.
    The draft Italian budget assumes economic growth of 1.5
percent, that is to accelerate to 1.6 percent in 2020 and slow
slightly to 1.4 percent in 2021. These forecasts are seen as
optimistic by euro zone officials and by the Italian Fiscal
Board, an independent body set up to check budget assumptions.
    ""Of course the forecast on public finances is linked to the
forecast on growth,"" Moscovici said.
    If Italy's deficit targets do not change the Commission has
the right to reject the draft budget and demand a new one -- a
move it has never resorted to so far.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 11: Fitch Ratings has assigned London Merchant 
Securities Limited's (LMS) GBP175 million 6.5% senior secured bond due 16 March 
2026, a rating of 'A+'.

LMS is an entity fully owned by Derwent London Plc (Derwent, A-/Stable) 
following the merger between LMS and Derwent Valley Holdings plc in 2007. At the 
time of the merger, the portfolio of LMS and its subsidiaries contributed 
properties mainly located in the London borough of Islington (Central and North 
London) and Westminster (West End area).

Fitch rates Derwent's senior unsecured debt at 'A', applying the generic REIT 
sector one-notch uplift from the group's IDR. The additional notching applied to 
LMS's senior secured debt is based on Fitch's Corporates Notching and Recovery 
Ratings Criteria dated 23 March 2018. Fitch expects the secured bond to have a 
regularly reported minimum asset cover of secured debt covenant and a 
satisfactory rental-derived interest cover of at least 1.5x each.

The 'A+' rating assigned to the senior secured bonds issued by LMS also reflects 
their superior recoveries, relying on a charging group composed of four 
property-owning subsidiaries with a portfolio of assets valued GBP572.4 million 
as at end-2017.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

London-focussed Office Portfolio: Derwent's portfolio is almost entirely 
composed of offices located in central London, with a particular focus on the 
West End and the area surrounding the City of London - where the company has no 
exposure. The quality of the assets under management and their improvement over 
the years, together with the robustness and variety of its tenants, contribute 
to a stable revenue stream.

Strong Credit Metrics: Derwent's credit ratios are strong relative to similarly 
rated peers', positioning the company among Fitch's higher-rated EMEA real 
estate peers. Fitch expects Derwent's net-debt -to-EBITDA to peak at just under 
8.0x during the forecast period of 2018-2021; at end-2017 Fitch-adjusted net 
debt-to-EBITDA was around 5x and the company's loan-to-value (LTV) was 15% . The 
company has more than doubled in size by the value of its property portfolio to 
GBP4.9 billion since 2008, but also reduced its debt quantum, showing a cautious 
through-the-cycle approach to leverage.

Strong Operating Performance: Derwent's differentiated property portfolio and 
active management of tenants has ensured that demand for the portfolio's offices 
has remained resilient through-the-cycle. At end-2017 the vacancy rate was 1.3%, 
lower than its 10-year average of 2.6%. Like-for-like (lfl) net rental income 
and valuations were also strong in 2017, increasing 5.5% and 3.9% respectively. 
Valuation increases were driven by outperformance of the Paddington, Old Street 
and Shoreditch villages, which offset some weakness in the West End.

Low Appetite for High-risk Development: Through a mix of careful risk 
management, cost monitoring and project management paired with a history of 
strong pre-letting activity, we view Derwent's development as low-risk. 
Committed development cost to complete was 6% of the investment property 
portfolio at end-2017, confirming the company's low speculative appetite.

Some Tenant Concentration: The top 10 tenants represented 35% of Derwent's net 
rental income at end-2017, higher than similarly rated The British Land Company 
Plc's estimated 30% of contracted rent. The majority of Derwent's exposure is to 
the media, marketing, advertising, professional services sectors and retail head 
offices. The financial sector, which is expected to be more vulnerable to 
Brexit, only represents 4% of net rental income. The top tenants include: 
Burberry (7.1%), Expedia (5.4%) and the UK government (4.9%). At end-2017, the 
average lease length to first break is six years, but this increases to 7.8 
years if pre-lets are included.

Simple Group Structure: Despite a number of entities that constitute Derwent, 
the group structure is straightforward, with most borrowings undertaken by the 
parent company. The number of assets held in joint ventures (JV) is limited. 
Currently, the company has only one significant JV related to the re-development 
of 19-35 Baker Street, an office-led scheme where it owns a 55% interest (the 
remainder owned by The Portman Estate). The debt within this joint venture is 
fully consolidated.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

Derwent is the only Fitch-rated REIT fully focussed on one single segment 
(offices) in a single area (London). Its closest peer, The British Land Company 
Plc (A-/Stable) has greater diversification both in terms of location -being 
present throughout the UK -and asset portfolio (offices and retail). Other 
high-rated issuers, such as Hammerson Plc (BBB+/Stable), focus on retail assets 
with some geographic spread across Europe, while Unibail-Rodamco SE (A/RWN) is 
the highest Fitch-rated retail asset owner, reflecting its superior scale (EUR30 
billion), high quality of assets and substantial diversification.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

- No like-for-like rental growth

- 92% of lease expiries either retained or re-let

- Capex of around GBP620 million in 2018-2021, excluding any capitalised 
interest during the period

- Acquisition of around GBP200 million and disposals of around GBP240 million in 
2018-2021

- Dividends increasing around 10% per annum in 2018-2021

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

- Material tenant and rental diversification of the portfolio with financial 
metrics being maintained

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- Fitch-adjusted LTV above 35% on a sustained basis

- Fitch-adjusted net debt / EBITDA above 8.0x on a sustained basis

- EBITDA net interest cover below 3.0x (2017: 4.4x) on a sustained basis

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

Comfortable Liquidity: At end-2017, Derwent had GBP87 million of cash and GBP436 
million undrawn revolving credit facilities. There are no debt maturities in 
2018, with the next maturity being the GBP150 million convertible bond due July 
2019. At end-2017, the company had GBP265 million of committed capex.

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): ""No-Deal"" Brexit Rating Impact

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10047553

Fitch Ratings-London-October 11: The automotive, aerospace, retail, real estate 
and airline sectors are all exposed to a ""no-deal"" Brexit, Fitch Ratings says. 
The risk to individual issuers varies with their size, diversification and 
financial strength. Among financial institutions, medium-sized and specialist 
lenders are more exposed than major UK banks. 

Recent comments by EU and UK negotiators suggest that a withdrawal agreement is 
taking shape, but a no-deal outcome remains possible. We assess the potential 
impact on Fitch-rated issuers using two scenarios. Both involve a recession in 
2019 followed by a recovery, and higher inflation and sterling depreciation. 
Ratings pressures are generally limited in our mild recession scenario, but 
start to emerge in the more severe scenario. 

UK banks are well-positioned from a funding and liquidity perspective and may 
only face challenges if wholesale markets are disrupted for a lengthy period. 
Their ratings should be able to withstand economic deterioration in the no-deal 
scenarios. There would be some pressure on asset quality and earnings from a 
relatively short UK recession, but capitalisation is sound. However, certain 
specialist lenders targeting niche segments, building societies and medium-sized 
banks lacking business diversification are more exposed. 

Contractual disruptions on derivatives are not factored into our scenarios on 
the expectation of an interim solution, but there would be significant negative 
consequences for banks and financial stability if this did not happen. 

UK retailers (particularly non-food) are already under pressure from online 
shopping and subdued consumer confidence. A no-deal Brexit could add to these 
pressures as import duties, sterling weakness and potential staff shortages push 
up costs. Initial stock shortages are possible. Food discounters that have 
previously gained from consumers trading down may see less benefit if they 
source stock from EU countries. 

Auto sector exposure is via lower new vehicle sales, higher costs and disruption 
to supply chains. Tariffs, if passed on fully to buyers, would increase the cost 
of vehicles imported to the UK from the EU by an estimated GBP1,500 on average. 
Tariffs on exports to the EU could put UK manufacturing operations at a pricing 
disadvantage. Geographic and end-market diversification can mitigate these 
effects. 

The aerospace sector would face similar supply-chain challenges, although 
tariffs under WTO rules would be lower than for autos. Restrictions on labour 
movement could be disruptive as larger companies regularly move personnel across 
borders at short notice. Aerospace issuers generally have less rating headroom 
than auto issuers. 

Rated airlines have demonstrated their capacity to cope with significant 
short-term disruption. New traffic rights agreements may be less favourable than 
existing ones. Short-term trade and travel disruptions would affect ports and 
airports, which are also exposed to medium-term volume risk. 

A no-deal exit from the EU could put pressure on tenants of commercial property 
companies, particularly in London offices. But the most exposed Fitch-rated 
property companies have scaled back development, sold non-core assets and 
reduced debt. 

Fitch-rated UK insurers either already conduct their business in the EU27 
through local subsidiaries or have set up subsidiary operations in the EEA, 
mitigating the impact of the loss of passporting arrangements. We understand 
that most large UK insurers have started putting contingency plans in place to 
allow for claim payments post Brexit. 

Fitch-rated structured finance (SF) transactions have significant rating 
headroom to absorb performance deterioration, and SF ratings are the least 
exposed in our scenarios. Ratings of credit-linked government related entities 
would move in line with the UK sovereign rating. 

Fitch's sector-by-sector analysis and scenarios can be found in our Special 
Report, ""No-Deal"" Brexit Rating Impact, published today and available at 
www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link above.

US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular

    In an interview with Reuters, Carlo Capuano, DBRS's
assistant vice president for global sovereign ratings, said it
was ""positive"" the government had lowered its original deficit

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday to clarify
whether he had told ministers that house prices in Britain could
slump by about a third if the country fails to secure a Brexit
deal.
    Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee in
Britain's parliament, made the request in a letter to Carney in
which she reiterated that the BoE should produce an analysis of
the impact of Brexit before any vote on parliament on a deal.
    Several British newspapers said last month that Carney told
ministers in a private meeting that mortgage rates could surge
and house prices fall by 35 percent over three years if there
was a chaotic no-deal Brexit.
    The BoE declined to comment on the reports at the time, and
Carney did not address them directly in a public appearance on
the day of their publication.
    The reports revived criticism of Carney from some Brexit
supporters who accused him of overstepping his remit when he
warned in 2016 that Britain's economy would be hit if voters
decided to leave the European Union.
    They were angered again by more recent comments from Carney
saying the economy would be damaged if there is no deal to
smooth Britain exit from the EU
    Morgan, who opposed Brexit before the referendum, said in
her letter to Carney that she wanted to know if Carney had been
referring to the extreme financial scenarios used last year by
the BoE for its tests of banks' financial health, or if he was
giving a more specific warning.
    The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said earlier on
Thursday that Carney's reported remarks had weighed on some of
its members' views about the outlook for the housing market.
[nU8N1E300A]
    ""If you have anything further to add, both about the content
and scope of your briefing, and the subsequent reporting of it,
I would be grateful if you could do so in your response to this
letter,"" Morgan asked Carney in her letter.
    The Treasury Committee has also asked Britain's finance
ministry and its Financial Conduct Authority regulator to assess
the impact of Brexit.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 11: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Insurer 
Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Achmea B.V.'s core operating entities at 
'A+' (Strong), and its Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Outlooks are 
Stable.

A full list of ratings is at the end of this commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The ratings reflect Achmea's very strong business profile and capitalisation, 
while profitability and debt servicing capabilities are rating weaknesses. 

Fitch's assessment of Achmea's business profile reflects the group's strong 
position in the Dutch insurance market, with leading positions in the health and 
non-life sectors. However, international diversification is limited. 
International activities accounted for only 6% of consolidated gross written 
premiums in 2017.

Fitch's assessment of capitalisation measured by Fitch's Prism Factor-Based 
model was 'Very Strong' at end-2017. The end-1H18 Solvency II coverage ratio of 
191% further supports our assessment of Achmea's capital strength. The 
Fitch-calculated financial leverage ratio (FLR) of 23% at end-2017 (2016: 24%) 
is moderate and expected to remain broadly stable. 

The group's financial performance is a key rating weakness, with net income 
return on equity (ROE) of 2.5% in 2017. Low profitability reflects Achmea's 
business mix as the leading Dutch health insurer. The Dutch basic health 
insurance segment is a low-margin and currently loss-making business. Fitch 
expects Achmea's ROE to stabilise in the 3%-5% range, supported by health and 
non-life premium increases and continued focus on cost reductions.

Similar to other Dutch health insurers, since 2014 Achmea has financed a pricing 
gap in its basic health insurance business, with premiums charged on basic 
health policies well below the cost of healthcare claims. We expect this gap to 
close gradually through premium increases as health insurers' capital buffers 
erode. This view is supported by a declining trend in Achmea's basic health 
price subsidy (2015: EUR481 million, 2016: EUR426 million, 2017: EUR108 
million). We expect the basic health segment to return to profitability by 2020.

Achmea realised more than half of its original EUR200 million cost-saving target 
(excluding one-offs) as of end-2017, and subsequently increased the target by 
EUR30 million to EUR230 million by end-2020. Cost savings are mainly being 
achieved through the reduction of the number of full-time employees, 
streamlining of IT systems and office space rationalisation.

Achmea's fixed charge coverage (FCC) ratio has been weak mainly due to its 
exposure to the low margin health insurance segment and occasional volatility in 
the non-life result. However, the FCC improved in 2017 and we expect it to 
stabilise in the 3x-5x range in the medium term.

Fitch views Achmea's investment strategy as conservative. Achmea had a low risky 
assets to equity ratio of 19% at end-2017, reflecting high quality bond and 
Dutch mortgage portfolios. In Fitch's view, Dutch residential mortgages do not 
adversely contribute to the group's overall credit risk, given the low 
historical loss rates, a creditor-friendly legal system, and national mortgage 
guarantee scheme backing qualifying loans. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The ratings could be downgraded if the group's net income ROE fails to improve 
above 3% on a sustainable basis.

The ratings could also be downgraded if the Prism FBM score falls below 'very 
strong' or financial leverage weakens to above 30% for a sustained period.

Significantly improved geographical diversification could lead to an upgrade, 
although this is not expected to happen in the near to medium term.

of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are 
available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's 
factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of 
relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its 
advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as 
audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, 
the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources 
with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the 
issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports 
should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any 
third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on 
in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the 
report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. 
This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or 
sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals 
identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible 
for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes 
only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute 
for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer 
and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be 
changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the 
adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular 
investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to 
any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 
(or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or 
dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to 
use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed 
under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act 
of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular 
jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and 
distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to 
three days earlier than to print subscribers.

    * No appetite to help a single country
    * Bending rules for Italy would damage ECB, sources say 
    * Sources highlight bank liquidity as flashpoint

    By Francesco Canepa
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank won't come to Italy's rescue if its governments or bank
sector run out of cash unless the country secures a bailout from
the European Union, five senior sources familiar with the ECB's
thinking told Reuters.
    Italy has seen its borrowing costs surge on financial
markets since its new government unveiled plans to increase its
budget deficit late last month, defying EU rules and reawakening
concerns about its huge pile of public debt.
    The sources, present an economic summit in Indonesia, said
Italy could still avoid a debt crisis if its government changed
course but should not count on the central bank to tame
investors or prop up its banks. 
    This is because EU rules do not allow the ECB to help a
country unless this has already agreed on a rescue ""programme"" -
political jargon for a bailout in exchange for belt-tightening
and painful economic reforms, an option the Italian government
has firmly rejected.
    Any attempt to circumvent those rules would damage the ECB's
credibility beyond repair and undermine acceptance of the
monetary union in creditor countries, such as Germany, the
sources said. 
    ""It’s a test-case to show Europe and its mechanisms work,""
said one of the sources on the sidelines of the International
Monetary Fund's annual meetings in the Indonesian resort town of
Nusa Dua.
    If Italy did secure a bailout, the ECB could then buy its
bonds on the market via Outright Monetary Transactions, a so far
unused policy tool unveiled in 2012 to quash speculation on a
euro break-up.
    An ECB spokesman declined to comment. 
    
    FLASHPOINT
    The sources warned that Italian banks, with 375 billion
euros ($435 billion) of domestic government debt on their
balance sheet, were the possible flashpoint.
    This is because they relied on those government bonds as
collateral to secure cash at the ECB, including some 250 billion
euros worth of long-term loans.
     If Italy, like Greece, were to lose its investment-grade
rating, the bonds that the banks used would become ineligible
for regular ECB lending, as well as for the ECB's bond-buying
stimulus programme.
    Banks that don't have alternative collateral of good quality
would then need to apply for a lifeline known as Emergency
Liquidity Assistance, supplied by the Bank of Italy.
    ""There are some banks that are actually in pretty good shape
so it wouldn’t be all of them (requesting ELA),"" another source
said.
    But even ELA could run into constraints after a while if
reliance on grew too high.
    As ELA can only be granted to solvent banks, the ECB's
Governing Council could require that an economic programme is in
place in Italy before it gives its all-clear to large amounts of
ECB cash being disbursed, much like it did in Greece.
    The ECB froze the amount of ELA available to Greek banks in
the summer of 2015 when Alexis Tsipras' leftist government
refused to agree to a bailout, leaving him with little choice
but to close the banks.
    ""We wouldn't want to give out cash to the banks only for it
to be taken abroad,"" a third source said. 
    Before that even happens, depositors and lenders would have
likely cut ties with Italian banks in anticipation of the
downgrade, triggering a liquidity crisis, the sources said.
    Italy's debt is rated two notches above junk by three of the
four ratings agencies recognised by the ECB, and three notches
above that key threshold by the remaining one, DBRS.
    Moody’s and S&P Global are due to provide an updated opinion
on Italy’s credit rating in the second half of October, with
analysts saying that around one downgrade is already priced in.

    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British police said on Thursday
they were still assessing whether to launch an investigation
into whether pro-Brexit  groups had committed criminal offences
during the campaign in the 2016 referendum on leaving the
European Union. 
    Britain’s electoral regulator has made two referrals to
police to look at potential offences committed over election

Brexit campaign group, Vote Leave.
    ""The first referral was received on May 11, 2018, and

    In July, Vote Leave was fined 61,000 pounds ($81,000) for
breaching spending rules by working with BeLeave in the
referendum which saw voters back Brexit by 52-48 percent.
[nL8N1UD11R]
    The commission said serious breaches of the law had been
committed by Vote Leave, which was fronted by leading Brexiteers
such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Michael Gove,
now environment minister. 
    Last month, London's High Court ruled that the Electoral
Commission had misinterpreted the spending law when it allowed
Vote Leave to donate to BeLeave, a smaller aligned group, during
the campaign. [nL5N1W02RD]

    * Italy seen as a test of ECB credibility-sources
    * No appetite to help a single country
    * Bending rules for Italy would damage ECB, sources say 
    * Sources highlight bank liquidity as flashpoint

    By Francesco Canepa
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank won't come to Italy's rescue if its governments or bank
sector run out of cash unless the country secures a bailout from
the European Union, five senior sources familiar with the ECB's
thinking told Reuters.
    Italy has seen its borrowing costs surge on financial
markets since its new government unveiled plans to increase its
budget deficit late last month, defying EU rules and reawakening
concerns about its huge pile of public debt.
    The sources, present an economic summit in Indonesia, said
Italy could still avoid a debt crisis if its government changed
course but should not count on the central bank to tame
investors or prop up its banks. 
    This is because EU rules do not allow the ECB to help a
country unless this has already agreed on a rescue ""programme"" -
political jargon for a bailout in exchange for belt-tightening
and painful economic reforms, an option the Italian government
has firmly rejected.
    Any attempt to circumvent those rules would damage the ECB's
credibility beyond repair and undermine acceptance of the
monetary union in creditor countries, such as Germany, the
sources said. 
    ""It’s a test-case to show Europe and its mechanisms work,""
said one of the sources on the sidelines of the International
Monetary Fund's annual meetings in the Indonesian resort town of
Nusa Dua.
    If Italy did secure a bailout, the ECB could then buy its
bonds on the market via Outright Monetary Transactions, a so far
unused policy tool unveiled in 2012 to quash speculation on a
euro break-up.
    An ECB spokesman declined to comment. 
    
    FLASHPOINT
    The sources warned that Italian banks, with 375 billion
euros ($435 billion) of domestic government debt on their
balance sheet, were the possible flashpoint.
    This is because they relied on those government bonds as
collateral to secure cash at the ECB, including some 250 billion
euros worth of long-term loans.
     If Italy, like Greece, were to lose its investment-grade
rating, the bonds that the banks used would become ineligible
for regular ECB lending, as well as for the ECB's bond-buying
stimulus programme.
    Banks that don't have alternative collateral of good quality
would then need to apply for a lifeline known as Emergency
Liquidity Assistance, supplied by the Bank of Italy.
    ""There are some banks that are actually in pretty good shape
so it wouldn’t be all of them (requesting ELA),"" another source
said.
    But even ELA could run into constraints after a while if
reliance on grew too high.
    As ELA can only be granted to solvent banks, the ECB's
Governing Council could require that an economic programme is in
place in Italy before it gives its all-clear to large amounts of
ECB cash being disbursed, much like it did in Greece.
    The ECB froze the amount of ELA available to Greek banks in
the summer of 2015 when Alexis Tsipras' leftist government
refused to agree to a bailout, leaving him with little choice
but to close the banks.
    ""We wouldn't want to give out cash to the banks only for it
to be taken abroad,"" a third source said. 
    Before that even happens, depositors and lenders would have
likely cut ties with Italian banks in anticipation of the
downgrade, triggering a liquidity crisis, the sources said.
    Italy's debt is rated two notches above junk by three of the
four ratings agencies recognised by the ECB, and three notches
above that key threshold by the remaining one, DBRS.
    Moody’s and S&P Global are due to provide an updated opinion
on Italy’s credit rating in the second half of October, with
analysts saying that around one downgrade is already priced in.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields were mostly
higher on Friday as a bounce in world stocks dented demand for
bond safe havens, although the equity rout still left German
bond yields on track for their first weekly fall in six weeks.
    The recovery in risk appetite globally leant some support to
a battered Italian debt market, where yields were 3 to 5 basis
points lower in early trade.
    European shares opened 1 percent higher <.STOXX>, tracking a
rise in Asian shares as equity markets recovered from this
week's rout.
    This biggest stock market shakeout since February has been
blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the
impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields and
caution ahead of earnings season.
    ""We're still left with the sense that there has been a
significant shift that markets now have to take stock of,"" said
Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital
Markets in London.
    Except for Italy, most bond yields in the euro zone were 1
to 3 bps higher on the day.
    Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up 2.5 basis points at 0.54
percent on Friday <DE10YT=RR>, but down from 4 1/2-month highs
reached earlier this week at 0.58 percent.
    It has fallen just over 2 bps this week, the first decline
in six weeks and the biggest drop in two months.
    For some analysts, the relatively small drop in German bond
yields was a sign of investor reluctance to buy fixed income.
    ""Ten-year German yields failed to close through 0.50 percent
in spite of the Italian budget turmoil at the start of the week,
and despite the global stocks meltdown,"" Mizuho analysts said in
a note. ""This shows the reluctance of investors to chase yields
lower, in our view.""
    Italy's bonds stabilised, with analysts saying a lot of
negative news has now been priced into the market. 
    Italian 10-year bond yields rose to 4 1/2-year highs earlier
this week on tension between Rome and the European Union over
Italy's expansionary budget plans.
    The Italian parliament voted on Thursday to push back the
goal of a balanced budget from 2020 to beyond 2021, reflecting
the government's new fiscal targets issued this month.
    On Friday, the International Monetary Fund said Italy needs
to respect EU budget rules and build a cash buffer to cushion
the next economic downturn [nB5N1SU00C].
    Portugal was also in focus amid expectations that ratings
agency Moody's would lift the country's rating by one notch to
investment grade later on Friday.

    By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
    BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China's vehicle sales slid 11.6
percent in September in their worst monthly drop in nearly seven
years, as slowing economic growth and a deepening Sino-U.S.
trade war took their toll on the world's largest auto market.
    Vehicle sales fell for the third straight month in September
to 2.39 million units, the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Friday, citing a sluggish economy,
deleveraging and a tough pollution crackdown for the steep fall.
    China's top auto industry body also said its already meagre
forecast for full-year growth would be missed, though the market
should avoid a sales decline. Analysts have predicted the market
could contract this year for the first time in decades.      
    The downtrend in sales underscores how international car
makers, from General Motors <GM.N> to Toyota Motor <7203.T>, are
in for a tough ride at a time when they are increasingly looking
towards China as a driver of growth. 
    It also exemplifies the impact of the trade war, with autos
being among the sectors hardest hit by tariffs. CAAM said last
month sales were impacted by a sluggish economy and the knock-on
effects of the trade war. [nL3N1VX2LM]
    China's economic malaise has seen the domestic stock markets
plunge and the country's factory sector stall last month after
over a year of expansion. The International Monetary Fund also
cut China's growth forecast for next year to 6.2 percent from
6.4 percent. [nL4N1WG01M][nL2N1WO1G3]
    Beijing, concerned about the slowdown, has already opened
the taps to boost liquidity in the market. [nL4N1WO023]
    The slide in September auto sales follows a 3.8 percent fall
in August and a 4.0 percent drop in July. Vehicle sales
increased 4.8 percent in June.
    September's drop was the most since a 26.4 percent tumble in
January 2012, which was in part due to the timing of the China
New Year holiday that year.
    Sales for the first nine months of the year totalled 20.49
million vehicles, up 1.5 percent from the same period a year
earlier.
    Xu Haidong, CAAM assistant secretary general, told a
briefing that 2018 sales growth would miss the association's
forecast of a 3 percent rise. Sales were up 3 percent last year,
but sharply down from a 13.7 percent gain in 2016.
    Amid the slowdown, an army of Chinese car dealers is feeling
the squeeze and is pushing for government support to revitalise
growth as concerns grow that the huge market could see its first
annual sales decline in decades. [nL4N1WP35Q]
    Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive
Foresight, said that if sales actually shrink this year it would
be a ""watershed moment"" for the industry.
    ""It's very alarming and is even causing panic among some
automakers and suppliers. That's because the market has been
growing non-stop every year for more than twenty years, and
those companies make plans based on growth,"" he said. 
    ""They don't know what to do and worry about survival.""  
      
    WINNERS AND LOSERS
    GM, one of the most successful global car makers in China
for decades, said earlier this month that September sales were
down a sharp 14.9 percent from a year earlier. German car maker
Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> said earlier this week that China
sales were down 10.5 percent last month. [nL4N1WO1KF]
    Ford Motor Co <F.N>, which has been struggling to turn
around falling sales in the market, said on Friday that
September sales in China were down 43 percent.
    China's broader economic woes have led to a particular
slowdown in the demand for cars in smaller, lower-tier cities
across China, some car makers have said, which until now were
the engine of growth for the country's auto industry.
    Zhang of Automotive Foresight said that several factors had
combined to cause this, including high gas prices this year
which had stymied growth in lower-tier cities.
    ""Small-tier market consumers buying cheaper cars are very
price sensitive and have begun delaying purchases. That's why
this is a big concern,"" he said.
    This pressure is now creating distinct winners and losers in
the market, a major shift from the golden years of growth where
most players were guaranteed decent returns.
    Among those struggling in China the most are Peugeot
<PEUP.PA>, Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> and its sister brand Kia
Motors <000270.KS>, Ford and Japanese car maker Honda Motor Co
Ltd <7267.T>.
    Sales of new-energy vehicles – a category comprising
electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles –
remained strong, up 54.8 percent in September, slightly faster
than a month earlier.
    That took new-energy vehicle sales in the first nine months
of this year to 721,000 vehicles, up 81.1 percent from the same
period a year earlier.
    The industry is also facing a shake-up as decades-old rules
change to allow foreign car makers to own majority stakes in
local joint ventures. Luxury German car maker BMW <BMWG.DE> said
on Thursday it would take control of its main China venture in a
$4.2 billion deal. [nL8N1WQ6P1]

    By Aaron Saldanha and Sruthi Shankar
    Oct 12 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks were on track to
snap a six-session losing run on Friday, while Turkey's lira
<TRY=> weakened ahead of a hearing for a detained U.S. pastor
which has strained the country's ties with Washington.  
    Solid gains in Taiwanese <.TWII>, Indian <.BSESN> and South
Korean shares <.KS11> helped drive MSCI's index of developing
world stocks <.MSCIEF> 2.2 percent higher, after Thursday's 3.2
percent fall, its biggest daily fall since a bout of market
turmoil around Britain's vote to leave the EU two years ago.
    Those moves tracked a general improvement in appetite for
risk among investors globally, with developed world stock
markets recovering after a dramatic two-day slide on Wall
Street.
    ""We're seeing a bit of a rebound in EM stock markets
today...we saw a similar occurrence earlier this year when U.S.
stocks came under pressure and that automatically improved, and
that might be what we're seeing this time around as well,"" said
Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital
Economics.
    The index was still on course to end lower for a third
straight week and has lost around $1 trillion in value this year
as rising U.S. interest rates, a strong dollar and an escalating
U.S.-China trade war bear down on sentiment. [nL8N1WS17C]
    Turkey's lira <TRY=> gave up early gains to weaken 0.4
percent ahead of another hearing in the trial of U.S. pastor
Andrew Brunson which has weighed on its ties with the United
States. U.S. media reports said his release had been agreed with
Ankara but the State Department said it was unaware of any such
deal. [nL8N1WR6D3]
    A rise in oil prices <LCOc1>, surging inflation and concerns
over the influence of President Tayyip Erdogan on monetary
policy have played into the lira sliding about 36 percent this
year.
    ""The release of Brunson might provide some short term
respite, even allowing the central bank to refrain from further
hiking its policy rates later this month,"" said Tim Ash, senior
EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management.
    ""But unless we see much better focus and coordination
between (Finance Minister Berat) Albayrak's team and those in
the advisory team around the president, muddle through will
likely fail and still end up with Turkey going to the IMF."" 
    South Africa's rand <ZAR=> sailed 1.1 percent higher and
bond yields across two to ten-year maturities dipped ahead of a
Moody's ratings decision. Markets widely expect the ratings
agency to keep the rating unchanged and await the mid-term
budget to be delivered by new Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on
Oct. 26.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro zone's
continuing expansion has vindicated European Central Bank policy
but risks to the outlook, from trade protectionism to the threat
of a hard Brexit, are on the rise, ECB President Mario Draghi
said on Friday.
    The ECB has been dialling back stimulus for months and
expects to end a 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase scheme in
December, arguing that it has done enough to sustain growth and
the rebound in inflation.
    But Draghi also toned down earlier remarks, which
foreshadowed a ""relatively vigorous"" rise in underlying
inflation, merely predicting a ""gradual"" increase over the
medium term. 
    ""Recent developments vindicate the Governing Council’s
earlier assessments of the medium-term inflation outlook,""
Draghi said at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting.
""Uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding.""
    In a potential reference to the rise in Italian yields,
Draghi also played down concerns about recent market volatility,
suggesting that this has not had a broader impact.
    ""With respect to financial stability more broadly, recent
episodes of heightened financial market volatility have led to
only limited contagion across countries and markets,"" Draghi
told the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee in
Bali.
    Still, he warned of increasingly prominent external risks,
which would impact euro zone growth.
    ""An orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the
European Union poses a limited overall risk to the euro area’s
financial stability,"" Draghi said.
    ""However, the uncertainty triggered by a cliff-edge Brexit
could have the potential to pose a more significant downside
risk to financial stability,"" he added.

    By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - UK shares staged a modest
recovery on Friday after a broad sell-off and a burst of
volatility hit stock markets across the globe, amid worries
about protectionism and fast-rising U.S. interest rates.
    The FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, down about 6 percent since the
beginning of October, was up 0.6 percent by 0835 GMT but still
trading at levels not seen since last April. A number of
European benchmarks suffered heavier losses from the biggest
market shakeout since February.
    ""As far as U.K. markets are concerned, we appear to have
stabilised well above the lows of the year, unlike the German
DAX, which fell to its lowest levels since the end of December
2016 yesterday before rebounding"", Michael Hewson, an analyst at
 CMC Markets, told his clients. 
    Tobacco stocks Imperial Brands <IMB.L> and British American
Tobacco <BATS.L> were the biggest drag on the index, down after
reports of possible further restriction on vaping products. 
    ""Over the last few years, my weighting towards tobacco has
only gone down. I'm trying to quit but I still have an
investment"", said Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton in
London. 
    Ashmore <ASHM.L> rose 1.5 percent after the emerging-
markets-focused fund manager said assets under management rose 3
percent in its first quarter, boosted by inflows of client cash,
market gains and acquired assets. 
    British hedge fund Man Group's <EMG.L> rose 1.9 percent
after it reported that funds under management rose 0.4 percent
in the third quarter. 
    Sports Direct <SPD.L> the sportswear group controlled by
retail tycoon Mike Ashley, rose 1.5 percent after its agreed to
buy the freehold of the Frasers department store in Glasgow for
95 million pounds ($125.7 million), it said on Friday.
    Shares in Patisserie Holdings <CAKEP.L> which warned on
Thursday that it was in danger of collapse if it could not raise
capital, were suspended. 
    Finance director Chris Marsh was arrested by the police on
Thursday night and had been released on bail [nL4N1WS3DN].

be mindful of financial stability risks, including those created
by its own ultra easy policy, ECB board member Sabine
Lautenschlaeger said on Friday, weighing in on a recent debate.
    ""The ECB cannot and should not turn a blind eye to risks to
financial stability,"" Lautenschlaeger said in Malta. ""Without
financial stability, it becomes quite hard to ensure price
stability.""
    Policymakers have recently debated what role the ECB should
have in maintaining stability with some arguing for broader
responsibility and others making the case that it should focus
on inflation only and leave stability to political authorities.
    Lautenschlaeger warned that the ECB's own bond purchases,
due to end in December, could also increase stability risk by
reducing liquidity and distorting asset prices while its low
rates could fuel asset price bubbles.

    MILAN, Oct 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The radical
government wants the finance ministry and local railways to
support a 2 bln euro rescue for the ailing airline. State
involvement may scare off potential international partners and
make it harder to cut costs. Taxpayers would once again bear the
costs of failure.
       
    Full view will be published shortly.
    On Twitter https://twitter.com/LJucca
    
    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The Italian government is working on a plan to rescue
Alitalia that will see it own around 15 percent of the
loss-making airline, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said in
an interview with Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore published on Oct.
12.
    - The plan envisages injecting between 1.5 billion and 2
billion euros of capital into a new company, stripped of bad
assets, in partnership with state-controlled railway operator
Ferrovie dello Stato. Di Maio added that one or more
international partners would also be investors, without
elaborating.
    - Di Maio said that state-backed investment operator Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti could also be involved and help fund the
acquisition or lease a new fleet. The minister said that if
state-controlled companies like oil major Eni, the Post Office
and defence company Leonardo wanted to give a hand, this ""would
be interesting"".
    - A deadline for binding offers has been set for the end of
October, Di Maio added.
    - Alitalia was placed under special administration last year
and subsequently put up for sale. The government has lent it 900
million euros to keep it afloat during the sale process,
which was initially due to take six months.
    - The European Commission said in April the government’s
loan to Alitalia may constitute state aid.

 (Adds quote from CAAM official)
    By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
    BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China's car sales fell the most
in nearly seven years in September, stoking concerns the world's
biggest auto market could contract for the first time in decades
this year amid cooling economic growth and a biting trade war.
    Vehicle sales slumped by 11.6 percent to 2.39 million units
last month, the third straight decline, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Friday. It cited a
sluggish economy, deleveraging and a tough pollution crackdown
as reasons for the steep fall.
    A stalling of China's giant auto sector will be a concern
for the country's leaders in Beijing. It is a major driver of
the economy and an important barometer of Chinese consumers'
willingness to open their purse strings.
    ""The automotive industry has been a driver of China's
economic growth for years. Now it is pulling back,"" Xu Haidong,
CAAM assistant secretary general, said at a briefing in Beijing.
    China's top auto industry body said its already meagre
forecast for full-year growth would be missed, though the market
should avoid a sales decline. Analysts have predicted the market
could contract this year for the first time since at least the
early 1990s.
    The downtrend in sales underscores how international car
makers, from General Motors <GM.N> to Toyota Motor <7203.T>, are
in for a tough ride at a time when they are increasingly looking
towards China as a driver of growth. 
    It also exemplifies the impact of the trade war, with autos
being among the sectors hardest hit by tariffs. CAAM said last
month sales were impacted by a sluggish economy and the knock-on
effects of the trade war. [nL3N1VX2LM]
    China's economic malaise has seen the domestic stock markets
plunge and the country's factory sector stall last month after
over a year of expansion. The International Monetary Fund also
cut China's growth forecast for next year to 6.2 percent from
6.4 percent. [nL4N1WG01M][nL2N1WO1G3]
    Beijing, concerned about the slowdown, has already opened
the taps to boost liquidity in the market. [nL4N1WO023]
    The slide in September auto sales follows a 3.8 percent fall
in August and a 4.0 percent drop in July. Vehicle sales
increased 4.8 percent in June.
    September's drop was the most since a 26.4 percent tumble in
January 2012, which was in part due to the timing of the China
New Year holiday that year.
    Sales for the first nine months of the year totalled 20.49
million vehicles, up 1.5 percent from the same period a year
earlier.
    CAAM's Xu said that 2018 sales growth would miss the
association's previous forecast of a 3 percent rise. Sales were
also up 3 percent last year, but sharply down from a 13.7
percent gain in 2016.
    Amid the slowdown, an army of Chinese car dealers is feeling
the squeeze and is pushing for government support to revitalise
growth. [nL4N1WP35Q]
    Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive
Foresight, said that if sales actually shrink this year it would
be a ""watershed moment"" for the industry.
    ""It's very alarming and is even causing panic among some
automakers and suppliers. That's because the market has been
growing non-stop every year for more than twenty years, and
those companies make plans based on growth,"" he said. 
    ""They don't know what to do and worry about survival.""  
    
    WINNERS AND LOSERS
    GM, one of the most successful global car makers in China
for decades, said earlier this month that September sales were
down a sharp 14.9 percent from a year earlier. German car maker
Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> said earlier this week that China
sales were down 10.5 percent last month. [nL4N1WO1KF]
    Ford Motor Co <F.N>, which has been struggling to turn
around falling sales in the market, said on Friday that
September sales in China were down 43 percent.
    China's broader economic woes have led to a particular
slowdown in the demand for cars in smaller, lower-tier cities
across China, some car makers have said, which until now were
the engine of growth for the country's auto industry.
    Zhang of Automotive Foresight said that several factors had
combined to cause this, including high gas prices this year
which had stymied growth in lower-tier cities.
    The industry is also facing a shake-up as decades-old rules
change to allow foreign car makers to own majority stakes in
local joint ventures. Luxury German car maker BMW <BMWG.DE> said
on Thursday it would take control of its main China venture in a
$4.2 billion deal. [nL8N1WQ6P1]
    The changing auto landscape is throwing up distinct winners
and losers in the market, a major shift from the golden years of
growth where most players were guaranteed decent returns.
    Among those struggling in China the most are Peugeot
<PEUP.PA>, Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> and its sister brand Kia
Motors <000270.KS>, Ford and Japanese car maker Honda Motor Co
Ltd <7267.T>.
    Sales of new-energy vehicles – a category comprising
electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles –
remained strong, up 54.8 percent in September, slightly faster
than a month earlier.
    That took new-energy vehicle sales in the first nine months
of this year to 721,000 vehicles, up 81.1 percent from the same
period a year earlier.

 (Updates with Draghi comments,)
    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - German government bonds were set
for their best week since August on Friday thanks to the
equities rout, with dovish comments on the inflation outlook
from ECB chief Mario Draghi supporting broader euro zone debt
markets.
    Draghi said on Friday that underlying inflation in the bloc
will rise gradually, toning down earlier remarks which
foreshadowed a ""relatively vigorous"" rise. [nF9N1U500I]
    Having risen in early trade in response to a firmer tone in
world stock markets, most yields in the euro zone crept back
down to stand little changed on the day. 
    In Germany, the bloc's benchmark bond issuer, 10-year yields
were marginally higher at 0.52 percent <DE10YT=RR> and below
4-1/2-month highs reached earlier this week at 0.58 percent.
    They are down about 4 bps this week, the first decline in
six weeks and the biggest drop in two months.
    While world stocks recovered some ground on Friday after
this week's rout, sentiment remained fragile. European shares
were last up 0.5 percent <.STOXX> and off their highs.
    This biggest stock market shakeout since February has been
blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the
impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields and
caution before the earnings season.
    ""We're still left with the sense that there has been a
significant shift that markets now have to take stock of,"" said
Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital
Markets in London.
    For some analysts, the relatively small fall in German bond
yields was a sign of investor reluctance to buy fixed income.
    ""Ten-year German yields failed to close through 0.50 percent
in spite of the Italian budget turmoil at the start of the week,
and despite the global stocks meltdown,"" Mizuho analysts said in
a note.
    Italy's bonds stabilised <IT2YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR>, with yields
edging 2-3 bps lower as risk appetite recovered. Analysts said a
lot of negative news has now been priced into the market. 
    Italian 10-year bond yields rose to 4 1/2-year highs earlier
this week on tension between Rome and the European Union over
the government's expansionary budget plans.
    The International Monetary Fund said on Friday Italy needs
to respect EU budget rules and build a cash buffer for the next
economic downturn [nB5N1SU00C].
    Portugal was also in focus amid expectations that ratings
agency Moody's would lift its rating by one notch later on
Friday.
    ""It's our base case that Portugal will be upgraded to
investment grade, it is overdue,"" said Michael Leister, rates
strategist at Commerzbank.
    Sunday's election in the German state of Bavaria was also in
focus. Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies are heading
for their worst showing in a state election in over 60 years, a
setback that risks widening divisions within her crisis-prone
national government. [nL8N1WQ3QW]

    By Costas Pitas and Andrew MacAskill
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May was struggling on Friday to find consensus on Brexit
proposals that would be acceptable to her ministers, her
Conservative Party and the Northern Irish lawmakers who prop up
her minority government. 
    Brexit negotiations with the European Union have accelerated
and become more positive over the past week, though significant
hurdles remain, finance minister Philip Hammond said.
    ""What has happened over the last week, 10 days, is that
there has been a measurable change in pace,"" he told the BBC. 
    ""But that shouldn't conceal the fact that we still have some
big differences left to resolve,"" Hammond said. ""So process is a
lot more positive this week - substance still very challenging.""
    With less than six months to go until the United Kingdom is
due to leave the EU, May is seeking to rally support at home on
the details of a divorce deal though it is unclear if she can
win parliament's approval for any agreement.
    British and EU negotiators are making headway on the Irish
border issue, the biggest hurdle to an overall agreement, and
hope for a Brexit deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said.
[nL8N1WR36O]
    The Irish border ""backstop"", which seeks a way to avoid
customs checks on the frontier between the British province of 
Northern Ireland and Ireland if there is no overall exit deal,
has become the biggest sticking point in negotiations.
    As both sides seek to clinch a deal, the United Kingdom will
publish on Friday more of its so-called technical notices which
lay out the impact of a no-deal Brexit on specific sectors of
the economy. [nL8N1WA4KA]
    
    DEAL OR NO-DEAL?
    May's Northern Irish supporters vehemently oppose any checks
between the province and mainland Britain after Brexit.
    The head of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster,
said May ""could not in good conscience"" back an EU proposal for
checks on goods being imported to Northern Ireland from Britain
after Brexit.
    Under May's proposals, the whole of the United Kingdom would
forge a customs partnership with the EU after a transition
period ends in December 2020 in the event of the backstop being
triggered.
    Some of May's ministers have urged her to put a time limit
on that plan. 
    Britain's international trade, environment and Brexit
ministers told May at a meeting on Thursday that they fear the
whole of Britain could remain in the EU customs union for an
open-ended period, the BBC said.
    May will never agree to a backstop plan that means Britain
could be permanently tied to the bloc's customs rules, her
spokeswoman said on Friday. ""The prime minister would never
agree to a deal which could trap the UK in a backstop
permanently,"" she said.
    The Times newspaper reported May was warned the issue was so
serious that she could face further cabinet resignations unless
she found a way to ensure the backstop was not permanent. 
    Speaking to Northern Ireland journalists at her Downing
Street office, May said on Thursday that talks on the Irish
backstop were likely to continue until November.

    By Paul Carrel and Alexander Hübner
    BERLIN/MUNICH, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Munich-based German
aircraft engine maker MTU Aero Engines <MTXGn.DE> has warned its
employees against populism before a regional election in
Bavaria, and consultants EY have issued their local staff with
similar guidance.
    Though neither company mentioned the anti-immigration
Alternative for Germany (AfD) in their internal memoranda, the
messages highlight corporate concerns about the rise of the
far-right and perceived threats to German political stability.
    The AfD, which has campaigned in Bavaria with the slogan
""our state, our homeland"", is poised to surge into the regional
assembly in Bavaria for the first time after Sunday's vote.
    MTU told employees in a letter: ""Populist slogans don't take
our country forward, but rather targeted government action on
the basis of our core values.""
    ""Germany, and especially a strategically-orientated industry
like ours, relies on stable political conditions,"" MTU directors
added in the letter, which was posted on the company's intranet
and a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
    The directors stressed they were not advising their
employees which party to back, but urged them to vote
""responsibly"". Around half of MTU's 10,000 workers are based in
Bavaria.
    The AfD has established itself across Germany with
anti-Islamic rhetoric and attacks on Chancellor Angela Merkel's
migrant policy. This is a particularly hot topic in Bavaria,
where most of the 1.5 million asylum seekers who have reached
Germany in the past three years entered the country.
    The AfD's rise has eroded support for Merkel's allies in
Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU), who are set to lose
the absolute majority with which they have controlled the
southern state for most of the post-war period.
    In Bavaria, support for the AfD - with whom the CSU has
ruled out an alliance - stands at 10-14 percent, surveys show.
    After the Bavarian vote, the AfD is set to have seats in 15
of Germany's 16 state assemblies and it is likely to enter the
remaining one, Hesse, after a state election there on Oct. 28.
    In an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by
Reuters, EY's Munich-based managing director in Germany, Hubert
Barth, wrote: ""Today, our liberal democracy is once again
exposed to major attacks at home and from abroad.""
    Referring to the ""landmark"" elections in Bavaria and Hesse -
home to the financial centre of Frankfurt - Barth added: ""Our
democracy is an important part of our economic success.""
    ""I call on all colleagues to exercise their right to vote in
order to strengthen the democratic and constitutional forces in
our country,"" Barth concluded in his email, which was headed ""a
political statement"".
    The expected setback for the CSU risks widening divisions
within Germany's crisis-prone national government, which depends
on support from the Bavarian party.

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Luxembourg may revert to
political tradition on Sunday if an election confirms opinion
polls showing a resurgence for its long-dominant centre-right
party at the expense of the liberal-led coalition.
    Surveys indicate the Christian Social People's Party (CSV),
led for decades by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and by
far the biggest single group, will end Xavier Bettel's five-year
term as only the second non-CSV leader since World War Two.
    The conservatives, however, may lack an outright majority 
in the 60-seat chamber after a campaign focused on local issues,
notably housing. If so, leader Claude Wiseler could try to renew
Juncker's pre-2013 coalition with Etienne Schneider's Socialist
Workers' Party (LSAP), Bettel's Democratic Party or with Greens.
    These three parties seized on a surprise setback for Juncker
when he called a snap election after a wiretapping scandal to
form a three-way coalition in the Grand Duchy under Bettel that
froze the CSV out of power for the first time since the war.
    That ended Juncker's 20 years as prime minister and saw him
move to Brussels the following year as president of the European
Commission, the European Union's executive arm.
    However, external policy for the EU's second-smallest state
is unlikely to change much. Successive governments have defended
a 40-year-old economic model based on financial services and low
corporate taxation. 
    To avoid isolation in the EU, Luxembourg has been adapting
its long-term economic plan under pressure from bigger
neighbours who have branded it a tax haven and a
money-laundering hub.
    Also the wealthiest country in the bloc, Luxembourg has seen
little of the controversies over immigration that have boosted
far-right parties' popularity ahead of May's elections to the
European Parliament, although in 2015 Luxembourg's 250,000 
electors decisively rejected giving the vote to the 48 percent
of the population who are foreign, mostly from other EU states.

    By Costas Pitas and Andrew MacAskill
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May was struggling on Friday to find consensus on Brexit
proposals that would be acceptable to her ministers, her
Conservative Party and the Northern Irish lawmakers who prop up
her minority government. 
    Brexit negotiations with the European Union have accelerated
and become more positive over the past week, though significant
hurdles remain, finance minister Philip Hammond said.
    ""What has happened over the last week, 10 days, is that
there has been a measurable change in pace,"" he told the BBC. 
    ""But that shouldn't conceal the fact that we still have some
big differences left to resolve,"" Hammond said. ""So process is a
lot more positive this week - substance still very challenging.""
    With less than six months to go until the United Kingdom is
due to leave the EU, May is seeking to rally support at home on
the details of a divorce deal though it is unclear if she can
win parliament's approval for any agreement.
    Britain warned on Friday that leaving the EU without a
divorce deal would mean drugmakers needing to stockpile
experimental treatments from remaining member states in case of
border delays. Professional qualifications from European nations
may no longer be recognised in Britain, it added.
    The government, which has warned of a no-deal Brexit,
published more than 25 technical notices covering issues from
consumer rights and sanctions policy to rail transport and
taking horses abroad.
    But British and EU negotiators are making headway on the
Irish border issue, the biggest hurdle to an overall agreement,
and hope for a Brexit deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats
said. [nL8N1WR36O]
    The Irish border ""backstop"", which seeks a way to avoid
customs checks on the frontier between the British province of 
Northern Ireland and Ireland if there is no overall exit deal,
has become the biggest sticking point in negotiations.
 
    DEAL OR NO DEAL?
    May's Northern Irish supporters vehemently oppose any checks
between the province and mainland Britain after Brexit.
    The head of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster,
said May ""could not in good conscience"" back an EU proposal for
checks on goods being imported to Northern Ireland from Britain
after Brexit.
    Under May's proposals, the whole of the United Kingdom would
forge a customs partnership with the EU after a transition
period ends in December 2020 in the event of the backstop being
triggered.
    Some of May's ministers have urged her to put a time limit
on that plan. 
    Britain's international trade, environment and Brexit
ministers told May at a meeting on Thursday that they fear the
whole of Britain could remain in the EU customs union for an
open-ended period, the BBC said.
    May will never agree to a backstop plan that means Britain
could be permanently tied to the bloc's customs rules, her
spokeswoman said on Friday. ""The prime minister would never
agree to a deal which could trap the UK in a backstop
permanently,"" she said.
    The Times newspaper reported May was warned the issue was so
serious that she could face further cabinet resignations unless
she found a way to ensure the backstop was not permanent. 
    Speaking to Northern Ireland journalists at her Downing
Street office, May said on Thursday that talks on the Irish
backstop were likely to continue until November.
    In the worse case scenario of Britain failing to agree a
divorce deal, the government warned that the single electricity
market shared between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic
may not continue. Consumers may also no longer enjoy the
protections they are used to when buying goods and services in
the EU, it added.
    However, the government said it was working hard to mitigate
such risks.
    Britain will continue to enforce EU economic sanctions in
force when it leaves the bloc on March 29, even if it does not
secure an exit deal.
    Brexit supporters accept there is likely to be some
short-term economic pain but say the government is trying to
scare voters about the impact of a no-deal exit.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Brussels, the political heart
of Europe, could prove the centre of global market focus next
week as Italy's budget and Brexit talks overshadow economic data
and central banks.
    World shares were on course for their worst week since
February as a spike in U.S. bond yields, a U.S.-China trade war
and other global risks have combined to undermine sentiment.
    One such risk is an impending dispute between Italy's
eurosceptic government and the European Union over Rome's 2019
budget plans, which could lead the EU executive to the
unprecedented move of rejecting it.
    Euro zone countries, including Italy, have until Monday to
submit their draft budgetary plans to the European Commission,
winch which would have to warn Rome within a week if it planned
to trigger the rejection process. [nL8N1WR2UJ]
    The populist Italian government plans a deficit of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's
target, prompting investors to sell Italian bonds and pushing
the country's borrowing costs to five-year high at a bond
auction. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    EU leaders meeting in Brussels from Wednesday to Friday are
expected to spend time discussing Italy, even if it is not
formally on the agenda of an exceptional three days of talks
that will also see them meeting around 25 Asian leaders,
including the prime ministers of China and Japan.
    That agenda does include efforts to finalise a withdrawal
deal with Britain.
    Finding a way of ensuring an open border between Ireland and
Northern Ireland post-Brexit has been the main challenge, but
the indications in the past two weeks are that both sides are
inching towards a deal, boosting the pound.
    ""Now comes the crunch time,"" said economists at Commerzbank,
adding that there was the risk of a sharp correction if
negotiations drag on beyond the coming week.
    James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said
Italy's budget and Brexit would be in sharp focus in the week
ahead, along with the course of markets themselves.
    ""Are we going to get any calm returning to equity markets?
There's a lot of unsettling concern about the combination of
higher bond yields, geopolitical risk and the ongoing trade
tensions,"" he said.
    
    FED ON TRACK DESPITE TRUMP INVECTIVE
    In terms of data, September retail sales from the United
States are expected to reflect the strength of the world's
largest economy with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, a
49-year low, and wages picking up.
    The sales figures on Monay are seen up 0.5 percent in after
a mere 0.1 percent increase in August, the smallest rise in six
months.
    Such data should confirm the Federal Reserve in its
rate-cutting path, even if U.S. President Donald Trump has
called it crazy. The Fed increased interest rates for a third
time this year at the end of September and is expected to do so
again.
    ""That's going to be keeping the Fed on a rates-hiking and
tightening path, even though there is some concern in financial
markets right now,"" said Knightley.
    The week is set to round off with figures on Chinese
economic growth on Friday. The average forecast for expansion in
the third quarter is 6.6 percent, a shade lower than the 6.7
percent growth in the April-June period. 
    Anything lower than that could indicate that the trade war
with Washington, as well as a slowing property market, could be
dragging down the world's second-largest economy.
    Trade figures from China on Friday showed China's trade
surplus with the United States hit a record high in September.
    The data showed solid expansion in China's overall imports
and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat
tariffs with the United States, though that could provoke a
reaction from Trump. [nL4N1WP28H]

    BULLS TRY TO TAKE BACK CONTROL (0915 AM EDT/1315 GMT)    
    With stock futures pointing to a higher open, bulls appear
to be reasserting themselves. Indeed, action coming at an
opportune time for the beleaguered NYSE Composite <.NYA>. (Click
on chart below)
    The NYA, of course, was one index that was unable to surpass
its January peak. In fact it topped in September right at the
76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of its January/February
slide.
    It has since, collapsed, and at the depths of Thursday's
market swoon, it was down close to 10 percent from its record
high.
    However, with a small rebound into the close, the index
managed to hold the channel support line from its February
trough. This just as the NYSE McClellan Oscillator (McSUM)
<.AD.N>, a breadth/momentum measure, was testing its February
low. (Refinitiv data) With the McSum having reached fertile
ground for a reversal, the NYA is indeed poised to rally.
    However, with the February/September recovery still looking
like a protracted counter-trend bounce (Elliott Wave basis),
whatever strength now develops has a lot of work to do to prove
it isn't just another modest pause in a developing bear trend,
that will ultimately take out the February trough.
    NYA faces shorter-term Fibonacci hurdles in the
12,573/12,741 area. These ahead of 12,913/13,066 swing levels.

 Reuters Hungary GDP forecasts

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank (NBH) is
expected to keep Central Europe's lowest interest rates on hold
at its meeting on Oct. 16 and for the rest of 2018, not worried
by a rise in inflation, a survey of analysts showed.
    In the Oct. 8-11 poll, 16 analysts unanimously forecast that
the bank would keep its record-low 0.9 percent base rate
unchanged on Tuesday.
    None of the participants projected a change in the -0.15
percent overnight deposit rate, either, and all of the forecasts
were for no change in either rate this year.
    The bank revamped its policy tools last month to prepare for
policy normalisation if inflation trends justify. But it stopped
short of hinting at an upcoming change in monetary conditions
[nL8N1W459U].
    Annual headline inflation picked up to 3.6 percent in
September from 3.4 percent in August [nB3N1TG02O].
    That is the highest rate since January 2013, but still
within the NBH's 2 to 4 percent target range, and core inflation
excluding volatile food and energy items remained lower, at 2.4
percent.
    In an article published after the September figures, NBH
economists Pal Kolozsi and Mihaly Hoffmann said inflation trends
did not justify changing the direction of monetary policy
[nL8N1WP28M].
    Analysts have said inflation could stay above 3 percent in
the next months. Hungary's real interest rate, the premium over
inflation, is the lowest in the region.
    In the poll, annual average inflation is forecast at 2.9
percent for this year, 3.3 percent for next year and 3.1 percent
in 2020.
    Even though those figures are within the target range, NBH
rate setters also need to watch the central bankers in the
United States, the euro zone and the region.
    A rise in interest rates elsewhere can weaken the forint if
Hungarian interest rates stay low, which can generate additional
inflation and in turn more forint weakness. 
    Fears of that vicious circle was demonstrated by a plunge of
the currency to record lows against the euro three months ago as
a rally of the dollar caused currency selling in emerging
markets, while inflation worry added to pressure on the forint.
    ""The timing of the start of rate tightening will hinge on
the forint,"" said Gergely Szabo Forian, Chief Investment Officer
at Amundi's Budapest-based unit. 
    In Central Europe, the Czech and the Romanian central banks
have already followed the Federal Reserve's example and raised
rates.    
    The poll showed that the NBH is expected to join the pack
around the time when the European Central Bank is seen starting
to normalise its own interest rates in the autumn of next year.
    The bank is expected to allow liquidity in domestic markets
to tighten gradually even before that.
    However, some analysts have warned that the NBH may fall
behind the curve if inflation accelerates faster than currently
expected or a new round of emerging-market sell-offs spills over
into central Europe, driving up risk premiums on local assets.
    ""Short-term interest rates offer a terribly low real
interest and the market considers this unsustainable,"" Szabo
Forian said. The spread between three-month and 10-year
Hungarian yields has widened to at least 14-year highs over the
past months.
    The survey saw the three-month interbank BUBOR rate <BUBOR=>
rising to 0.6 percent over the next one year from Friday's 0.7
percent.
    The overnight deposit rate is expected to rise to zero by
the end of 2019 from -0.15 percent and to 0.5 percent in 2020.
    Some analysts also expect the base rate to start to rise
from 0.9 percent next year, but their median forecasts show an
unchanged rate for the end of 2019, before a rise to 1.5 percent
in 2020.

    BULLS TRY TO TAKE BACK CONTROL (0915 AM EDT/1315 GMT)    
    With stock futures pointing to a higher open, bulls appear
to be reasserting themselves. Indeed, action coming at an
opportune time for the beleaguered NYSE Composite <.NYA>. (Click
on chart below)
    The NYA, of course, was one index that was unable to surpass
its January peak. In fact it topped in September right at the
76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of its January/February
slide.
    It has since, collapsed, and at the depths of Thursday's
market swoon, it was down close to 10 percent from its record
high.
    However, with a small rebound into the close, the index
managed to hold the channel support line from its February
trough. This just as the NYSE McClellan Oscillator (McOsc)
<.AD.N>, a breadth/momentum measure, was testing its February
low. (Refinitiv data) With the McOsc having reached fertile
ground for a reversal, the NYA is indeed poised to rally.
    However, with the February/September recovery still looking
like a protracted counter-trend bounce (Elliott Wave basis),
whatever strength now develops has a lot of work to do to prove
it isn't just another modest pause in a developing bear trend,
that will ultimately take out the February trough.
    NYA faces shorter-term Fibonacci hurdles in the
12,573/12,741 area. These ahead of 12,913/13,066 swing levels.

    U.S. STOCK FUTURES POINT TO BOUNCE AFTER SELLOFF (0847 AM
EDT/1247 GMT) 
    Equities were poised to bounce at the open on Friday as
stocks attempt to stabilize after a selloff that has sent the
S&P <.SPX> down 5.5 percent this week, putting it on pace for
its worst weekly performance since late March. 
    Banks are in focus as earnings season gets underway, with
Citigroup <C.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all
higher premarket after posting results and supporting gains.
[nL4N1WS4F8][nL4N1WS456][nL4N1WS4GE]
    Data showed U.S. import prices jumped faster than expected
in September amid resurgent energy prices but prices excluding
fuels were unchanged. Shortly after the open, preliminary
consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan is
scheduled to be released. 
    
 
 
 
    Earnings will be in focus as Q3 results begin to flow, with
investors keeping close tabs on corporate outlooks for any
impact of trade battles. Recent warnings from names such as PPG
Industries <PPG.N> and Fastenal <FAST.O> have helped unnerve
investors this week. 
    European indices are bouncing after sharp selloffs earlier
this week, although Europe was on track for its worst week since
February. Asian shares also closed higher.

 (Adds comments on nickel, updates prices)
    By Eric Onstad
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Aluminium rebounded on Friday,
breaking a six-session losing streak, as speculators and
consumers regarded the lower prices as good value against a
background of recovering share markets.
    The metal touched a two-week low on Thursday amid a broad
sell-off sparked by a global rout in equities.
    But global shares were having their best day in nearly a
month on Friday as European and Asian markets recovered.
[nL8N1WS1MF]
    ""Asia equity markets strengthened last night and then Europe
followed as well, so that is being poured into the metals space
and we're seeing some technical, momentum buying,"" said Geordie
Wilkes, head of research at Sucden Financial in London.
    ""It looks as though some of these CTA (Commodity Trading
Advisor) funds have seen some of these technical levels hold and
come into the market.""
    Aluminium hit a 3-1/2-month peak of $2,267 on Oct. 4 due to
fears of alumina shortages, but when those worries subsided,
prices gave up 11 percent.
    The market hit a low of $2,017.50 on Thursday, holding above
a band of support that has kicked in during the past few months,
with consumers also on the buying side, traders said.
    London Metal Exchange three-month aluminium <CMAL3> was up
1.8 percent at $2,057 a tonne by 1400 GMT. Prices were on course
for a loss of nearly 4 percent this week, extending 2018's drop
to 11 percent. 

    * COPPER IMPORTS: Copper prices were supported after data
showed China's unwrought copper imports surged to their highest
in 2-1/2 years in September, while copper concentrate imports
climbed to an all-time high. [nL4N1WS21O]
    LME copper <CMCU3> climbed 1.1 percent to $6,311 a tonne
after closing flat in the previous session. It was set to log a
2 percent gain for the week. 
    * ZINC STOCKS: Zinc inventories in warehouses monitored by
the Shanghai Futures Exchange surged 48.5 percent over the past
two weeks to 43,373 tonnes, data showed on Friday. [nENNIA90T2]
    LME zinc prices <CMZN3>, however, seemed to shrug off those
potentially bearish signals, rising 1.7 percent to $2,649 a
tonne.
    * CHINESE EXPORTS: Helping to cap gains in metals prices was
data showing an unexpected acceleration in Chinese export growth
in September and a record trade surplus with the United States,
which could exacerbate an already-heated dispute between Beijing
and Washington. [nL4N1WP28H]
    * NICKEL: Nickel <CMNI3> added 0.8 percent to $12,780 a
tonne. ""The market has been capped into the $13,000 area this
week with Chinese selling evident. A break above there would
open up potential for $13,300,"" Alastair Munro at broker Marex
Spectron said in a note.
    * PRICES: Lead <CMPB3> was the best performer, climbing 2.7
percent to $2,052, while tin <CMSN3> shed 0.8 percent to
$19,120.

a punishing selloff that sent the S&P 500 <.SPX> down nearly 7
percent from its September 20 high. 
    Tech <.SPLRCT>, one of the primary culprits of the downturn,
is helping fuel the rebound today as it is on track for its
biggest daily percentage gain since late March. 
    Still, equities had fallen from their initial highs that
sent the benchmark S&P index briefly back above its 200-day
moving average as banks lost their premarket steam in the wake
of earnings from Citigroup <C.N>, Wells Fargo <WFC.N> and
JPMorgan <JPM.N>. 
    The preliminary reading on the University of Michigan
consumer sentiment report came in below expectations but was a
still strong 99 for October. [nEMNIA50SJ]
    Treasury yields extended gains after the data. Earlier in
the day Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said it is fair to
question rate hikes by the central bank, following comments
earlier this week by President Donald Trump that the Fed had
""gone crazy"" while Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Trump
respects the central bank's independence.

    BULLS TRY TO TAKE BACK CONTROL (0915 AM EDT/1315 GMT)    
    With stock futures pointing to a higher open, bulls appear
to be reasserting themselves. Indeed, action coming at an
opportune time for the beleaguered NYSE Composite <.NYA>. (Click
on chart below)
    The NYA, of course, was one index that was unable to surpass
its January peak. In fact it topped in September right at the
76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of its January/February
slide.
    It has since, collapsed, and at the depths of Thursday's
market swoon, it was down close to 10 percent from its record
high.
    However, with a small rebound into the close, the index
managed to hold the channel support line from its February
trough. This just as the NYSE McClellan Oscillator (McOsc)
<.AD.N>, a breadth/momentum measure, was testing its February
low. (Refinitiv data) With the McOsc having reached fertile
ground for a reversal, the NYA is indeed poised to rally.
    However, with the February/September recovery still looking
like a protracted counter-trend bounce (Elliott Wave basis),
whatever strength now develops has a lot of work to do to prove
it isn't just another modest pause in a developing bear trend,
that will ultimately take out the February trough.
    NYA faces shorter-term Fibonacci hurdles in the
12,573/12,741 area. These ahead of 12,913/13,066 swing levels.

    U.S. STOCK FUTURES POINT TO BOUNCE AFTER SELLOFF (0847 AM
EDT/1247 GMT) 
    Equities were poised to bounce at the open on Friday as
stocks attempt to stabilize after a selloff that has sent the
S&P <.SPX> down 5.5 percent this week, putting it on pace for
its worst weekly performance since late March. 
    Banks are in focus as earnings season gets underway, with
Citigroup <C.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all
higher premarket after posting results and supporting gains.
[nL4N1WS4F8][nL4N1WS456][nL4N1WS4GE]
    Data showed U.S. import prices jumped faster than expected
in September amid resurgent energy prices but prices excluding
fuels were unchanged. Shortly after the open, preliminary
consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan is
scheduled to be released. 
    
 
 
 
    Earnings will be in focus as Q3 results begin to flow, with
investors keeping close tabs on corporate outlooks for any
impact of trade battles. Recent warnings from names such as PPG
Industries <PPG.N> and Fastenal <FAST.O> have helped unnerve
investors this week. 
    European indices are bouncing after sharp selloffs earlier
this week, although Europe was on track for its worst week since
February. Asian shares also closed higher.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 12: Fitch Ratings has placed Banca Carige 
S.p.A. - Cassa di Risparmio di Genova e Imperia's (Carige, CCC+/RWN/ccc+) soft 
bullet mortgage covered bonds (Obbligazioni Bancarie Garantite, OBG) - rated 
'BBB+' - on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).

The rating action follows the downgrade of Carige Long-Term Issuer Default 
Rating (IDR) and the RWN placed on the IDR (see ""Fitch Downgrades Carige to 
'CCC+'; on Rating Watch Negative"" dated 10 October 2018 available at 
www.fitchratings.com). Fitch will resolve the RWN on the covered bonds upon the 
resolution of the RWN on the bank's IDR.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The downgrade of Carige's IDR has no impact on the rating of the OBG, which had 
an unused single notch from the Payment Continuity Uplift (PCU). The OBG 
programme is now rated at its maximum achievable rating, and the RWN on the 
programme rating mirrors that on Carige's IDR. 

Carige OBG are rated 'BBB+', nine notches above the bank's Long-Term IDR of 
'CCC+'. This is based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two notches, an unchanged 
PCU of four notches and a recovery uplift of three notches. The asset percentage 
(AP) of 81.97% that Fitch relies upon (as reported in the investor report dated 
July 2018) provides more protection than the 'BBB+' breakeven AP of 92% (from 
92.5%). 

The credit loss is revised down to 4.1% from 4.5% as the middle-loaded default 
distribution is now applied to the recovery rate vector for residential mortgage 
loans in covered bonds analysis. 

The ALM loss is 4.3%: the weighted average life of the liabilities is 3.5 years 
and that of the cover assets is 8.6 years.

The unchanged IDR uplift of two notches reflects the covered bonds exemption 
from bail-in, the low risk of under-collateralisation at the point of resolution 
and the bank's Long-Term IDR being driven by Viability Rating.

The soft bullet liability profile with a principal maturity extension of 15 
months and a three-month rolling liquidity reserve to cover for interests and 
senior expenses are reflected in the unchanged PCU of four notches, lower than 
the standard uplift typically assigned to soft-bullet programmes. This is due to 
the programme's cover pool-specific alternative management, which in Fitch's 
view poses a high risk to payment continuity on the covered bonds in the event 
that the source of payments switches from the issuer to the cover pool.

Fitch maintains the maximum three-notch recovery uplift for the programme: the 
AP given credit to offsets the credit loss stressed in the covered bonds' rating 
scenario. The tested rating on a probability of default (PD) basis is 
non-investment grade.

CRITERIA VARIATIONS

Fitch varied from its European RMBS Rating Criteria by decreasing the weighted 
average (WA) recovery rate (RR) in each rating scenario. This reflects Fitch's 
view of consistently weaker recovery performance of Carige's residential 
mortgage loans compared with the Italian average. The application of this 
variation has no impact on the OBG rating.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

All else being equal, the 'BBB+' rating of the soft bullet OBG issued by Banca 
Carige - Cassa di Risparmio di Genova e Imperia would be vulnerable to a 
downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) Carige's Long-Term Issuer Default 
Rating (IDR) is downgraded to 'CCC' or below; or (ii) the relied-upon AP, which 
is disclosed in the investor report, rises above Fitch's 'BBB+' breakeven AP of 
92%.

Fitch's breakeven AP for a given OBG rating will be affected by, among other 
factors, the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, 
which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, the 
breakeven AP for a covered bonds rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over 
time.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - British businesses want an end to
the uncertainty over the terms of Britain's exit from the
European Union, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden
told the Northern Echo newspaper in an interview published on
Friday.
    Prime Minister Theresa May hopes to secure a Brexit
transition deal within the next six weeks, and Ramsden said
deadlines were nearing for business and the BoE's own
contingency planning.
    ""We are coming up to some key milestones in the negotiations
where planning is having to be increased. They have to plan for
these very challenging outcomes if there was a cliff-edge
Brexit,"" Ramsden said.
    He spoke to the newspaper after visiting firms in northeast
England including carmaker Nissan <7201.T>.
    Last week Nissan, which operates Britain's largest car
factory, said Britain leaving the EU without a deal would have
""serious implications"" for the country's manufacturing industry.
[nL8N1WK0WX]
    ""The sense we pick up from Nissan is that people recognise
there is a negotiation on Brexit that has to take place and has
to be resolved, and all industries want to see a resolution to
that. They want an end to the uncertainty,"" Ramsden said.
    The BoE's stress test of British banks' financial resilience
last year encompassed scenarios representing ""a very bad
Brexit"", he told the newspaper.
    But the BoE's central scenario, which assumes that Brexit
goes smoothly, is for the economy to grow by about 1.75 percent
a year and for the labour market to strengthen.
    ""Markets are expecting, that, in that world, we'll be
putting up rates over the next two or three years. I think the
current market expectation is two or three more rate increases
over the next two or three years,"" Ramsden said.
    The BoE last raised rates in August, and economists polled
by Reuters do not expect another rate rise until after Britain
leaves the EU on March 29 next year.

    MARGIN CLERK SELLOFF FLASHBACKS (1050 AM EDT/1450 GMT)
    Intraday market declines seen in trading during the past
days is giving one strategist shudders of the Financial Crisis. 
    ""Instead of rallying after 10 am, U.S. stocks began to sell
off,"" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research,
about Thursday's trading. This was a reminder of the ""dreaded
""margin clerk selloff"" that typically occurred mid-morning
during 2008,"" Colas wrote. 
    In its sixth consecutive day of declines, the S&P closed
down 2.1 percent on Thursday after shedding 3 percent in
Wednesday's session. At its session low the benchmark fell 2.7
percent to its lowest level since early July. [nL2N1WR22T]
    During 2008, there were periods where there would be waves
of selling mid-morning when it became clear that hedge funds,
other institutions as well as retail were deleveraging, Colas
said. However, while it may have been a problem in recent days,
it is difficult to pinpoint the extent to which investors
deleveraged.  
    ""Margin leverage builds up during bull markets when you have
a low volatility meltup as we have had for much of the summer -
because it becomes relatively painless and you can amplify
returns,"" Colas said. ""In a low return environment with low
volatility, leverage will tend to build up everywhere in the
system.""

    STOCKS STOP BLEEDING AS TECH SURGES (1024 AM EDT/1424 GMT)
    Equities have stopped the bleeding for the time being, after
a punishing selloff that sent the S&P 500 <.SPX> down nearly 7
percent from its September 20 high. 
    Tech <.SPLRCT>, one of the primary culprits of the downturn,
is helping fuel the rebound today as it is on track for its
biggest daily percentage gain since late March. 
    Still, equities had fallen from their initial highs that
sent the benchmark S&P index briefly back above its 200-day
moving average as banks lost their premarket steam in the wake
of earnings from Citigroup <C.N>, Wells Fargo <WFC.N> and
JPMorgan <JPM.N>. 
    The preliminary reading on the University of Michigan
consumer sentiment report came in below expectations but was a
still strong 99 for October. [nEMNIA50SJ]
    Treasury yields extended gains after the data. Earlier in
the day Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said it is fair to
question rate hikes by the central bank, following comments
earlier this week by President Donald Trump that the Fed had
""gone crazy"" while Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Trump
respects the central bank's independence.

    BULLS TRY TO TAKE BACK CONTROL (0915 AM EDT/1315 GMT)    
    With stock futures pointing to a higher open, bulls appear
to be reasserting themselves. Indeed, action coming at an
opportune time for the beleaguered NYSE Composite <.NYA>. (Click
on chart below)
    The NYA, of course, was one index that was unable to surpass
its January peak. In fact it topped in September right at the
76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of its January/February
slide.
    It has since, collapsed, and at the depths of Thursday's
market swoon, it was down close to 10 percent from its record
high.
    However, with a small rebound into the close, the index
managed to hold the channel support line from its February
trough. This just as the NYSE McClellan Oscillator (McOsc)
<.AD.N>, a breadth/momentum measure, was testing its February
low. (Refinitiv data) With the McOsc having reached fertile
ground for a reversal, the NYA is indeed poised to rally.
    However, with the February/September recovery still looking
like a protracted counter-trend bounce (Elliott Wave basis),
whatever strength now develops has a lot of work to do to prove
it isn't just another modest pause in a developing bear trend,
that will ultimately take out the February trough.
    NYA faces shorter-term Fibonacci hurdles in the
12,573/12,741 area. These ahead of 12,913/13,066 swing levels.

    U.S. STOCK FUTURES POINT TO BOUNCE AFTER SELLOFF (0847 AM
EDT/1247 GMT) 
    Equities were poised to bounce at the open on Friday as
stocks attempt to stabilize after a selloff that has sent the
S&P <.SPX> down 5.5 percent this week, putting it on pace for
its worst weekly performance since late March. 
    Banks are in focus as earnings season gets underway, with
Citigroup <C.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all
higher premarket after posting results and supporting gains.
[nL4N1WS4F8][nL4N1WS456][nL4N1WS4GE]
    Data showed U.S. import prices jumped faster than expected
in September amid resurgent energy prices but prices excluding
fuels were unchanged. Shortly after the open, preliminary
consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan is
scheduled to be released. 
    
 
 
 
    Earnings will be in focus as Q3 results begin to flow, with
investors keeping close tabs on corporate outlooks for any
impact of trade battles. Recent warnings from names such as PPG
Industries <PPG.N> and Fastenal <FAST.O> have helped unnerve
investors this week. 
    European indices are bouncing after sharp selloffs earlier
this week, although Europe was on track for its worst week since
February. Asian shares also closed higher.

 (Updates market action, changes dateline, previous LONDON)
    By Richard Leong
    NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Friday
against a basket of currencies as global equity prices rebounded
from a six-day rout and robust Chinese export figures soothed
some worries about the world's second-biggest economy and its
trade war with Washington.
    Euro and sterling snapped their three-day winning streak in
advance of next week's European Union summit where Britain and
the economic bloc may strike a Brexit deal. [nL8N1WS2KK]
    China's exports jumped 14.5 percent in September from a year
earlier, the biggest year-over-year increase in seven months and
marking a record trade surplus with the United States. This
suggested the tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped on
Beijing have yet to bite. [nL4N1WP28H]    
    ""The market breathed a sigh of relief with the Chinese trade
numbers despite the tit-for-tat trade war with the U.S.,"" said
Dean Popplewell, vice president of market analysis at Oanda in
Toronto. ""People were happy to put on some risk.""    
    A weaker yuan likely mitigated the sting from U.S. duties on
$250 billion worth of Chinese-made goods, analysts said.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday he
told China's central bank chief that currency issues need to be
part of any further U.S.-China trade talks. [nL2N1WS0LU]
    At 10:43 a.m. (1443 GMT), an index that tracks the dollar
versus six major currencies <.DXY> was up 0.29 percent at
95.291. 
    It touched a seven-week high of 96.15 on Tuesday as U.S.
10-year Treasury yield <US10YT=RR> hit a 7-year peak due to 
worries about rising inflation and U.S. government debt supply.
    The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which
tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 1.16 percent on the day. 
    The euro and pound retreated from two-week and three-week
peaks, respectively, versus the greenback reached following
comments from EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday
who suggested an agreement for Britain to leave the EU could be
reached next week.    
    The single currency was down 0.35 percent at $1.1553, while 
sterling was 0.52 percent lower at $1.3166.    
    The common currency also fell after European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi toned down his outlook for a rise in
underlying inflation from ""relatively vigorous"" to ""gradual.""
[nL8N1WS1VP]
    The Chinese yuan <CNH=EBS> fell 0.5 percent to 6.9123 per
dollar in offshore trading, as the latest Chinese export figures
stoked concerns they would ratchet up trade tension between
China and the United States.

    PARIS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
said on Friday it was not clear whether a foiled attack on a
Paris-based Iranian opposition group was ordered by the higher
echelons of authorities in Tehran. 
    ""As you know Iran is sometimes divided into different
factions and tensions, and so I can't say today whether the
order came from the top or from this (security) service or that
division,"" he told France 24 television in an interview. 
    France's foreign ministry said on Oct. 2 there was no doubt
the Iranian intelligence ministry was behind the June plot and
froze assets belonging to Tehran's intelligence services and two
Iranian nationals. [nL8N1WI2LU]
    The plot targeted a meeting of the National Council of
Resistance of Iran (NCRI) outside Paris. U.S. President Donald
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and several former European and
Arab ministers attended the rally. 
    Belgium charged an Iranian diplomat and three other
individuals on Oct. 10 with planning to bomb the meeting.
[nL8N1WQ5O3] Two of the suspects were intercepted by Belgian
police. 
    One senior French official told Reuters the plot is likely
to have been hatched by hardliners looking to undermine
President Hassan Rouhani, who has tried to improve Iran's
relations with the outside world. 
    Macron said he was still awaiting explanations, but that
Rouhani had not given him any during two exchanges he had with
the Iranian president.
    The hardening of relations between Paris and Tehran could
have far-reaching consequences for Rouhani's government, which
is looking to European capitals to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal
after the United States pulled out and reimposed tough
sanctions.
    Macron repeated that there should be a more demanding policy
towards Iran which needed to include keeping the existing deal,
discussing its nuclear work after 2025 when parts of the
agreement expire, its ballistic missile programme and curtailing
its regional influence. 
    ""I've never been naive with Iran or thought it would be
easy,"" Macron said.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/London-October 12: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Poland's 
Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-' with a Stable 
Outlook. 

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Poland's 'A-' rating reflects its diversified economy and strong macroeconomic 
fundamentals, supported by a sound economic policy framework, and a strong 
banking sector. These are balanced against weak GDP per capita and high external 
debt compared with the peer median.

Real GDP growth is currently above peers, at 5.2% yoy in 1H18, from 4.6% in 
2017, driven by strong consumption and investment. GDP growth volatility is far 
below the current 'A' range median. Fitch has revised its GDP growth forecasts 
to 4.8% for 2018 (from 4.4%) and 3.6% for 2019 (from 3.4%), envisaging stronger 
private and government consumption, as well as a smaller projected negative 
contribution from net exports. Growth is likely to slow to 2.9% in 2020 as 
investments tail off and wage growth (and hence household consumption) slow.

Higher government expenditure - particularly on wages and social payments - has 
been offset by structural as well as cyclical improvements in revenue 
collection. The headline deficit contracted from a high of 4.8% of GDP in 2011 
to 1.7% in 2017. Poland's projected fiscal deficit of 1.8% of GDP for 2018 is 
below the current 'A' median. A widening of the fiscal deficit is likely, given 
projected higher expenditures and the forecast slower growth, resulting in a 
projected budget deficit of 2.0% of GDP in 2019 and 2.2% in 2020. Fitch expects 
compliance with the expenditure rule despite pressures on spending over the 
forecast horizon.

General government debt (GGD) is above the current 'A' median, at a projected 
50% of GDP in 2018. The GGD/revenues ratio is below the current 'A' median, 
reflecting a large and diverse revenue base. Fitch expects GGD to stabilise at 
around 50% of GDP in 2018-20. Poland's exposure to FX risks is relatively high 
compared with its 'A' rated peers, given that over 27% of its public debt is 
denominated in FX. However, this ratio has been on a steadily declining trend, 
from 34.4% in 2016, and is in line with the authorities' plan to reduce the 
level to under 30% as part of the 2018-2021 Public Debt Management Strategy. 

Net external debt, at a projected 26.5% of GDP in 2018, compares unfavourably 
with the current 'A' median of -8.3%. However, Poland's net external debt levels 
have been steadily falling in recent years, from a peak of 38% in 2013. FDI and 
non-debt capital inflows in the form of EU grants should cover the forecast 
current account deficit for 2018-2020, allowing a further decline in net 
external debt. As of 2Q18, just over 49% of all public debt was held by 
non-residents, the first time the proportion had fallen below 50% since 2012. As 
of 2Q, over 31% of local currency government debt was held by non-residents 
(down from a peak of 35.3% in 2014, and largely unchanged from end-2017).

While headline inflation continues to edge up (to 2% yoy in August) driven in 
part by fuel price increases (15.3% yoy), core inflation remains weak at 0.6%. 
Driven by record low unemployment (5.8% as of August 2018), wage growth has been 
strong (6.7% yoy average increase in 1H18). However, given the relatively small 
share of wages in large corporations' costs, the pass-through of wage growth to 
inflation has been more limited.

Fitch expects inflation to rise towards the upper end of central bank's 2.5% +/- 
1pp target, causing the central bank to hike rates during 2H19 (the policy rate 
has remained at 1.5% since March 2015). The hiking cycle will continue in 2020, 
partly reflecting forecast moves in ECB rates.

Political tensions continue between Poland and the European Commission. 
Procedures under Article VII of the EU treaty were launched against Poland in 
December 2017 over judicial reforms. Poland's responses have so far been 
insufficient for the EC. In September 2018, the European Networks of Councils 
for the Judiciary - a representative body of judiciaries of EU member states - 
stripped Poland of its voting rights in the body. An additional confrontation is 
a pending EC suit against Poland before the European Court of Justice on the 
issue. An adverse verdict against Poland would almost certainly lead to a 
further deterioration in Poland-EU relations.

Draft EU budget proposals for the next funding cycle (2021-2027) suggest a cut 
to Poland's allocation (amounting to 0.4% of GDP annually) and a proposal to 
introduce conditionality connected to the rule of law has been suggested. EU 
funds have played an important role in the development of the economy. However, 
any downside risks to their receipt would only materialise after 2021. The 
introduction of a new mandatory pension plan from January 2019 could provide a 
new source of domestic investment, given a cap on the foreign investment of its 
assets.

Governance indicators are broadly in line with peers, but have slipped in the 
World Bank's assessment. Poland is in the middle of an electoral cycle, starting 
with local elections in October-November 2018, European parliamentary elections 
in May 2019, parliamentary elections (due by November 2019) and presidential 
elections, due by August 2020. The ruling PiS party appears in a strong 
position, with over 40% of public support according to opinion polls.

SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO)

Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Poland a score equivalent to a rating of 'A' on 
the Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LT FC) IDR scale. 

- External finances: -1 notch, to reflect Poland's high net external debt 
relative to peers.

Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that 
employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of 
forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a 
forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the 
SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria 
that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that upside and downside risks to 
the rating are currently balanced. Nonetheless, the following risk factors 
could, individually or collectively, trigger positive rating action:

- Further sustained reduction in net external debt/GDP towards the 'A' category 
median

- Fiscal consolidation that leads to a sustained decline in public debt/GDP.

- GDP growth that supports faster income convergence towards the 'A' category 
median.

The following risk factors could, individually or collectively, trigger negative 
rating action:

- Any sign that the relevance of the 3% of GDP EU deficit criteria weakens as a 
fiscal anchor, or failure to stabilise the debt/GDP ratio in the medium term.

- Weaker macro-economic policy framework, potentially resulting in lower GDP 
growth.

- Deterioration in governance standards or the business climate leading to an 
adverse impact on the economy.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch assumes that economies in the eurozone, Poland's main trading partner, 
will grow by 2% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.6% in 2020.

    By John Lloyd
    Oct 12 (Reuters) - The next president of Brazil, Latin
America’s giant, is all but certain to be former army captain
Jair Bolsonaro – who was relatively unknown, even in his own
country, just a few months ago, but who now has a very large
public profile all round the world. At 63, he has spent years in
public life, leaving a mark – but not a large one – as a man of
the far right, ready with insults for women who oppose him,
disgusted by homosexuality, approving of the military
dictatorship that killed and tortured leftists between 1964 and
1985.
    In the first round of the presidential election earlier this
week, this obscure man nearly won outright, with 46 percent of
the vote (as compared to the 29 percent secured by Fernando
Haddad, a minister in the Workers’ Party government which had
ruled Brazil for 13 years and whose time now seems to be up.
    Halfway around the world from Brazil, in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, its 3.5 million population a mere 60th of Brazil’s
211 million, another strongly nationalist politician, Milorad
Dodik, won election this week to the three-person presidency
which has governed the tiny state since the 1995 Dayton Accords
ended its three-year internecine war. Dodik is a threat to the
delicate and now precarious balance of powers in this sliver of
the former Yugoslavia – tiny, but with the potential to fan to
life the animosities which had been suppressed.
    For his part, Bolsonaro will soon have the power, and
perhaps the inclination, to revive the gruesome divisions of the
past and to force a great state to turn inward, to be again
consumed with the animosity and fear it seemed to have left
behind.
    These are very different men in quite diverse societies.
What unites them, beyond their victories in this past week, is
that they respond to, and amplify, the beat of a drum which
grows louder across the globe. It beats out an imperative rhythm
of “we first”: we the nation; we the ethnic group; we the people
who are victims, and not beneficiaries, of globalization; we who
want simple solutions, and not endless debate, who are prepared
to trade that for order, and a strong hand.
    In Brazil in the first decade of the new century, Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva (Lula), a working-class radical socialist,
followed the market-friendly course of the previous government
when he took power in 2003. In his eight years as president he
steered Brazil towards the world’s first division. The country
was democratic, with ambitious anti-poverty programs, but with
IMF-approved economic policies, a state whose progress in the
economy and in the general esteem of the world’s elites allowed
Lula to play a part on the world stage, notably in mediating
Latin American disputes. A sign of Brazilian times: Lula is now
in prison, serving a 12-year sentence for corruption Many of his
supporters at home and abroad believe him to be innocent – and
he tried to make a comeback in this month’s presidential
election – but a Brazilian court ruled that he could not run.
    Haddad will pick up some votes from supporters of Ciro
Gomes, a 60-year old centrist politician who came third with 12
percent of the vote. However, securing the 20-plus percent he
needs to clinch the presidency, against the four percent
Bolsonaro needs, is likely too steep a climb. It will be the
more so, since Haddad’s reputation is not that of a strong
leader, in a country which seems disposed to select one.
    Bolsonaro has invited comparisons with President Donald
Trump and with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines –
comparisons which are, within limits, illuminating. Duterte
reached a large mass of people who had felt neglected, even
despised, by liberals in power – and at the mercy of drug gangs
and corrupt politicians and police. His ruthlessness in
encouraging police to confront and kill gangsters, to diminish
or ignore human rights and to silence independent media have
been accepted, by most, as the price of greater security.
    Bolsonaro seems likely to emulate some of that. His backing
comes from a broad swath of Brazilians, with support from the
middle and upper classes who opposed Lula’s efforts to help the
poor, as well as some of the poor who are victims of the
country’s gangs and drug lords.
    Most damaging for the Workers’ Party, most helpful to
Bolsonaro, a vast enquiry into corruption – known as Operation
Car Wash – revealed over the past few years corruption in every
party, including the ruling Workers Party. Both Lula and his
successor Dilma Rousseff, were implicated. Rousseff was
impeached and removed from office, and Lula was sent to jail.
Bolsonaro, with no previous office, has no charges of corruption
against him.
    A Roman Catholic, Bolsonaro still has the support of Edir
Macedo, the evangelical pastor – known as the bishop –- who
founded and leads Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a
Pentecostalist of the prosperity gospel persuasion. Macedo’s
church has made him both a billionaire and the subject of many
criminal investigations. For millions, however, he is a comfort
and an inspiration. With such backing, it’s hard to see how
Bolsonaro will lose. His challenge will be to govern within the
law and to avoid straining democratic norms to breaking point.
    Back in Central Europe Dodik has, since 2006, run the
Serbian part of the state, the Republika Srpska. A Croat and a
Bosnian Muslim represent the two other main ethnic groups in the
Croat-Muslim federation. Dodik is keen to split up the country,
so that the Serbs cease to be required to cooperate with Muslims
and Croats, enemies during the war in which 100,000 died. He
enjoys a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir
Putin and is deeply opposed to NATO and the European Union.
    Dodik’s is the more immediately consequential election, even
if on a narrow ground. His win prompts fears that the elaborate
compromise, which has kept the peace in Bosnia for 23 years,
will now unravel, and hatreds, damped down but not rooted out,
will again flare into conflict.
    In Latin America’s leading economy and in the cockpit of
Europe’s still-smouldering hostilities, one man has been elected
and another all but certainly will be elected, both of whom have
a stake not in compromise, but in confrontation. Branding
liberals and peacemakers as ineffectual, rousing popular support
to right old wrongs, real or imaginary, putting their part of
the people first, last and always, means that the elections of
this week are bad news for a strained world.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Italian officials
must stop questioning the euro and need to ""calm down"" in their
budget debate as they have already caused damage to firms and
households, European Central Bank ECB President Mario Draghi
said on Saturday.
    Italy's government has been locked in a war of words with
European officials over Rome's plans to triple the deficit next
year, backtracking on a previous pledge to narrow the budget gap
in one of the bloc's most indebted countries. [nL8N1WP21C]
    ""A budgetary expansion in a high debt country becomes much
more complicated... if people start to put in question the
euro,"" Draghi told a news conference in Indonesia at the
International Monetary Fund's annual meeting.
    ""These statements... have created real damage and there’s
plenty of evidence that spreads have increased in connection
with these statements,"" Draghi said. ""The results of which is
that household and firms pay higher interest rates on loans.""
    Italian bond yields rose sharply earlier this autumn after a
senior official from one of the ruling parties argued that Italy
would benefit from leaving the euro, comments he backtracked on
after the market backlash. [nR1N1RB01P]
    ""The very first thing (to do) is to calm down with the tone.
And then the second thing is we have to wait for the facts,""
Draghi said, stressing the need to examine the actual spending
plans, which may differ from the government's communication. 
    But Draghi also batted back accusations from some corners in
the Italian government that the ECB's own plan to phase out
asset purchases by the end of the year had caused the increase
in spreads.
    Draghi, a former governor of Italy's central bank, said
markets had not reacted in June to the ECB's decision to end its
asset buys but had moved specifically on local Italian issues.
    He pointed to the narrowing of the yield difference between
Italy and Greece as evidence that the problem is localised. 
    Since the ECB is buying Italian but not Greek bonds, a
bigger rise in Italian yields would suggest that investors are
not acting on overall ECB policy change but a local issue.

does not plan to raise  electricity prices for households in
2019, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday.
    Electricity prices on the Polish power exchange leapt 60-70
percent year-on-year in September on the back of higher coal
prices and the rising cost of carbon emissions permits.
    ""There are currently no electricity prices increases. This
is again hysteria caused by some media. We have electricity
prices at the Czech or Lithuanian level,"" Morawiecki told
private radio RMF FM.
    The head of the energy market regulator URE suggested in
September that he might allow Polish state-run utilities to
raise power prices for households next year, although the energy
minister said prices would remain unchanged. 
    Analysts also say that Poland's state-run power groups are
unlikely to seek regulatory approval to raise power prices for
households ahead of regional polls next month and a national
election next year, although this may hit their profits.
    ""Next year the energy regulatory office does not plan, as
far as I know, tariff increases for households,"" Morawiecki
said. 
    ""From the point of view of entrepreneurs and Polish
industry, we are working, just in case, on appropriate plans
that would mitigate any changes in electricity prices if they
take place. Germany and Austria have similar mechanisms.""
    Poland has liberalised power prices for companies but still
regulates them for households. The current electricity tariff
expires at the end of this year.

Bavarian allies are heading for their worst state election
result in over 60 years in a regional vote on Sunday that is
likely to increase tensions within Germany's fragile coalition
government.
    According to the latest polls, the Christian Social Union
(CSU) will win around 34 percent, losing the absolute majority
with which the center-right party has controlled its
southeastern heartland for most of the post-war period.
    Voting stations open at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and broadcasters
are expected to publish exit polls shortly after 6 pm (1600
GMT).
    One of the biggest winners are likely to be the ecologist,
pro-immigration Greens who are projected to more than double
their vote share to up to 19 percent and overtake the
centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) as the second-strongest
party.
    The regional protest party Free Voters and the
anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party are both
forecast to win roughly 10 percent of the votes.
    This could complicate CSU State Premier Markus Soeder's
efforts to form a stable coalition government in Bavaria.
    The splintered electoral result could force Soeder, who has
ruled out a coalition with the AfD, into an awkward alliance
with the left-of-centre Greens.
    Horst Seehofer, CSU party leader and interior minister in
Merkel's federal government, could face calls to give up at
least one of his posts following the Bavarian election as his
hard-line rhetoric against asylum seekers is likely to scare
away voters.
    ""We've lost trust because of the CSU,"" Volker Bouffier,
deputy party leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU), told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. He accused Seehofer of
damaging the image of the CDU/CSU conservative alliance.
    Bouffier is premier in the state of Hesse where another
regional election will be held later this month.
    Seehofer has been among Merkel's fiercest critics following
her decision in 2015 to welcome more than 1 million migrants. He
has gradually shifted the CSU, the sister party to the CDU, to
the right to counter the rise of the AfD party.
    Divisions between the conservative allies have widened
further since March, when an inconclusive national election
forced them into a coalition with the left-leaning SPD.
    Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already
come close to collapsing twice, in arguments over immigration
and a scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster. The
parties are also at odds over how to phase out polluting diesel
cars and whether to grant tax cuts for the rich.

    By Farah Salhi
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The centre-right is expected
to return to power in Luxembourg after a rare five years in
opposition when voters elect a new parliament on Sunday.
    Opinions polls indicate that the Christian Social People's
Party (CSV) - which was led for 19 years by EU chief executive
Jean-Claude Juncker - will end Xavier Bettel's five years as
prime minister of a liberal coalition.
    However, the CSV could fall short of an outright majority in
the 60-seat chamber, meaning its leader Claude Wiseler would
need to find an ally from one of the three governing parties -
Bettel's Democratic Party, the Socialist Worker's Party or the
Greens.
    Voting began at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and was due to end at 2
p.m. with most results expected in the evening.
    The ruling parties took advantage of voters' discontent in
2013  when Juncker called a snap election after a wire-tapping
scandal, pushing the CSV out of government for the first time
since World War Two.
    Teacher Muriel Schroeder, like many voters, said education
was a core issue at the election, but also said she wanted the
country to shift its policy towards foreigners.
    ""I am in favour of welcoming foreigners and I wouldn't like
the country to move towards extremism like in other countries,""
she said before voting.
    Unlike some neighbours, where migration has boosted
anti-immigrant parties, the far right has not made inroads in
Luxembourg.
    However, in 2015 Luxembourgers decisively rejected giving
the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreigners,
mostly from Portugal, France and other EU countries.
    Whatever the future government, the foreign policy of the
European Union's wealthiest but second-smallest state is
unlikely to change much. 
    To avoid isolation in the EU, Luxembourg has been adapting
its economic model, recently ending bank secrecy under pressure
from bigger neighbours which have called it a centre for tax
avoidance.
    Financial services is the largest sector in the Grand
Duchy's economy, which was once dominated by steel.

with the next manned flight in December although the plans could
change depending on the results of a commission set up to probe
the incident. Interfax reported on Saturday, citing a source,
that the flight could take place on Nov. 28. [nL8N1WT0IE]

carried out a reshuffle of his cabinet following the resignation
of the defence minister and completion of next year's budget,
making changes at four ministries ahead of a general election in
2019.
    The changes include adding to Cabinet Minister Pedro Siza
Vieira's responsibilities by also putting him in charge of the
powerful economy ministry, which has recently gained importance
thanks to surging foreign investment and strong economic growth.
    This will be Prime Minister Antonio Costa's biggest cabinet
reshuffle since his minority Socialist government came to power
in 2015 and will aim to bolster the administration going into
next year's election. The Socialists lead in opinion polls with
about 40 percent support.
    The cabinet reshuffle comes after the government this
weekend approved next year's draft budget, which will be
presented on Monday to parliament.
    The reshuffle was announced in a statement by the office of
President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has to approve the
nominations. The new ministers will be sworn in on Monday.
    Siza Vieira, a lawyer, joined the government a year ago
after previously working for law firm Linklaters. He will
replace outgoing Economy Minister Manuel Caldeira Cabral. Under
the change the energy sector will be transferred to the
environment ministry.
    Defence Minister Jose Azeredo Lopes resigned on Friday amid
an investigation into a suspected army cover-up of the theft of
a cachet of arms from a military depot last year. He will be
replaced by Joao Gomes Cravinho, who is currently the European
Union's ambassador to Brazil. [nL8N1WS52C]  
    Graca Maria da Fonseca will become the new minister of
culture after working as secretary of state for administrative

    By Gabriela Baczynska and Elizabeth Piper
    BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - British Brexit minister
Dominic Raab will hold talks with the EU's chief negotiator on
Sunday, the first in a flurry of formal meetings in Brussels
where officials are trying to hammer out agreement on the terms
of a divorce deal.
    With less than six months until Brexit day and Prime
Minister Theresa May due in Brussels for a summit on Wednesday,
both sides are holding intensive talks to try to seal an
agreement ending Britain's more than 40 years in the European
Union.
    Raab was due to meet Michel Barnier, the bloc's negotiator,
after his department said it was ""jointly agreed that
face-to-face talks were necessary"" on the ""big issues still to
resolve"". Ambassadors to the other 27 EU member states were
summoned to another meeting.
    It was unclear whether there had been progress on one of the
major issues - a ""backstop"" to prevent a return to controls on
the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and
EU member Ireland. This arrangement has strengthened opposition
to May's plans after her Northern Irish allies accused the bloc
of trying to annex the province. [nL8N1WT09H]
    One diplomat said on condition of anonmyity that the
ambassadors' meeting could suggest a breakthrough, while another
said it could signal there had been no agreement.
    Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy for
decades is dividing the prime minister's Conservative Party,
with critics, such as Raab's predecessor, pressing May to change
her strategy.
    David Davis, who resigned as Brexit minister in July,
accused the government on Sunday of accepting ""the EU's language
on dealing with the Northern Ireland border"".
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" wrote Davis, who
campaigned for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
    ""This week the authority of our constitution is on the
line,"" he said in an article in the Sunday Times.
    Davis also pressed May to abandon her Brexit proposal, which
involves staying in a free trade zone with the EU for
manufactured and agricultural goods. The bloc ""has rejected it.
The public does not like it. Parliament will not vote for it,""
he wrote.
    
    LOBBYING
    So far, May has shown little appetite to change tack, 
trying to persuade Conservative lawmakers and those in the
opposition Labour Party to vote for any deal based on her plan.
    Lobbying of May from all sides has increased in recent weeks
as London and Brussels edge closer to an agreement on a draft
withdrawal treaty to cover the divorce terms, a transition
period and a solution for Northern Ireland.
    Preventing any return of a ""hard"" border in Ireland has
become one of the major obstacles, with Brexit campaigners
fearful that a backstop with no time limit will keep Britain
inside a customs union with the EU indefinitely.
    May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop
must be temporary, but the EU has refused to set an end date.
    Health minister Matt Hancock suggested the backstop could be
temporary without such a date, an argument that may fall flat
with some eurosceptic lawmakers who are calling for May to
""chuck Chequers"", her Brexit plan named after her country
residence.
    ""There are different ways to ensure that something is time
limited,"" Hancock told the BBC. ""For instance, you can set
conditions at the point at which the arrangements come to an
end.""
    Even if May reaches a withdrawal agreement, she will
struggle to get it through parliament and may find opposition
from the small Northern Irish party which props up here minority
government to other legislation such as the budget. [nL8N1WQ41Q]
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' but the dangers
of a bad deal are worse,"" Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic
Unionist Party, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules
made in a place where we have no say.""

    BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Brexit negotiators have
yet to seal a deal on Britain's divorce terms, EU officials said
on Sunday, after a flurry of meetings in Brussels to try to move
the talks forward before Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for
a summit this week.
    With less than six months until Britain leaves the European
Union, Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab met EU negotiator
Michel Barnier and the ambassadors of the 27 other member states
were separately summoned to a meeting.
    But senior EU sources said negotiations had yet to produce a
final deal for leaders to approve this week, and some signalled
that more meetings would be necessary to get agreement on the
withdrawal terms. [nB5N1U6019]
    The ambassadors were also told there was as yet no agreement
with Britain, two EU diplomatic sources said. [nL8N1WU0QE] 
    Raab had raced to Brussels after the two sides ""jointly

    By Gabriela Baczynska, Alastair Macdonald and Elizabeth
Piper
    BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The stubborn problem of
Ireland's land border with Britain defeated marathon talks to
seal a Brexit deal on Sunday in time for a European Union summit
this week.
    Britain and the EU called a pause in the Brexit negotiations
until leaders of member states meet in Brussels, four EU sources
told Reuters, dealing a blow to hopes that a flurry of talks
could secure a draft agreement beforehand.
    It is now not clear what, if anything, leaders of the 27
countries that will remain in the EU can agree to when they
gather over dinner on Wednesday, before British Prime Minister
Theresa May joins them at a regular summit on Thursday. 
    With less than six months until Britain leaves the EU,
Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab met EU negotiator Michel
Barnier on Sunday.
    But a ""backstop"" to prevent a return to controls on the
border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU
member Ireland once again got in the way. 
    ""Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open,
including the backstop for IE/NI to avoid a hard border,""
Barnier tweeted after his talks with Raab.
    Both sides want to avoid a return to checks on what will
become the United Kingdom's only land border with the EU to
avoid hindering trade on the island of Ireland and reawakening
tensions two decades after a peace deal ended years of violence
in Northern Ireland.
    However, the EU insists Britain give assurances that, in the
event future negotiations fail to ensure a UK-EU trade deal
which can avoid a hard border, Northern Ireland should remain
inside the EU's economic rules. May and her allies in Belfast
reject that.
    ""Despite constructive and intensive negotiations, several
key issues remain unresolved,"" one senior EU diplomat said. ""No
further negotiations are planned ahead of the European Council.
The EU negotiator will brief the leaders who will then assess
the progress so far.""
    
    FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS     
    Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy for
decades is also dividing the prime minister's Conservative
Party, with critics, such as Raab's predecessor, pressing May to
change her strategy.
    David Davis, who resigned as Brexit minister in July,
accused the government earlier on Sunday of accepting ""the EU's
language on dealing with the Northern Ireland border"".
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" wrote Davis, who
campaigned for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
    ""This week the authority of our constitution is on the
line,"" he said in an article in the Sunday Times.
    Davis also pressed May to abandon her Brexit proposal, which
involves staying in a free trade zone with the EU for
manufactured and agricultural goods. The bloc ""has rejected it.
The public does not like it. Parliament will not vote for it,""
he wrote.
    
    LOBBYING
    So far, May has shown little appetite to change tack, 
trying to persuade Conservative lawmakers and those in the
opposition Labour Party to vote for any deal based on her plan.
    But lobbying of May from all sides has increased in recent
weeks as London and Brussels edge closer to an agreement on a
draft withdrawal treaty to cover the divorce terms, a transition
period and a solution for Northern Ireland.
    Preventing any return of a ""hard"" border in Ireland has
become one of the major obstacles, with Brexit campaigners
fearful that a backstop with no expiry date will keep Britain
inside a customs union with the EU indefinitely.
    May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop
must be temporary, but the EU has refused to set an end date. 
    Even if May reaches a withdrawal agreement, she will
struggle to get it through parliament and may find opposition
from the small Northern Irish party which props up here minority
government to other legislation such as the budget. [nL8N1WQ41Q]
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' but the dangers
of a bad deal are worse,"" Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic
Unionist Party, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules
made in a place where we have no say.""

    NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wall Street
bosses like Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink and their European and
Japanese peers are having to rethink next week’s “Davos in the

there’s no guidance from above. A coordinated pullout is their

    CONTEXT NEWS 
    - Saudi Arabia on Oct. 14 warned against threats to punish
the kingdom over the disappearance of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi, saying it would retaliate against any sanctions with
tougher measures, as international criticism increased.
    - Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist
critical of Saudi Arabia, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey’s government believes he
was murdered inside the building and his body removed. Saudi
Arabia has denied that.
    - “The Kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats
and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose
economic sanctions, using political pressures, or repeating
false accusations,” the official Saudi Press Agency quoted an
unnamed government source as saying, Reuters reported.
    - “The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action,
it will respond with greater action, and that the Kingdom’s
economy has an influential and vital role in the global
economy,” the source added, without elaborating.
    - U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe
punishment” if it turned out Khashoggi was killed in the
consulate, though he said Washington would be “punishing” itself
if it halted military sales to Riyadh, a key ally.
    - Britain, France and Germany told Saudi Arabia they were
treating the case with “the utmost seriousness.”
    - “There needs to be a credible investigation to establish
the truth about what happened, and - if relevant - to identify
those bearing responsibility for the disappearance of Jamal
Khashoggi, and ensure that they are held to account,” the
foreign ministers from the three countries said in a joint
statement.

    By Farah Salhi
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Luxembourg voters delivered
an uncertain outcome in an election on Sunday, leaving the
liberal-led coalition with just enough seats to stay in
government and the traditionally dominant centre-right also
capable of returning to power.
    Opinion polls had indicated that the Christian Social
People's Party (CSV) - which was led for 19 years by EU chief
executive Jean-Claude Juncker - would end Xavier Bettel's five
years as prime minister of a three-party coalition.
    The CSV was on course to be the largest party, but actually
lost seats, according to a projection by broadcaster RTL after
more than 90 percent of the votes were counted. 
    Bettel's Democratic Party's result was unchanged, while his
allies, the Socialist Workers Party (LSAP), slipped. The day's
biggest winners were the third party in government, the Greens.
    The upshot is that Bettel's coalition would have a majority
of 31 seats in the 60-seat chamber, while the CSV would need to
win over his Democratic Party to end its rare spell in
opposition. 
    The CSV was pushed out of government for only the second
time since World War Two in a snap election Juncker called in
2013 after a wire-tapping scandal.
    Unlike some neighbouring countries, where migration has
boosted anti-immigrant parties, the far right has not made
inroads in Luxembourg.
    However, in 2015 Luxembourgers decisively rejected giving
the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreigners,
mostly from Portugal, France and other EU countries.
    Whatever the future government, the foreign policy of the
European Union's wealthiest but second-smallest state is
unlikely to change much. 
    To avoid isolation in the EU, Luxembourg has been adapting
its economic model, recently ending bank secrecy under pressure
from bigger neighbours which have called it a centre for tax
avoidance.
    Financial services is the largest sector in the Grand
Duchy's economy, which was once dominated by steel.

    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Italian cabinet is due to meet
on Monday to approve a 2019 budget which envisages a jump in the
deficit that has upset financial markets and drawn criticism
from the European Commission and other international bodies.
    The government, backed by the right-wing League and the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has already issued the
financial framework for the budget, raising the target for next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.
    That is comfortably below the EU's 3 percent ceiling, but up
sharply from a targeted 1.8 percent this year, flouting EU rules
which call on highly-debt countries like Italy to narrow the
deficit steadily towards a balanced budget.
    The reaction from Brussels has been fierce, with EU
commissioners threatening to reject the package before even
formally receiving it, and triggering a war of words with the
ruling parties in Rome. [nL8N1WR4D0] [nL8N1WP61S] [nL8N1WL29P]
    The Commission says the budget will push up Italy's public
debt which already amounts to 131 percent of GDP,
proportionately the highest in the euro zone after Greece's,
rejecting Rome's argument that the expansionary package can
lower debt by boosting economic growth.
    The budget marks ""a change of gear for Italy"", Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday, adding that he was
confident the EU would soften its stance after the government
has had the chance to explain its growth strategy properly.
    Italy must send its planned fiscal framework to Brussels on
Monday, and the Commission can reject it and ask for changes,
setting off a possible process of negotiations.
    Deputy Prime Minister and 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said
on Friday the cabinet would sign off on the package on Monday,
but no time has yet been set for the meeting and many aspects of
the budget measures have still to be hammered out.
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said last week the deficit
would rise by 22 billion euros ($25.5 billion) next year, with
37 billion euros in spending projects and tax cuts partly offset
by 15 billion of extra revenues and spending cuts in other
areas.
    Ministers have said about 10 billion euros will be devoted
to 5-Star's flagship policy of a basic income for the poor,
while around 8 billion will finance a lowering of the retirement
age. Less than a billion will go to fund tax cuts for the
self-employed, a project championed in particular by the League.
    After the cabinet approves the budget it will pass to
parliament, where it must be passed before the end of the year.
    Despite international criticism and a sell-off of Italy's
government bonds, the budget is popular with Italians. A survey
by pollster Demopolis on Friday showed 52 percent backed the
plan, compared with 38 percent who gave it the thumbs down.

    By Melanie Burton
    MELBOURNE, Oct 15 (Reuters) - London metal prices eased on
Monday alongside an uptick in the U.S. dollar and as ongoing
global trade tensions cloud the outlook for demand.
    An escalating trade row between China and the United States
could crimp demand for commodities, even though China's
September trade data proved more resilient than expected last
week. 
    The United States sought to make currency a central part of
any solution to the bruising trade fight, keeping the pressure
on Beijing to speed up economic reforms at a gathering of world
policymakers at the weekend who pledged to do more to safeguard
global growth. [nL2N1WU0DQ]
    ""Markets have been worried that they (China) would be badly
hit. The September data shows that they have been navigating
through the tough water well so far,"" broker Argonaut said in a
report.  
    ""While we are confident in copper prices in the mid- to
long-term, short-term copper prices may continue to be plagued
by risk-off sentiment, a rising dollar and escalating U.S.-China
trade wars.""
    
    FUNDAMENTALS
    * COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper <CMCU3> had edged
down 0.2 percent to $6,291 a tonne by 0448 GMT, following a 1
percent gain in the previous session. Prices have traded in a
$6,090-6,400 range for the past three weeks. Copper prices hit a
 13-month trough below $5,800 a tonne in mid-August. 
    * SHFE: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper <SCFcv1> climbed
0.5 percent to 50,740 yuan ($7,335) a tonne.
    * STOCKS: LME copper stocks have dropped since August as
ShFE stocks have climbed, reflecting higher imports to the
world's top metals consumer after a crackdown on waste imports
that cut the availability of scrap metal. <CU-STX-SGH>
   * ""China's restriction of copper scrap imports (is) boosting
demand for use of cathode or other copper products in
smelting/refining,"" Argonaut added. 
    * DOLLAR: The U.S. dollar firmed against the pound and euro
on Monday as British efforts to secure a Brexit deal ahead of a
key European Union summit fanned demand for safe-haven
currencies. [USD/]
    * SPREADS: Illustrating a significant shortfall in near-term
supply, nearby prices to obtain lead and zinc over the next few
months have surged over those further out. <0#MZN:> <0#MPB:>
    * SHFE STOCKS: Zinc spreads are tightening as more metal
arrives in warehouses in China. ShFE warehouse inventories
showed that zinc arrivals jumped by 14,169 tonnes, or 48.5
percent, over the past two weeks to 43,373 tonnes. <ZN-STX-SGH>
    Copper arrivals jumped by 12 percent, or 13,703 tonnes, to
125,700 tonnes. <CU-STX-SGH>]
        
    MARKETS NEWS    
    * Asian shares slipped on Monday as worries over Sino-U.S.
trade disputes, a possible slowdown in the Chinese economy and
higher U.S. borrowing costs tempered optimism despite a rebound
in global equities late last week. [MKTS/GLOB]

in flash floods in the southwestern Aude area of France after
several months worth of rain fell in just a few hours overnight,
the local government prefect said on Monday.
    Rescue helicopters were waiting for clearer weather before
they could launch rescue operations, the prefect of Aude, Alain
Thirion, told BFM TV.
    ""We have people stranded on rooftops. We're going to have to
use aircraft to evacuate them because we cannot reach them by
boat given the force of the water. It's too dangerous,"" he said.
    Among the worst hit areas were the villages of
Conques-sur-Orbiel and Villardonnel, where waters rose as high
as the first-floor windows of some houses.
    The flash floods struck without warning. At least one victim
was swept away by raging waters while sleeping, Thirion said.
    Water levels were expected to continue to rise in the area
on Monday, with rain forecast until late in the morning. Schools
in the Aude area were closed and residents were told to stay at
home.
    Torrential rains are not uncommon in France at this time of
year, but meteorologists have said that exceptionally warm sea
water along the Mediterranean coast of southern France may be
intensifying the rains. 
    The year so far is France's hottest since 1900, according to
the state meteorological service.

    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU in
its biggest shift in trade and foreign policy in more than 40
years, the latest round of talks in Brussels failed to clinch a
deal on Britain's divorce terms, with negotiators pausing
negotiations just days before a leaders' summit. [nL8N1WU0H1]
    The latest round of Brexit talks faltered over the so-called
backstop arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member
Ireland, which the DUP has objected to.
    Wilson said he believed the current offer from the EU was
""far worse"" than a no deal and that it would not secure a
majority in the British parliament. 
    He said, however, that a series of ""mini deals"" could avoid
the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit. 
    ""No deal doesn't mean there will be nothing agreed,"" he
said. ""It probably means there will be a lot of mini agreements
on things which are essential, to keep planes flying, lorries
moving, that sort of thing,"" he said. 
    ""It seems that the EU and the UK are both fairly far
advanced in making preparations for that.""

    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European shares failed to rebound
on Monday after their worst week since a correction in February
as a flurry of threats such as trade wars, rising U.S. yields, a
slowdown in China, Brexit and the Italy/EU budget row continued
to weigh on markets.
    For European bourses there was no wind of optimism from Asia
where stocks suffered as rising diplomatic tensions between

pushed oil higher.

    PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - At least six people were killed in
flash floods in the southwestern Aude district of France after
several months' worth of rain fell in just a few hours
overnight, the local government prefect said on Monday.
    Six helicopters were scrambled to help rescue people from
the roofs of their homes, but bad weather was making operations
difficult, the prefect of Aude, Alain Thirion, told BFM TV.
Around 250 firemen and 100 police were involved in the effort.
    ""We have people stranded on rooftops. We're going to have to
use aircraft to evacuate them because we cannot reach them by
boat given the force of the water. It's too dangerous,"" he said.
    Among the worst hit areas were the villages of
Conques-sur-Orbiel and Villardonnel, where waters rose as high
as the first-floor windows of some houses. The Aude region is
best known for its Medieval fort city of Carcassonne.
    The flash floods struck without warning. At least one victim
was swept away by raging waters while sleeping, Thirion said.
Television pictures showed rivers flowing furiously, having torn
down trees and concrete power pylons, and swept away cars.
    Water levels were expected to continue to rise in the area
on Monday, with rain forecast until late in the morning. Schools
in the area were closed and residents were told to stay at home.
    Torrential rains are not uncommon in France at this time of
year, but meteorologists have said exceptionally warm sea water
along the Mediterranean coast may be intensifying the rains. 
    The year so far is France's hottest since 1900, according to
the state meteorological service.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The yen hit a one-month high and
the Swiss franc gained on Monday as rising geopolitical tension
and investor anxiety about the global economy left investors
skittish at the start of the week. 
    Equity markets fell on worries the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade
dispute is hitting China's economy, while Saudi Arabian shares
tumbled on rising tensions between Riyadh and the West after the
monarchy warned against trying to punish it over disappearance
of a journalist [nL8N1WU0ED].
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies suffered
their worst election result since 1950 on Sunday, in a setback
that raised tensions within the country's crisis-prone national
government [nL8N1WU02P].
    ""I don't think it's a huge political risk, but it does tell
you that political risks in Europe are not going away,"" said
Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst at Societe Generale.
    Tan said the yen and franc, both considered safe-haven
currencies that attract investors when markets are in flux, had
benefited as equity markets dropped, although the moves were not
huge.
    The yen rose as much as half a percent to 111.69 <JPY=>, its
strongest since Sept. 18. The franc also rose versus both the
euro <EURCHF=> and dollar <CHF=>, but the gains were limited.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=>, often seen as a barometer of
global risk sentiment, shrugged off the mood and rose 0.2
percent to $0.7128 against the dollar, suggesting investors were
far from panicked. The Aussie had hit a two-year low of 0.7039
on Oct. 5.
    The euro nudged higher to $1.1571 <EUR=> against the dollar,
while the dollar traded flat against a basket of currencies
<.DXY>.
    Analysts said the euro's fortunes would be determined in
part by the Italian government's annual budget, which the
cabinet is due to approve later on Monday [nL8N1WU0QF].
    
    YEN STRENGTH
    Analysts expect the yen to strengthen as a downturn in
equities catalyzes safe-haven demand for the yen.
    ""Our bias is that equities will remain under pressure this
week, and thus see scope for USD/JPY to ease somewhat further
towards the 110 level,"" a research note from Mizuho Bank said.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that
Washington wants to include a provision to deter currency
manipulation in future trade deals, including with Japan, based
on the currency chapter in the new deal to revamp the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
    Japanese media ran front-page stories questioning whether
that would give Washington the right to label as currency
manipulation any future foreign-exchange market interventions by
Tokyo to curb sharp yen rises.
    Sterling dropped 0.2 percent $1.3121 <GBP=> after warnings
that Brexit talks appear to have hit an impasse. The pound also
fell 0.4 percent against the euro to 88.190 pence <EURGBP=>.

    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Brussels, the political heart
of Europe, could prove the centre of global market focus next
week as Italy's budget and Brexit talks overshadow economic data
and central banks.
    World shares were on course for their worst week since
February as a spike in U.S. bond yields, a U.S.-China trade war
and other global risks have combined to undermine sentiment.
    One such risk is an impending dispute between Italy's
eurosceptic government and the European Union over Rome's 2019
budget plans, which could lead the EU executive to the
unprecedented move of rejecting it.
    Euro zone countries, including Italy, have until Monday to
submit their draft budgetary plans to the European Commission,
winch which would have to warn Rome within a week if it planned
to trigger the rejection process. [nL8N1WR2UJ]
    The populist Italian government plans a deficit of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's
target, prompting investors to sell Italian bonds and pushing
the country's borrowing costs to five-year high at a bond
auction. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    EU leaders meeting in Brussels from Wednesday to Friday are
expected to spend time discussing Italy, even if it is not
formally on the agenda of an exceptional three days of talks
that will also see them meeting around 25 Asian leaders,
including the prime ministers of China and Japan.
    That agenda does include efforts to finalise a withdrawal
deal with Britain.
    Finding a way of ensuring an open border between Ireland and
Northern Ireland post-Brexit has been the main challenge.
    Indications in the past two weeks were that both sides were
inching towards a deal, boosting the pound, although the
stubborn border issue thwarted marathon talks on Sunday.
    Britain and the EU have called a pause in the Brexit
negotiations until leaders of member states meet in Brussels and
it is not clear what those leaders can agree to at a dinner of
27 on Wednesay before British Prime Minister Theresa May joins
them at a regular summit on Thursday. [nL8N1WU0H1]
    ""Now comes the crunch time,"" said economists at Commerzbank,
adding that there was the risk of a sharp correction if
negotiations drag on beyond this week.
    James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said
Italy's budget and Brexit would be in sharp focus in the week
ahead, along with the course of markets themselves.
    ""Are we going to get any calm returning to equity markets?
There's a lot of unsettling concern about the combination of
higher bond yields, geopolitical risk and the ongoing trade
tensions,"" he said.
    
    FED ON TRACK DESPITE TRUMP INVECTIVE
    In terms of data, September retail sales from the United
States are expected to reflect the strength of the world's
largest economy with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, a
49-year low, and wages picking up.
    The sales figures on Monay are seen up 0.5 percent in after
a mere 0.1 percent increase in August, the smallest rise in six
months.
    Such data should confirm the Federal Reserve in its
rate-cutting path, even if U.S. President Donald Trump has
called it crazy. The Fed increased interest rates for a third
time this year at the end of September and is expected to do so
again.
    ""That's going to be keeping the Fed on a rates-hiking and
tightening path, even though there is some concern in financial
markets right now,"" said Knightley.
    The week is set to round off with figures on Chinese
economic growth on Friday. The average forecast for expansion in
the third quarter is 6.6 percent, a shade lower than the 6.7
percent growth in the April-June period. 
    Anything lower than that could indicate that the trade war
with Washington, as well as a slowing property market, could be
dragging down the world's second-largest economy.
    Trade figures from China on Friday showed China's trade
surplus with the United States hit a record high in September.
    The data showed solid expansion in China's overall imports
and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat
tariffs with the United States, though that could provoke a
reaction from Trump. [nL4N1WP28H]

paragraph)
    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Italy is resisting a European
Union push to impose sanctions on states who carry out
cyberattacks, a move that appears in line with Rome's calls to
de-escalate tensions with Russia but that could alienate Italy
from its EU allies. 
    Diplomats said the sanctions plan is meant to strengthen EU
defences and deterrence against cyberattacks, in particular from
Russia, which has been in recent months at the centre of
allegations of elections meddling in various Western states as
well as security breaches conducted through electronic means. 
    But Italy has opposed the idea of a new penalty regime, a
confidential EU document seen by Reuters shows. The plan has
broad support among EU states except for Italy, according to the
document.  
    Italian officials were not immediately available for
comment.
    Italy has repeatedly urged a relaxation of the sanctions
against Russia, which has been the target of a wide range of EU
economic penalties since the 2014 Ukraine crisis.
    This position has been opposed by the large majority of EU
states that have regularly renewed the sanctions regime against
Moscow because of its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and
continuing support for pro-Russian separatist rebels there.
    The proposals for sanctioning cyberattacks were discussed in
meetings this week in preparation for an EU summit that will
take place next week in Brussels.
    ""Responding to large-scale cyberattacks from foreign actors,
in particular when they are aimed at our elections, is vital,""
EU Security Commissioner Julian King told Reuters, adding that
sanctions should be considered ""where appropriate"".
    Britain, France, Estonia, the Netherlands, Romania,
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland called for the
introduction of sanctions, the document shows.
    Belgium, Finland and Sweden support a ""gradual response"" to
future attacks that could include a number of measures before
sanctions, the document shows.
    Rome has long said that existing sanctions are damaging
Italian firms trading with Moscow, and calls for de-escalating
tensions with Moscow have grown louder since a new
anti-establishment government took office in Italy in June. 
    Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's co-ruling far-right
League, is an admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin and
has rejected allegations of Russian meddling in Western
elections.  
    EU diplomats said the plan was also aimed at preventing
cyber-attacks from China and North Korea.

Prime Minister Charles Michel lost ground in local elections,
throwing into doubt whether he will be able to continue his
centre-right coalition after a national vote next year.
    Belgium will hold federal and regional elections on May 26,
the same day as elections held across the European Union for
seats in the European Parliament.
    In Sunday's regional elections, Michel's Mouvement
Reformateur (MR) slipped by around 4 percentage points in all
but one of the provinces in Wallonia, the French-speaking
southern region of Belgium, and lost a number of mayoral posts
in the capital Brussels.
    Michel told broadcaster RTBF that his party had done better
than forecast by opinion polls.
    ""We are relatively stable,"" he said.
    In the Dutch-speaking north of the country, Flanders, the
three parties ruling at national level had mixed results. Bart
De Wever, the leader of the separatist N-VA, was on course to
stay on as mayor of Belgium's second city, Antwerp.
    Federal governments in Belgium result from separate
elections in Flanders and Wallonia. Michel's government, in
power since 2014, is unusual in that it contains only one
French-speaking party and lacks a majority in the south of the
country.
    The local election's big winners, north and south, were the
Greens, with gains also registered by the hard left PTB in
Wallonia and the separatist anti-immigrant Vlaams Belang in
Flanders.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The yen hit a one-month high and
the Swiss franc rallied on Monday as rising geopolitical tension
and further falls in equity markets left investors skittish at
the start of the week. 
    European stocks sunk to 22-month lows amid rising tensions
between Saudi Arabia and the West after the monarchy warned
against trying to punish it for the disappearance of a
journalist critical of its regime.
    That added to a number of concerns for markets globally,
including rising oil prices, the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade dispute
and a humbling election defeat for Chancellor Angela Merkel's
conservative Bavarian allies [nL8N1WU0ED] [nL8N1WV28Z]. 
    Merkel's allies suffered their worst election result since
1950 on Sunday, in a setback that raised tensions within the
country's crisis-prone national government [nL8N1WU02P].
    The euro, however, was little fazed. It rose 0.3 percent to
$1.1592 <EUR=> against the dollar as the greenback sold off
against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. 
    Analysts said the euro's fortunes over the next few days
would be determined in part by the Italian government's annual
budget, which the cabinet is due to approve later on Monday
[nL8N1WU0QF].
    ""I don't think it's (the German election result) a huge
political risk, but it does tell you that political risks in
Europe are not going away,"" said Alvin Tan, a currencies analyst
at Societe Generale.
    The yen rose as much as half a percent to 111.62 <JPY=>, its
strongest since Sept. 13. The Swiss franc, which investors also
tend to buy when markets are in flux, rose 0.4 percent against
the euro <EURCHF=> to 1.1423 francs and 0.6 percent versus the
dollar <CHF=> to 0.9853 francs.
    Valentin Marinov, head of currency strategy at Credit
Agricole, said a ""constellation of political risks"" was weighing
on sentiment and supporting yen and franc buying. 
    However, he said the moves were limited and did not suggest
a ""game changer"" for currency markets, which have remained
relatively calm amid recent equity market sell-offs.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=>, often seen as a barometer of
global risk sentiment, shrugged off the mood and rose 0.3
percent to $0.7141 against the dollar, suggesting investors were
far from panicked. The Aussie had hit a two-year low of 0.7039
on Oct. 5.
    There were also some signs stock markets were calming in
European trading.
    ""While the losses being reported are more modest than those
seen last week, which investors will hope represents some
stability and normality returning to markets, it will remain a
source of concern for now,"" said Craig Erlam, market analyst at
currency broker OANDA. 
    Sterling dropped 0.2 percent $1.3121 <GBP=> after Brexit
talks hit an impasse, before recovering to trade up at $1.3178,
propelled higher by the dollar's weakness [nL8N1WV1ZO].
    The pound fell 0.3 percent against the euro to 88.170 pence
<EURGBP=>.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Euro zone banks have a large
shortfall in their loss-absorbing buffers and now face tougher
market conditions for building them up due to higher volatility
and widening spreads in sovereign yields, the bloc's banking
watchdogs said on Monday.
    Under international and EU banking rules, large banks must
issue special loss-absorbing debt known as TLAC and MREL that
can be converted into capital if a crisis burns through their
core capital buffer.
    ""Not enough progress has been made there,"" the European
Banking Authority's chair Andrea Enria told a banking conference
in Brussels. Enria said the problem concerned large and medium
banks but not the biggest systemically important lenders, like
Deutsche Bank or Unicredit, who are instead ""very close to being
fully complaint.""
    The shortfall stands at 125 billion euros ($145 billion) for
the bloc's 35 most complex banking groups, said Dominique
Laboureix, who is a member of the Single Resolution Board, the
EU body that handles failing banks and sets the level of
loss-absorbing buffers.
    These buffers are for use when a bank is in trouble. They
are seen as crucial to allow an orderly wind-down of a lender,
and should also reduce the cost to taxpayers of any banking
rescue.
    Enria said investors have so far shown interest in buying
this debt but warned that the ""window of opportunity is closing
down"".
    ""Funding markets are not going to be as open and available
as they were until now,"" Enria said, citing increased
volatility, external events, widening sovereign spreads and
concerns on emerging markets as the main reasons for investors'
lower appetite.
    
    BANKS FUND
    A sufficient level of loss-absorbing buffers is required for
banks to be able to access funding from the bloc's fund for
troubled lenders, the Single Resolution Fund (SRF).
    The SRF is expected to hold nearly 33 billion euros ($38
billion) in 2019, up from almost 25 billion this year, Single
Resolution Board chair Elke Koenig said on Monday.
    The board manages the fund, which is financed by euro zone
banks.
   The plan is to gradually increase the fund's holdings to at
least 1 percent of all covered deposits in euro zone banks by
the end of 2023, which is estimated to be between 55 billion and
60 billion euros.
    The fund will then have a backstop to face major banking
crises although the final details are yet to be finalised by
euro zone states.
    EU leaders agreed in June to give the state rescue fund, the
European Stability Mechanism, more powers to help the banking
fund, but its precise powers are expected to be clarified in
December.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Failure to agree a ""backstop""
mechanism on Northern Ireland's land border with the European
Union has thwarted hopes of a Brexit deal this week. This is
what it is and why it matters:
    
    BOTH SIDES WANT TO AVOID A ""HARD BORDER"" - WHAT'S THAT?
    In 1998, Britain and Ireland made the Good Friday agreement
to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland over whether it
should stay British or join the Irish republic to the south.
That ended controls along the 500-km (300-mile) land border and
set up all-Ireland rules and institutions that make Northern
Ireland special within the United Kingdom. Brexit means the
north also leaving the EU, possible new checks along the border
and different trade rules that could inflame tensions once more.
        
    SO THE SOLUTION IS...?
    British Prime Minister Theresa May says a special customs
and trade arrangement with the EU, to be negotiated during a
20-month status-quo transition period, will ensure seamless
borders between the whole of the United Kingdom and EU -- so
there will be no need for intrusive checks on goods at the Irish
border.
    
    THAT SOUNDS FAIR - SO WHAT'S THE CATCH?
    The Irish government, backed by the rest of the EU, wants an
insurance policy in case those future trade talks fail.
    
    AND THAT INSURANCE POLICY IS WHAT?
    Early this year, EU negotiator Michel Barnier proposed that,
if a better solution involving the whole UK is not found before
the end of transition in 2020, Northern Ireland alone would
effectively remain in the EU economic space ""unless and until""
there is a better solution. 
    
    BUT BRITAIN OBJECTS, RIGHT?
    Yes. May and her vital allies in a pro-British Belfast party
reject any trade barriers between two parts of the UK. Northern
Irish unionists fear it would push the province toward a merger
with the republic. Britain suggested applying a backstop customs
deal to the mainland too. Brussels dismissed that as a dodge to
get British goods into the single market by a back door. 

    SO WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WEEKEND?
    EU negotiators tried to take the sting out of the backstop
by stressing it might never be triggered, checks on intra-UK
trade would be discreet and transition could be extended by a
year to Dec. 31, 2021 to give more time to clinch an EU-UK trade
deal which would keep the Irish border fully open anyway.
    British negotiators insisted that a permanent EU-UK customs
arrangement was the answer -- a position EU officials see as
keeping the UK in the EU customs union but using a different
name because May and many of her allies have ruled that out.
    The EU response was that such a customs union is possible
but it can only be negotiated and agreed after Brexit and in any
case not in the next few weeks -- hence the EU demand that a
legally binding backstop in the withdrawal treaty must remain.
    Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab flew in to confirm the impasse
with EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Sunday evening -- and also
raised new problems that EU negotiators thought were settled.
    
    AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
    May is sounding out her allies ahead of a trip to Brussels
from Wednesday to Friday for summits with EU and Asian EU
ministers meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday to prepare the agenda
for a dinner of the other 27 EU leaders in Brussels on
Wednesday. leaders. Barnier will brief them and the leaders,
also taking account of any new signals from May, will take a
view on how best to proceed on Brexit -- notably on whether to
step up talks on future EU-UK trade and on whether to step up
preparations for a ""no deal"".
    Further talks on future relations, intended to agree a
non-binding declaration of intent to accompany the Brexit
treaty, had been conditional on progress on the withdrawal
agreement. Some states, notably France, are arguing that May
must be put under more pressure at the summit to drop her
objections.

    By Giuseppe Fonte and Angelo Amante
    ROME, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Italian cabinet on Monday
signed off on an expansionary 2019 budget, boosting welfare
spending, cutting the retirement age and hiking the deficit to
set up a showdown with authorities in Brussels over compliance
with EU rules.
     The government of the right-wing League and the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement had already issued the
financial framework for the budget, raising the target for next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.
[nL8N1WL29P]
    That is comfortably below the EU's 3 percent ceiling, but up
sharply from a targeted 1.8 percent this year, unnerving
financial markets and contravening EU regulations that call on
Italy and similarly highly indebted countries to narrow the
deficit steadily towards zero.
    So far, the reaction from Brussels has been irate, with EU
commissioners threatening to reject the package before formally
receiving it, and triggering a war of words with Rome.
    The Commission will now assess the fiscal framework - a
separate document from the budget law - over two weeks, and
could dismiss it and ask Rome to draw up a new one. The EU
executive has never taken this step since it was given beefed-up
powers in 2013.
    The League and 5-Star say they will not backtrack, arguing
that their big-spending budget is needed to boost growth and
tackle rising poverty in the euro zone's third largest but most
sluggish economy.
    ""This budget keeps the government's promises while keeping
public accounts in order,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told
reporters after the cabinet meeting, flanked by his top
ministers.
    Its key measures include a basic income for the poor, a
partial amnesty for citizens who settle tax disputes with the
authorities, and tax cuts for the self-employed.
    The Commission says the budget will push up Italy's public
debt which stood at 131 percent of GDP last year, the highest in
the euro zone after Greece's. It rejects Rome's argument that
the package can lower debt by expanding the economy.
    
    FEARS ""UNFOUNDED""
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said he was confident he
could explain to the Commission that Italy needed to raise
spending to offset a slowing economy, and described the 2.4
percent deficit target as ""normal.""
    Italy's fiscal plans have pushed up the yield on Italian
government bonds, raising borrowing costs for state coffers and
creating fears of contagion for the broader euro zone, but Tria
brushed off concerns.
    ""The idea that this budget can blow up Europe is totally
unfounded,"" he said. 
    The 70-year old economics professor, unaffiliated to either
ruling party, had pushed for a lower deficit target but was
overruled by party chiefs, triggering reports that he planned to
resign after the budget is approved by parliament. He denied
this on Monday.
    Five-Star leader and Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio
said the basic income, his party's flagship policy which will
cost some 10 billion euros  ($11.58 billion) next year, will
kick off before the end of March.
    To help fund spending measures, the budget makes life harder
for Italy's struggling banks, reducing the proportion of
interest payments they can deduct from their taxable income.
    While attracting international criticism, the budget is
popular with Italians. A survey by pollster Demopolis on Friday
showed 52 percent backed the plan, compared with 38 percent who
gave it the thumbs down.
    The spread between the yield on Italy's benchmark 10-year
bonds and their German equivalent stood at just over 3 percent
on Monday, broadly stable compared with the end of last week.

    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on
Tuesday as firmer U.S. Treasury yields encouraged investors to
buy the greenback after a recent drop with investors growing
more bullish about its short-term outlook, especially against
emerging market currencies.
    While the dollar has struggled to extend gains against the
euro and the sterling in recent days, it has strengthened
against its emerging market counterparts and pinned the Chinese
yuan to a two-month low.
    ""The dollar's outlook continues to be strong against
emerging market currencies due to more expected U.S. rate hikes
and the trade conflict between the U.S. and China,"" said Piotr
Matys, a currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
    Against a basket of its rivals <=USD>, the dollar rose 0.1 
percent at 95.13. It has fallen 1.2 percent in the last eight
sessions to a three-week low. 
    But an emerging market currency index <.MIEM00000CUS> was
holding near its lowest levels in 1-1/2 years, indicating  the
divergence of the dollar's performance against its peers.
    The euro <EUR=EBS> remained broadly on the back foot,
holding around $1.1573 against the greenback after the Italian
cabinet on Monday signed off on an expansionary 2019 budget to
set up a showdown with authorities in Brussels over compliance
with EU rules. [nL8N1WW1AI]
    The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D3> advanced 0.24 percent versus
the U.S. one to trade at 0.6567 as the domestic inflation rate
was higher than expected in the third quarter. [nL8N1WV068]
    The Japanese yen <JPY=> weakened by 0.19 percent on Tuesday
and changed hands at 111.97. The yen had hit a one-month high of
111.61 on Monday.
    The Swiss franc <CHF=> weakened 0.17 percent versus the
dollar to trade at 0.9886 on Tuesday, after tacking on 0.45
percent overnight.
    Sterling was broadly steady at a one-week low as Brexit
negotiations faltered before a crucial European Union summit
this week. [nL8N1WV551]

trade at 75.93 versus the euro <EURRUBTN=MCX>.
    The Russian currency got support from local tax payments for
the month of October, which came due on Monday. To meet the
duties, export-focused companies usually convert their foreign
currency revenues into roubles.

main export, was down 0.27 percent at $80.56 a barrel.

    BUDAPEST, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's government debt yield
curve is the steepest in at least 14 years as markets are
pricing in fears that the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) may not
give up its loose monetary stance in time to tackle rising
inflation.
    The central bank, which decides on interest rates later on
Tuesday, is expected to keep Central Europe's lowest rates on
hold this year. Some analysts expect a hike next year.
[nL8N1WS39D]
    As global sentiment soured, a jump in the U.S. 10-year
Treasury yield <US10YT=RR> has led to a surge in Hungary's
corresponding yield <HU10YT=RR>. 
    The spread between Hungary's 3-month Treasury bill yield,
<HU3MT=RR> which is at -0.01 percent, and its 10-year bond yield
approached 4 percentage points last week.
    ""Any negative turn in the interest rate environment (in
global markets) hits the long end as the NBH keeps short-term
rates low,"" one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.
    ""The curve has never been as steep as now,"" the trader
addded. ""Market confidence that the NBH will react in time (to a
rise in inflation) is lost.""
    The NBH declined to comment.
    It revamped its toolkit in September to prepare for starting
a tightening of monetary conditions, but stopped short of saying
when this could start.
    ""After the 20bp increase of 10Y yields in Hungary
experienced last week... one might wonder for how long this
ultra-dovish monetary policy is sustainable,"" Erste Group
analysts said in a note.
    The long-term yield rose above annual inflation, which ran
at 3.6 percent in September, but short-term interest rates kept
down by liquidity from the NBH's fx swaps facilities, remain
well below inflation.
    That keeps local assets, mainly long-end bonds, more
vulnerable than in other markets such as regional peer Poland
where interest rates are higher, market participants said.
    Headline annual inflation has approached the top of the
bank's 2-4 percent target range in the past months, but core
inflation stayed at 2.4 percent in September.
    Analysts said inflation does not yet worry the bank, which
will discuss its next inflation report in December.    
    The latest Hungarian bond auctions <HUAUCTION02>, held on
Thursday, drew robust demand due to the yield surge. Any further
rise may make the papers attractive, Raiffeisen analyst Stephan
Imre said in a note.
    But any inflation surprise, including a possible surge in
core inflation over 3 percent early next year, could hit local
markets again, ING analyst Peter Virovacz said.
    Surging energy and wage costs and a weakening of the forint
<EURHUF=> against the euro this year may prompt companies to
increase their prices, potentially surprising the NBH, he said.
    ""It is a real risk that there will be a big repricing in
markets in January,"" Virovacz said.
    ""The market seriously questions whether the NBH is right in
its inflation forecasts... (Investors) do not believe that the
bank keeps inflation under control,"" he added.

    Keeping up a consensus among the EU27 was in Britain's

the official added.

buses and engines, said it hadn’t completed a full analysis of
the issue but the costs of fixing the problem ""could be
material"".

sold in North America and Europe, the company said.

    MOSCOW, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
has tentative plans to visit Russian-backed Crimea in April 2019
and is in talks about starting regular passenger flights between
Syria and the Black Sea peninsula, Russian news agencies said on
Tuesday.   
    Crimea has been under Western sanctions since it was annexed
from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Syria is also subject to
European Union and U.S. sanctions. 
    The Russian agencies cited members of a Crimean delegation
visiting Syria this week, which includes the Moscow-backed prime
minister of Crimea Sergei Aksyonov. [nL8N1WV0XO]
    Syrian state news agency SANA said Syrian and Crimean
officials had agreed to create a Syrian Trading House in Crimea
and a joint maritime transport company. They also agreed to
facilitate financial and banking measures.
    ""Crimea is the nearest Black Sea port and therefore can play
an important role in the bilateral trade between Syria and 
Crimea, and between Syria, Crimea and Russia,"" SANA reported,
quoting a statement by Syrian Economy Minister Samer Khalil. 
    Russia is an ally of Assad in Syria's seven-year long
conflict. The leaders of two other Russian-backed breakaway
regions, Georgia's South Ossetia and Abkhazia, also visited
Damascus this year. [nL8N1VQ5MH]

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - German investor morale darkened
more than expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as
concerns about an escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute and Britain
crashing out of the EU without a divorce deal clouded the
outlook for Europe's largest economy.
    The ZEW research institute's monthly survey showed economic
sentiment among investors deteriorated to -24.7 from -10.6 in
September.
    This undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a smaller
drop to -12.0. The indicator reached the same low-point as in
July, the lowest reading since August 2012.
    ""Expectations for the German economy are dampening above all
due to the intensifying trade dispute between the USA and
China,"" ZEW researcher Achim Wambach said.
    ""A further negative influence on economic and export
expectations is the danger of a 'hard Brexit', which is becoming
ever more likely.""
    The United States and China are in a bruising tit-for-tat
tariffs dispute that threatens to hurt global growth as well as
""innocent bystander"" nations, IMF Managing Director Christine
Lagarde has said. [nL2N1WR05V]
    British Prime Minister Theresa May's speech to parliament on
Monday showed that reaching a deal on the country's exit from
the European Union will be even harder than expected, a senior
EU official said on Tuesday. [nL8N1WW2GA]
    A separate ZEW gauge measuring investors' assessment of the
economy's conditions fell to 70.1 from 76.0 in the previous
month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for 74.5.
    Wambach pointed to political uncertainty at home as another
factor behind the growing pessimism among German investors.
    ""The situation of the governing coalition in Berlin is
perceived to have become more unstable, which also weighs on
economic sentiment,"" he said.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Monday to restore
trust in her government after the Bavarian sister party of her
conservatives suffered heavy losses in a regional election.  
[nL8N1WV211]
    The German economy is expected to have shifted into a lower
gear over the summer months, but the economy ministry has said
it expected growth to pick up again in the fourth quarter.
    For the full year, the government has lowered its growth
forecast to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent previously as trade
tensions abroad and a lack of skilled workers at home limit the
room for economic expansion. [nL8N1WR30F]
    The government has also blamed slower production in the auto
sector due to difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard
- the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).

    ROME, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italy has introduced a more
punitive and costly regime for tax losses that banks can book on
loan writedowns, according to the Italian budget.
    The document, seen on Tuesday, said the tax deductibility on
writedowns under the recently introduced IFRS9 accounting rule
will now be spread over 10 years rather than just one.
    It also said a 10 percent tax deduction rate on bank loan
losses for corporate and regional tax purposes had now been put
back to the end of 2026.
    In its 2019 budget, the government cuts tax benefits for
banks and insurance companies to raise money for higher welfare
spending and tax cuts in other areas.
    On Monday, the cabinet signed off on a 2019 budget that
widened its deficit, setting up a showdown with Brussels over
compliance with European Union rules.
    ""Compared to the peak of net bad loans reached in November
2015 of 88.9 billion euros the reduction, of 48.7 billion, has
been significant,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on
Tuesday.
    Italy's banks have spent years rebuilding their balance
sheets and reducing bad loans that had threatened to cripple
them.
    The budget document also tightened the screws on advanced
taxes that insurance companies have to pay on premiums. They
will have to pay in advance 75 percent of taxes on premiums in
2019 compared with the previous 59 percent.
    That rate will rise to 90 percent in 2020 from a previous 74
percent and to 100 percent as of 2021.
    ""We need to be very careful to dealing with these issues...
because we are one of the pillars of the national system,"" the
chairman of Italy's biggest insurer, Generali <GASI.MI>, was
cited by Italian news agencies as saying on Tuesday.
    Italy's coalition government, made up of the right-wing
League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has
said the budget will include no tax increases other than those
on banks and insurance companies.

    By Christopher Thompson
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s not often one
imagines Jamie Dimon with a halo over his coiffured head. But
that, in effect, is what European banks have given the JPMorgan
<JPM.N>  boss by dithering over whether to attend the Future
Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia next week. The accusation
that Riyadh had engaged in state-sponsored murder left all
attendees facing the awkward choice of whether to bail and
potentially miss out on fat fees, or go and risk pariah status.
    Having decided to pass, following the disappearance of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dimon occupies what passes for the
moral high ground. European bank bosses have been left with an
even worse choice – pull out because everyone else has, or risk
looking even more morally dubious. HSBC <HSBA.L>, <0005.HK>  CEO
John Flint, Standard Chartered’s <STAN.L>  Bill Winters and
Credit Suisse’s <CSGN.S>  Tidjane Thiam have gone for the
former: they said on Tuesday they would no longer attend.
    The fact that French lenders Société Générale <SOGN.PA>  and
BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>  have remained conspicuously silent
illustrates the moral and commercial quandary European lenders
find themselves in. Having been bested in their own backyard by
U.S. peers – bar Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, the top five biggest
investment banks by revenue in Europe are all American,
according to Coalition data – and shut out by U.S. sanctions of
other markets like Iran, the conference organised by Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman now offers a rare opportunity to
steal a march on their transatlantic rivals.
    HSBC, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole
<CAGR.PA>  and Société Générale are among the top 12 biggest
investment banking earners in Saudi this year, according to
Refinitiv data. True, the collective $79 million in year-to-date
fees may be small beer compared to much bigger home markets. But
the reform drive pledged by MbS, including the touted stock
market listing of oil company Saudi Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE>,
various privatisations and overseas acquisitions of the Saudi
sovereign wealth fund, promised much fatter paydays for Europe’s
assorted rainmakers.
    Still, given JPMorgan has topped the Saudi investment
banking fees table this year and last, Dimon has taken the
principled response. Thiam, Blackstone <BX.N>  chief Steve
Schwarzman and others who remain on the FII advisory board
occupy a middle ground. As for the French, they better make sure
they get some lucre to offset the reputational hit.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The bosses of HSBC, Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered
have cancelled their attendance at a Saudi Arabian investor
event next week, bank spokespeople told Breakingviews on Oct.
16. French banks BNP Paribas and Société Générale have yet to
make a final decision, according to people familiar with
discussions.
    - The decision on the summit in Riyadh, called the Future
Investment Initiative, come after JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon cancelled on Oct. 14.
    - Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post
columnist critical of Riyadh’s policies, disappeared on Oct. 2
after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes
he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied
that.

    BUDAPEST, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank (NBH)
kept its key interest rates on hold at record lows on Tuesday,
in the face of market concerns about recent rises in inflation.
[nL8N1WV4DA]
    Central Europe's most dovish central bank left its base rate
at 0.9 percent and its overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent
<NBHI>, both in line with the median forecasts of analysts in a
Reuters poll. [nL8N1WS39D]
    At 1202 GMT, the forint <EURHUF=D3> traded at 322 versus the
euro, a touch weaker than 321.83 before the announcement. 
    The bank has stuck to its dovish stance even as some other
central banks in Central Europe started raising interest rates.
    It revamped its policy tools in September to prepare for a
gradual policy normalisation but stopping short of saying when
this could start.
    Headline inflation picked up to 3.6 percent in September
from 3.4 percent in August, the highest rate since January 2013,
but still within the NBH's 2 to 4 percent target range.
    ""Following a significant upward surprise in the September
inflation release relative to the NBH's forecasts, the key issue
... is the extent to which the NBH acknowledges this surprise
and its significance for monetary policy,"" analysts at Goldman
Sachs said in a note.
    ""Our expectation is that it is likely to acknowledge the
data but that it will defer any discussion of its policy
implications for now."" The central bank is due to issue a
statement an hour after its decision, at about 1300 GMT.
    Although the September inflation figures were within the
target range, the NBH also needs to watch central bankers in the
United States, the euro zone and the region.
    A rise in interest rates elsewhere can weaken the forint if
Hungarian interest rates stay low, which can generate additional
inflation and more forint weakness.
    The central bank expects to meet its 3 percent policy target
in a sustainable manner by the middle of next year.
    Some analysts expect the base rate to start to rise from 0.9
percent next year, but their median forecasts show an unchanged
rate for the end of 2019, before a rise to 1.5 percent in 2020.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has
reached a preliminary decision to revoke the licence of Malta's
Pilatus Bank after its chairman was charged with money
laundering, two ECB officials told Reuters, though legal hurdles
remain.
    The bank was accused of processing corrupt payments for the
Azeri and Maltese leadership by investigative journalist Daphne
Caruana Galizia, who was killed a year ago by a car bomb in
Malta [nL3N1S04HM](https://tinyurl.com/yd8nmmap).
 
    Serious gaps have since been found in the supervision of
Pilatus, but the limited options open to the ECB and European
Union regulators in this case and others over the past year have
served to demonstrate the bloc's weak legal framework for
countering money laundering.
    The ECB's supervisory board has already agreed to withdraw
the bank's licence, one ECB official told Reuters, but the
decision will be finalised only after some legal issues are
resolved.
    A second ECB source confirmed that the process of revoking
the bank's licence is under way but was more cautious on its
outcome until legal hurdles are overcome.
    Neither source clarified what legal issues the ECB is facing
to withdraw Pilatus Bank's licence, a move that many observers
had taken for granted after the Malta Financial Services
Authority (MFSA) recommended the withdrawal in June. 
    Reuters tried to contact Pilatus Bank several times but was
unable to talk to a bank representative. A spokeswoman for the
ECB declined to comment.
    Only after the murder of Caruana Galizia in October 2017,
for which there is no proven link to the reports she wrote about
the bank, did the EU begin investigating the Pilatus case.
    The Maltese took no action until the Iranian chairman of the
bank, Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad, was arrested in the United States
in March this year on charges of money laundering and sanctions
violation.
    After that arrest, the MFSA Maltese banking supervisor froze
the assets of the bank and recommended the withdrawal of its
licence.
    
    EU RESPONSE
    The EU has become engulfed in recent months by a rash of
banking scandals over suspected money laundering, involving
Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> and Latvia's ABLV among
others.[nL8N1WO4B0]
    Other cases have received less media coverage, such as a
Spanish investigation into the Luxembourg-headquartered
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which is accused
of having laundered hundreds of millions of euros through its
branch in Madrid [nL5N1LS3CB].
    Luxembourg fined the bank 8.9 million euros ($10.3 million)
last year, legal sources told Reuters, but a loophole in EU
anti-money laundering rules allowed the Duchy to avoid
disclosure despite international guidelines that recommend
publication of sanctions as a key measure to help prevent
financial crime.  
    Other loopholes in EU rules allowed the Maltese MFSA to
grant Pilatus Bank a banking licence in January 2014. 
    That triggered an investigation by the European Banking
Authority last year, but the watchdog was forced to halt
inquiries last month because EU rules are too vague and ""make it
difficult to conclude that there have been breaches of clear and
unconditional obligations"", the agency's chairman, Andria Enria,
told EU lawmakers in a letter seen by Reuters.
    These rules are not expected to change soon.
    The European Commission, which is in charge of proposing EU
legislation, has ruled out immediate changes to money laundering
rules after several reforms in recent years.
   The EU executive has instead proposed a limited overhaul of
the bloc's banking supervision, giving the EBA more powers to
investigate suspicious cases. However, the measures face
opposition from some EU states, led by Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, according to a confidential EU document seen by
Reuters. [nL8N1WI2C6]

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italy is set to introduce a more
punitive tax regime for banks, piling further pressure on a
sector that is suffering due to a spike in the country's debt
costs under a populist government.
    The Italian cabinet on Monday signed off on an expansionary
2019 budget, boosting welfare spending, cutting the retirement
age and hiking the deficit. [nL8N1WV1L6]
    The government's plans have frightened off holders of
Italy's 2-trillion euro debt, pushing the risk premium benchmark
10-year bonds pay over safer German Bunds to 3 percentage points
up from 1.3 in mid-May when the proposed measures first emerged.
[nL8N1WW1CU]
    Domestic government bonds account for 10 percent of Italian
banks' assets and lenders have seen their capital buffers eroded
by the falling value of their sovereign holdings.
    The ruling coalition comprising the anti-establishment 5
Star Movement and far right League is now looking to raise 3.3
billion euros in additional revenues from lenders next year. 
    The budget law spreads over a period of 10 years the
possibility for banks to deduct from their taxable income losses
booked under the IFRS9 accounting rule.
    The rule, which came into force in January, requires lenders
to book expected, and no longer just actual, losses on the value
of their assets. 
    Italian banks stepped up writedowns of soured debts under
the new rule in the first quarter to speed a clean-up of their
balance sheets following a deep recession that ended in 2014.
    The budget also said a 10 percent tax deduction rate on loan
losses for corporate and regional tax purposes had now been put
back to the end of 2026.
    Giovanni Razzoli, a banking analyst at Milan-based broker
Equita, estimated such a measure would slightly erode banks'
capital buffers and hurt their cash reserves but not their
earnings. 
    A government source told Reuters on Monday that banks may
also be prevented from deducting in full from their taxable
income interest paid introducing an 86 percent cap - in a hit to
banks' earning which Equita's Razzoli estimated at 4 percent.
    However, a Treasury source on Tuesday said such measure
could be replaced by others still under study.
    The budget document also tightened the screws on advanced
taxes that insurance companies have to pay on premiums. They
will have to pay in advance 75 percent of taxes on premiums in
2019 compared with the previous 59 percent.
    That rate will rise to 90 percent in 2020 from a previous 74
percent and to 100 percent as of 2021.
    ""We need to be very careful to dealing with these issues ...
because we are one of the pillars of the national system,"" the
chairman of Italy's biggest insurer, Generali <GASI.MI>, was
cited by Italian news agencies as saying on Tuesday.

 (Adds Turkish official, Lindsey Graham)
    By Leah Millis and Osman Orsal
    RIYADH/ISTANBUL, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown
prince agreed on Tuesday there must be a thorough investigation
into the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the United
States said, after media reports that Riyadh will acknowledge
his death in a botched interrogation.
    Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and leading critic of the crown
prince, vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul
on Oct. 2. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered
there and his body removed, which the Saudis strongly deny.
    Overnight, Turkish crime scene investigators entered the
consulate for the first time since Khashoggi's disappearance 
and searched the premises for more than nine hours.
    U.S. President Donald Trump, who dispatched Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh amid strained ties with its close
ally, speculated that ""rogue killers"" may be responsible.
    Pompeo met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
in Riyadh to discuss the incident, which has caused
international outrage and brought renewed attention on the
authoritarian kingdom's human rights record.
    He and Prince Mohammed ""agreed on the importance of a
thorough, transparent, and timely investigation"", U.S. State
Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in Washington.
[nL8N1WW07X]
    ""The Secretary reiterated the President's concern with
respect to Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance, as well as the
President's desire to determine what happened,"" she said.
    Pompeo is expected to go on to Turkey after dinner with the
crown prince.
 
    PAINTING OVER
    In Istanbul, Turkish investigators were expanding their
search to include the residence of the Saudi consul and
consulate vehicles, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. 
    Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan raised the possibility that
parts of the consulate had been repainted since Khashoggi
disappeared.
    ""The investigation is looking into many things such as toxic
materials and those materials being removed by painting them
over,"" he told reporters.
    A Turkish security official said no conclusive evidence
emerged from the overnight search that indicated Khashoggi was
killed in the consulate.
    ""However, there are some findings and they are being worked
on,"" he said, adding that painting may have damaged some
evidence. ""These can't be fully erased after all, so the teams
will continue to work on this.""
    Despite the outcry, the case poses a dilemma for the United
States, Britain and other Western nations. Saudi Arabia is the
world's top oil exporter and spends lavishly on Western arms. It
is also a military ally and an opponent of Iran. 
    Riyadh has also faced criticism from some Western
politicians and human right groups over the civilian casualties
its war planes have caused in the war in Yemen, in which it
intervened three years ago.
    Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it turns out
Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, but ruled out cancelling
arms deals worth tens of billions of dollars.
    Indicating unease over the Khashoggi case, international
media and business executives are pulling out of an investment
conference next week. 
    HSBC <HSBA.L> CEO John Flint joined the list on Tuesday
[nL9N1SG00B], as did the CEOs of Standard Chartered <STAN.L> and
Credit Suisse <CSGN.S>. Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra
told the Dutch parliament he most likely would not attend. 
    Saudi Arabia has said it would retaliate against any
pressure or economic sanctions.
    
    COLLECTING EVIDENCE
    CNN said on Monday that after denying for two weeks any role
in his disappearance, Saudi Arabia was preparing to say he died
in a botched interrogation. 
    The New York Times said Prince Mohammed had approved an
interrogation or abduction of Khashoggi and the government would
shield him by blaming an intelligence official. Saudi
authorities could not be reached for comment.
    Turkish authorities have an audio recording indicating that
Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, Turkish sources have told
Reuters, and shared evidence with countries including Saudi
Arabia and the United States.[nL8N1WV4NO]
    The Turkish team that searched the consulate took away soil
samples and a metal door from the garden, a Reuters witness
said, but a senior official acknowledged the difficulty of
collecting evidence 13 days after the incident.
    
    ""WRECKING BALL""
    Khashoggi moved to Washington last year fearing retribution
for his criticism of Prince Mohammed, who has cracked down on
dissent with arrests.
    Many members of the U.S. Congress, which has long had a
testy relationship with Saudi Arabia, have issued strong
criticism of the kingdom. 
    Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, describing himself as a
long-time supporter of Riyadh, called Prince Mohammed ""a
wrecking ball"" and accused him of Khashoggi's killing.
    ""This guy’s gotta go,"" he said on Fox News.
    The Saudi riyal <SAR=>, rebounded early after falling to its
lowest in two years over fears that foreign investment could
shrink. Saudi stock index <.TASI> initially dropped 3 percent
before recovering to gain 1.3 percent. [nL8N1WW0RY] [nL8N1WW1MA]

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Paris-October 16: Fitch Ratings has upgraded two tranches of FCT 
Ginkgo Compartment Sales Finance 2015-1and affirmed one tranche, as follows:

Class B notes upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable

Class C notes upgraded to 'AA+sf' from 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable

Class A notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable

FCT Ginkgo Compartment Sales Finance 2015-1 is a securitisation of French 
unsecured consumer loans originated in France by CA Consumer Finance (CACF; 
A+/Stable/F1). The securitised portfolio consists of loans advanced to 
individuals for home equipment, recreational vehicles, new vehicles and used 
vehicles.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Increasing Credit Enhancement

Since closing, credit enhancement for the class A notes, provided by the 
subordination of the class B, C and D notes and the general reserve, has 
increased to 43.7% from 25.0% (as of August 2018). Credit enhancement for the 
class B notes has increased to 33.2% from 19 % and for the class C notes to 
23.8% from 13.6%.

Satisfactory Asset Performance

The rating actions reflect the good performance of the underlying receivables. 
Since inception, the transaction's performance in terms of defaults has been in 
line with or better than Fitch's expectations. The cumulative default level was 
2.1% as at  end-August 2018 compared with 1.3% in September 2017.

Significant Level of Excess Spread

The transaction has benefited in the past few months from a significant level of 
gross excess spread (5.5% on average since closing in December 2015), which has 
been sufficient to cover all defaults to date.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

 

The transaction has been tested to determine the rating impact of a combined 25% 
increase in defaults together with a 25% decrease in recoveries. The expected 
impacts are as follows:

FCT Ginkgo Compartment Sales Finance 2015-1

Class A recommended rating: 'AAAsf'; expected impact: 'AAAsf'

Class B recommended rating: 'AAAsf'; expected impact: 'AA+sf'

Class C recommended rating: 'AA+sf'; expected impact: 'A+sf'

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has 
received about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There were 
no findings that affected the rating analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the 
results of any third-party assessment of the asset-portfolio information or 
conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring.

Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party 
assessment conducted on the asset-portfolio information and concluded that there 
were no findings that affected the rating analysis.

Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted 
sample of CA Consumer Finance's origination files and found the information 
contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the 
originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the 
agency about the asset portfolio.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's 
rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that 
it is adequately reliable.

maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast 
information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and 
underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch 
conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it 
in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification 
of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are 
available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's 
factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of 
relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its 
advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as 
audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, 
the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources 
with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the 
issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports 
should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any 
third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on 
in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the 
report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. 
This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or 
sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals 
identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible 
for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes 
only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute 
for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer 
and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be 
changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the 
adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular 
investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to 
any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 
(or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or 
dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to 
use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed

    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Britain's financial sector
brushed off Brexit uncertainty in 2017 to attract more inward
investment than eight rival centres vying for its business, the
City of London Corporation said on Wednesday.
    The body that governs the capital's historic ""Square Mile""
financial district said in a report that London secured 55
inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in financial
services last year, compared with 26 each for Dublin and Paris,
24 in Frankfurt, and 20 in New York.
    Top investors came from the United States, Sweden and China,
while investments from the United States, Germany and Sweden
created the biggest number of jobs, the report said.
    Britain received 392 inbound FDI projects between 2013 and
2017, with the overseas investors investing 8.6 billion pounds 
($11.3 billion) and creating an estimated 16,126 jobs, the
report said. 
    However, it added London was ranked second, behind
Singapore, in terms of capital investment between 2013 and 2017,
with 4.23 billion pounds compared with 4.73 billion pounds for
the Asian financial centre.   
    Britain's planned departure from the European Union next
March has prompted banks, insurers and asset managers that use
London as a gateway to the EU market to open new EU hubs in
Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Luxembourg and Amsterdam.
    ""The UK leads the world when it comes to exporting financial
services and we have a number of strengths that appeal to
investors,"" said Catherine McGuinness, City of London policy
chair.
    “We cannot, however, afford to take this position for
granted. Foreign investment flows can shift quickly so it is
vital that we secure a positive Brexit deal that provides
confidence and clarity for the sector.""
    The EU is the biggest export market for Britain's financial
services sector, and so far there is no clarity on the country's
 future trading relations with the bloc.
    Financial services attracted more than double the FDI of any
other sector in Britain in 2016, the City's report said.
    Last month, New York overtook London as the world's most
attractive financial centre, according to the latest Z/Yen
global financial centres index. [nL5N1VY24F]
    So far the tally of financial jobs that have moved from
London to new EU ""Brexit"" hubs has been far lower than initial
forecasts after Britain voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.

UK will need a longer transition period to make a free-trade

    * Accounting standards board to meet next week

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Insurers from across the world
have called for amendments and a two-year delay to a change in
accounting rules aimed at increasing visibility of how they earn
their money.
    Nine national and regional insurance industry bodies from
Europe, Canada, Korea, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa
want the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
amend and delay its ""IFRS 17"" book-keeping rule by two years to
January 2023.
    Twenty years in the making, the rule seeks to make it easier
for investors to compare how much insurers earn from policies by
prising open a ""black box"" of opaque national practices. IASB
rules are used in over 100 countries, though the United States
has its own accounting standards.
    The industry bodies said in a letter to the IASB that
preparatory work has confirmed that a number of important issues
need to be resolved to make the new rule practical.
    ""As a result, we strongly believe a two-year delay in the
effective date of the standard is required,"" the letter to IASB
chair Hans Hoogervorst said.
    ""There is no expectation that a delay will result in
insurers stopping or slowing their implementation project.""
    The CFO Forum of chief financial officers from major
European insurers like Allianz, Aviva, Generali and Axa has said
the new rule leads to inconsistent reporting, and requirements
that are unnecessarily complex.
    Implementation costs range from 50 million euros to 320
million euros per CFO Forum member, it said, with ongoing
operational costs expected to be significantly greater than for
applying existing insurance book-keeping rules.
    The IASB board will discuss staff reports about a potential
delay and amendments next week, but no decision is expected at
that time.
    ""In determining what amendments, if any, to make to IFRS 17,
the board will need to balance the potential benefit of any
amendments against the effect of an undue delay to a standard
that is needed to address many inadequacies in the existing wide
range of insurance accounting practices,"" an IASB staff paper
for the meeting said.

    By Wayne Cole
    SYDNEY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Asian equities got some welcome
relief on Wednesday after upbeat U.S. earnings reports drove a
rebound on Wall Street and helped restore a little faith in
emerging market stocks and currencies.
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> galloped out of the gates with a 
rise of 1.7 percent, but still has a way to go to recoup the
past week's losses.  
    ""The Nikkei appears to have bottomed out,"" said Soichiro
Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments.
    ""The latest tumble was not driven by convincing factors -
the market may have needed to adjust after its sharp rally and
upcoming corporate earnings should provide evidence of solid
economic fundamentals.""
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> added 0.7 percent and South Korea <.KS11> 1.2
percent, while spreadbetters pointed to opening gains for the
major European bourses.
    Chinese blue chips, however, lagged with a gain of only 0.2
percent <.CSI300> and threatened to sour the mood.
    On Wall Street, the three major indexes had tallied their
biggest one-day percentage gains since March. The Dow <.DJI>
jumped 2.17 percent, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> climbed 2.15
percent and the Nasdaq <.IXIC> 2.89 percent. [.N]
    Netflix Inc <NFLX.O> shot 12 percent higher after the close
as its results far outstripped market expectations with 7
million streaming customers added. [nL3N1WW5AY]
    The blockbuster outcome sent shares of Alphabet Inc
<GOOGL.O>, Facebook Inc <FB.O> and Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> up
about 1 percent in extended trade. 
    The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth
companies that in recent months has lost some of its momentum
following market-leading gains in recent years.
    ""Most have blamed last week's volatility spike on the
systematic funds liquidating positions, as the short volatility
trade unwound rapidly,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at
broker Peppertsone.
    ""This, in turn, has allowed traders to re-focus away from
the macro towards micro, and, predictably, solid U.S. corporate
earnings.""
    The U.S. economic news was also robust, notably a sharp rise
in job openings to a fresh all-time high. [nL2N1WV1CF]
    
    MY BIGGEST THREAT
    All this cheer favoured beaten-down currencies in emerging
markets while taking some steam out of the safe-haven yen. The
MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index rose for a third straight
session <.MIEM00000CUS>.
    The latest survey of global fund managers by BofA Merrill
Lynch found they saw emerging market currencies as the most
undervalued ever against the U.S. dollar.
    The dollar itself was up on the yen at 112.35 <JPY=> but
flat on the euro at $1.1570 <EUR=>. Against a basket of
currencies, the dollar idled at 95.123 <.DXY> having touched a
two-week trough overnight.
    Not helping the dollar was fresh criticism of the Federal
Reserve from U.S. President Donald Trump, who told Fox Business
Network: ""My biggest threat is the Fed.""
    Trump has recently castigated the central bank for raising
interest rates.
    ""While such name calling shouldn't mean anything in terms of
what the Fed actually does, it is a factor which somewhat
undermines sentiment towards the dollar,"" said Ray Attrill, head
of FX strategy at NAB.
    ""It's a contributory factor, albeit minor, to recent poor
performance of the U.S. dollar.""
    Minutes of the last Fed meeting are due out later Wednesday
and expected to show policy makers remain committed to further
gradual tightening. [nL1N1V80QR]
    In commodity markets, gold held at $1,221.11 <XAU=> and just
short of recent 11-week highs.
    Oil prices edged up as industry data showed a surprise
decline in U.S. crude inventories. There was also a risk that
crude supply from the Middle East could be disrupted by looming
U.S. sanctions on Iran and growing tensions with top exporter
Saudi Arabia. [O/R] [nL8N1WV2J2]
    U.S. crude rose 9 cents to $72.01 <CLc1>, while Brent crude
<LCOc1> added 4 cents to $81.45 a barrel.

cementing ties between Switzerland and the European Union, its
biggest trading partner, appeared to fade on Wednesday as four
years of negotiations failed to produce a breakthrough by the
EU's mid-October deadline.
    The talks are complicated by Britain's separate negotiations
on divorce terms from the European Union, with the Commission
loath to be too soft on the Swiss for fear of providing
ammunition to Brexiteers. [nL8N1WW73K]
    ""I can honestly say I find it difficult to believe that the
government will be able to present by year's end a solution to
all the open questions,"" Petra Goessi, leader of the
pro-business Liberals party in the four-party cabinet, told the
Neue Zuercher Zeitung paper.
    ""Switzerland is not yet ready"" for a treaty, she added in an
interview published on Wednesday.
    Swiss labour rules to protect high wages from cross-border
competition have been a major bone of contention with Brussels,
which has been pushing to wrap up an accord by year-end.
[nL8N1WE4JS] [nL8N1WC1TY]
    Talks seemed deadlocked after a meeting of top negotiators
in Brussels on Tuesday.
    ""Some progress was made but we saw no breakthrough. Major
political issues remain open. It is in this light that the
European Commission will now have to assess at political level
how to proceed,"" a Commision spokeswoman said.
    Brussels has been heaping pressure on non-member Switzerland
to agree a pact that would sit atop an existing patchwork of 120
sectoral accords and have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to
single market rules.
    It would focus on five areas linked to the single market:
the free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport,
mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm
goods.
    The treaty would also provide a more effective platform to
resolve disputes, providing greater legal certainty. 
    Should treaty talks fail, and time is short ahead of
elections in Switzerland and for the European Parliament both
due next year, the sectoral accords would stay in effect, but
two-way ties would enter a deep freeze.
    Failure to strike a deal would mean no increase in Swiss
access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity
union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for
Swiss makers of products such as medical devices, if pacts on
mutual recognition of standards lapse.
    The Commission has threatened not to extend beyond this year
recognition of Swiss stock exchange rules that allow
cross-border trading, which could touch off tit-for-tat
escalation. [nL8N1WB57A]

 central bank poll data

    ISTANBUL, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Turkish economic growth is
expected to fall short of sharply lowered government forecasts
this year and next, with a recession now likely in the coming
six months, a Reuters poll showed, underscoring serious damage
from a currency crisis.
    The lira <TRYTOM=D3> has collapsed nearly 40 percent this
year, pushing up the price of everything from food to fuel and
sending annual inflation to nearly 25 percent, its highest in 15
years. 
    Sparked by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's control
over monetary policy, the sell-off has prompted the central bank
to hike rates aggressively, although not enough to reverse the
lira's losses. Investors are now worried about slowing output
and the potential impact on the banking sector.
    The economy will expand 3.3 percent this year and just 1.1
percent next year, according to a poll of 46 economists. That is
well below the government's lowered forecasts of 3.8 percent
growth for this year and 2.3 percent in 2019 announced by
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak last month.
    ""The Turkish central bank's sharp monetary tightening is set
to put an additional brake on economic expansion in the
long-term,"" analysts at Danske Bank wrote in a recent note.
    ""We see that risks of recession during the next 12 months
have notably increased.""
    A previous Reuters economic poll in July had put 2018 growth
at 4.1 percent and 3.5 percent for next year - signalling how
dramatically sentiment towards Turkey has deteriorated in the
space of just three months.
    
    RECESSION IMMINENT
    The economy is now expected to contract 1.4 percent in the
fourth quarter of this year and officially enter into a
recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of negative
growth - in the first three months of 2019, with a 2.1 percent
contraction, the latest poll showed.
    Those quarterly growth forecasts are based on a smaller
sample of contributors.
    ""A steep recession is under way,"" noted Liam Carson,
Emerging Europe Economist at Capital Economics in London.
    Ratings agencies have repeatedly sounded alarm about the
outlook for Turkey, and in particular, its banks. Albayrak has
promised $12 billion in new savings and revenue for 2019 under
the government's new economic programme, but that has failed to
mollify investors.
    For years, Turkish companies, particularly construction
firms, borrowed in dollars and euros, drawn by cheaper interest
rates. But the lira crisis has driven up the cost of servicing
that debt, meaning lenders - themselves reliant on external
financing - also face a wave of defaults at home.
    Inflation is expected to average 25.3 percent in the fourth
quarter, and surge to 28.6 percent in the first quarter of 2019,
the poll showed.
    But despite that increase, economists predicated the central
bank's main policy would stay at 24 percent until the third
quarter of next year, when it would begin to decline slightly.
    Erdogan, a self-described ""enemy of interest rates"" has
repeatedly called on the central bank to lower rates and provide
cheaper credit to companies. While the bank has hiked interest
rates by 11.25 percentage points this year, investors say it has
been slow to act and not aggressive enough.

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Germany's BGA trade association
has lowered its forecast for export growth this year to 3.5
percent from 5 percent previously, citing weaker demand from
abroad in light of rising trade tensions and Britain's departure
from the European Union.
    BGA head Holger Bingmann said on Wednesday German exports
would expand less dynamically in the second half of the year
because global economic growth was slowing. He expects exports
growth to be even weaker in 2019.
    An escalation of the trade dispute between the United States
and China would hit German exporters ""without a doubt
massively"", Bingmann said.
    The United States is Germany's most important single export
destination after the bloc of European Union countries while
China is its biggest business partner in overall trade volumes. 
 So the Sino-U.S. tariffs dispute is also hitting German firms.
    Turning to Brexit, Bingmann said: ""There is the real threat
of a no-deal exit which neither side wants."" Such a scenario
could disrupt the supply chains of many companies, costing them
billions of euros, he warned.
    European Union leaders will give British Prime Minister
Theresa May a tough reception in Brussels on Wednesday, warning
her to rally support at home for the Brexit deal on offer or be
cut loose without one in March. [nL8N1WW73K]

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds extended
a rally on Wednesday, with two-year yields falling eight basis
points to one-week lows as a rally by global stocks and the lack
of fresh negative headlines over the country's budget boosted
sentiment.
    Rome has officially approved its expansion budget, but
markets are relieved that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria remains
in office. Although analysts see a good chance the European
Commission will reject Italy's budget, they said the lack of
further shocks in Monday's proposal had prompted further buying
of government bonds. 
    European stock markets opened higher, mirroring earlier
rises in Asia and on Wall Street on the back of strong earnings.
<.STOXX> <MKTS/GLOB>
    ""There has been some relief because everyone was concerned
that more details would emerge that would not be pleasant for
the market,"" said Daniel Lenz, rates strategist at DZ Bank. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday he was
proud of the budget, adding that austerity is no longer a path
Italy can follow [nL8N1WW5I0].
    However, Lenz said that the relief rally could be
short=-lived as Italy's credit rating, and the European
Commission's response to Italy's budget proposal come into
focus.
    ""We think they won't accept this (proposal), but there is a
fair chance both sides show willingness for compromise,"" he
said. ""What is really important is how the ratings agencies
react.""
    The EC warned that the budget may run into opposition from
euro zone partners. 
    ""If we accepted everything that the Italian government was
proposing, we would see a virulent counter-reaction from other
euro zone countries,"" European Commission President Jean Claude
Juncker told reporters in Brussels.
    The commission now will have two weeks to review Italy's
fiscal plans underpinning the budget. It could reject them
completely and ask Rome to rewrite them, an unprecedented step
that would formally begin a long dispute [nL8N1WW5I0].
    Italy's two-year government bond yields touched a low of
1.48 percent, while the 10-year yield slipped seven basis points
lower to 3.39 percent <IT2YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR>.
    The 10-year Italy/Germany bond yield spread held below 300
basis points -- a level analysts deem to be a threshold for
buying or selling Italian debt -- and was last at 291.5 basis
points, having recorded its biggest one-day fall in nearly two
weeks on Tuesday.
    Elsewhere, euro zone bond yields were benefiting from
improved global risk appetite, with Portuguese and Spanish
government bonds extending Tuesday's falls.  
    Germany's government bond yield, the benchmark for the
region, also opened lower, below 0.5 percent, and was last
around 0.484 percent. <DE10YT=RR>.
    Portuguese government bond yields were two basis points
lower, continuing a good-will rally after its budget
presentation and an ratings upgrade on Friday <PT10YT=RR>. 
    Portugal's 10-year government bond was fell a further two
basis points in early trade after losing seven basis points on
Tuesday, its largest one-day fall since mid-June. It was last
seen at 1.92 percent. 
    Spanish government bonds were also down two basis points
across the curve. <ES5YT=RR>, <ES10YT=RR>.

in September in line with market expectations, driven mainly by
a spike in energy prices, but core inflation, which excludes
energy and unprocessed food costs, edged lower, data showed on
Wednesday.
    The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said
consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.5
percent month-on-month in September for a 2.1 percent
year-on-year rise, matching expectations of economists polled by

0.51 point.

grew 0.3 percent month-on-month for a 1.1 percent year-on-year

July.
    The ECB wants to keep the headline inflation number below,

    * EM currencies most undervalued ever - BAML
    * S. Africa retail sales data eyed 

    By Sruthi Shankar and Aaron Saldanha
    Oct 17 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks hit one-week highs
on Wednesday as a strong start to the U.S. corporate earnings
season encouraged investors globally to take on more risk after
a sell-off last week. 
    A grind higher for the dollar kept the MSCI index of major
emerging currencies under pressure <.MIEM00000CUS> with South
Africa's rand <ZAR=> near a two-week low and the rouble <RUB=>
and Turkish lira <TRY=> struggling to hold on to early gains.
    But stock markets in Korea <.KS11>, China <.SSEC> and Turkey
<.XU100> - all hit by this year's sell-off of riskier emerging
market assets - gained ground after the worst two weeks since
February for the sector as a whole <.MSCIEF>. 
    ""Risk has come back into markets, and the bulls have
wrestled back control,"" said Chris Weston, head of research with
Australian foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone. ""We can see
the relief playing through in Asia. China found good buyers.""
    Emerging market currencies have also sunk this year, led by
Turkey's lira, as rising U.S. interest rates pulled capital back
into the dollar and worries about global growth and trade
unnerved investors in the developing world. 
    The U.S. Federal Reserve issues its September meeting
minutes later on Wednesday and a bullish outlook from the U.S.
central bank on the economy that ignores signs of tension on
financial markets is likely to impinge further on emerging
markets. 
    China's yuan <CNH=> edged lower in offshore trade in spite
of the People's Bank setting a stronger midpoint at the daily
fixing. 
    Koon Chow, a strategist at UBP, argued that any further
weakness in emerging bond markets was likely to focus on
higher-rated bonds with yields closer to U.S. Treasuries. 
    ""EM currencies are cheap, there is a lot of bad news baked
in. Those will be insensitive (to the minutes),"" he said. 
    ""The high rated stuff which have super low yields like
Central Europe, bits of Asia, where yields are maybe 1.5 percent
or 1 percent above U.S. treasuries, will be sensitive.""
    A survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed a record
number of investors said emerging market currencies are
undervalued - the cheapest valuation since the survey began.
[nL8N1WW5OY]
    The Turkish lira dipped a day after data showed industrial
production grew at its slowest pace in almost two years in
August, reinforcing concerns about a sharp slowdown in the
economy. [nL8N1WW2K7] 
    A Reuters poll showed Turkish economic growth was expected
to fall short of sharply lowered government forecasts this year
and next, with a recession now likely in the coming six months.
[nL3N1WW3XC]
    Still, the Turkish treasury said it had sold $2 billion of
the 5-year Eurobond at a yield of 7.5 percent with demand
exceeding $6 billion - pointing to a recovery in investors'
confidence in the country.
    South Africa's rand weakened for the first time in five days
as investors awaited retail sales for clues on the economy's
health, especially after it unexpectedly tipped into recession
in the second quarter.
    Ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday that it expected new
South African Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to keep the
government's broad policies intact in the medium-term budget
speech due next week. [nJ8N1WI03A]

weaker-than-expected inflation data took the pound down a notch.
The index is dominated by international exporters, who benefit
from a weaker currency [nU8N13000D].
    Shares in education publisher Pearson <PSON.L> topped the
FTSE with a 3.9 percent rise after it stuck to its target of
returning to profit this year [nL8N1WX14L].
    ""The education giant has been shifting away from more
traditional classroom materials in favour of digital, and
progress there looks more positive,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity
analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
    Pearson is a widely shorted stock, and the amount of shares
out on loan has risen this year, data from FIS Astec Analytics
showed.
    A weak update from mid-cap housebuilder Crest Nicholson
<CRST.L> sent the shares down 6.2 percent. That weighed on FTSE
100 housebuilders Persimmon <PSN.L>, Taylor Wimpey <TW.L>, and
Berkeley Group <BKGH.L> which lost 1.6 to 3.2 percent.
    Crest Nicholson warned its full-year profit would be lower
than expected, citing a challenging real estate market, and said
its chief financial officer had stepped down [nL3N1WX2G5].
    Hargreaves Lansdown <HRGV.L> shares gained 3.3 percent after
Bernstein analysts upgraded it to ""market-perform"" from
""underperform"", saying they were now more convinced its
valuation is justified. 
    Shares in software company Micro Focus <MCRO.L> were also
among top gainers, up 3.1 percent as tech shares across Europe
climbed. 
    Overall, analysts are downgrading their earnings estimates
for the FTSE 100 as well as the mid-cap FTSE 250 index, which
was down 0.1 percent on Wednesday.
    ""Valuations don't look particularly stretched in absolute
terms, but the earnings newsflow is still mixed at best,"" said
Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt. 
    The mid-cap segment, home to more growth stocks, fell in
last week's selloff as investors seemed to turn back to value
plays. Growth still had its attractions, though.
    ""You can be too gung ho about saying I'm rotating into
value, if the earnings are still quite disappointing,"" said
Williams.
    Mid-caps saw big moves after results and broker notes.  
Mediclinic <MDCM.L> shares sank 20 percent to the bottom of the
FTSE 250 after its earnings and margins missed estimates, hit by
weaker performance in its Swiss segment [nL8N1WX1ZV].
    ""Investors will likely be disappointed by Swiss performance
while revised margin guidance may imply another leg down in the
Swiss story, introducing further uncertainty,"" wrote UBS
analysts.
    Inchcape <INCH.L> shares tumbled 10 percent after HSBC
slashed its target price on the stock to 650p from 840p. 
    Dealmaking was also a mover. Shares in ContourGlobal <GLO.L>
climbed 3 percent after the power firm said it was in talks to
possibly buy Spanish utility Iberdrola's <IBE.MC> 50-megawatt
solar power plant in Spain [nL3N1WX2T4].
    Among small-caps, Asos <ASOS.L> shares jumped 12 percent
after the online fashion retailer said its potential was ""huge"".
It narrowly beat forecasts with a 28 percent jump in 2017-18
profits, maintaining guidance for its new financial year
[nL8N1WX13L].
    ""Asos' positive statement should reassure investors today,
concerned by recent disappointments in the retail sector (muted
sales growth and various profit warnings),"" said Stifel
analysts.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Paris/London-October 17: French banks may moderately loosen 
lending standards to support origination volumes and market share in the 
residential loan market as the refinancing boom wanes, Fitch Ratings says. 
However, generally prudent lending practices in a largely fixed-rate market 
should support performance and loan guarantees would limit the impact of any 
performance deterioration on banks. 

Refinancing activity was a major contributor to the strong rebound in French 
residential lending from its trough in early 2013 to an historic high in 1Q17, 
as interest rates fell and banks competed to lend. But refinancing's share of 
new origination has fallen as borrowers have successfully locked in low fixed 
rates. Refinancing accounted for about 10% of new residential loans in 1Q18, 
down from nearly 24% last year and 35% in 2015, according to data from the 
French banking regulator (the Autorite de Controle Prudentiel et de Resolution, 
or ACPR).

title=""FW French Residential Property Lending"" width=""675"" height=""642"" 
scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" 
allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

Rising home prices and more sales pushed origination volumes excluding 
refinancing to EUR168 billion in 2017, from about EUR140 billion in 2016. But as 
residential loan rates have stabilised close to their troughs and refinancing 
has slowed this year, there have been initial signs that banks may loosen 
underwriting criteria to maintain market share and in response to stretched 
affordability in some areas. 

For example, average loan/value (LTV) at origination hit a new peak of 87% at 
end-2017, according to ACPR data. The figure has typically been about 80% in the 
past (some banks in other European housing markets have also engaged in higher 
LTV lending as the potential for further refinancing has fallen). Leverage 
multiples were nearly 5x annual revenue, up from 3.3x before the financial 
crisis.  

We do not think that a significant deterioration in French underwriting 
standards is likely. French residential lending is characterised by prudent 
underwriting based on borrowers' ability to pay, which has been supported by low 
interest rates. ACPR data show that at end-2017, the average debt service/income 
(DSTI) ratio had risen to 29.7%, but this is within its historical range of 
28%-32% as are average loan maturities at origination (19 years). 

Residential loans are mostly amortising fixed-rate loans, meaning that changes 
in borrowers' employment status, rather than rising interest rates, are the main 
risk to performance. This remains strong - impaired loans were at 1.47% at 
end-2017 - although higher LTVs at origination could increase loss given 
default. Amortisation means that the average current LTV of outstanding loans 
and their residual maturity has been stable since 2010, at about 70% and 15 
years, respectively. 

Close to 60% of loans outstanding at end-2017 were guaranteed by either a 
specialised institution such as Credit Logement or an insurer, limiting the risk 
for banks. These internal or external guarantors generally apply their own 
underwriting criteria, meaning that guaranteed loans undergo a double 
underwriting process. 

Stretched affordability and eventually rising rates could see housing market 
activity (which saw a record 968,000 sales of existing homes last year) and 
price rises cool. This will be accentuated if lenders feel they have limited 
headroom to further increase residential loan maturities and DSTI ratios, 
although we think lenders may still see scope to increase metrics further toward 
pre-crisis levels (average DSTIs peaked at close to 32% in 2009).

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Central European currencies
gave up some of their recent gains on Wednesday while government
bonds firmed slightly as an equities rebound driven by global
trends also lost some steam.
    Regional stock indices tracked a continuing strengthening in
Asian shares after Wall Street was boosted by earnings reports
from some U.S. companies.
    Optimism was tempered by clouds over the German economy, the
region's key trade partner, and a cautious retreat for German
shares <.GDAX> after two days of gains. [nEONIAC0S8]
    Budapest's main stock index <.BUX> rose by a third of a
percent by 0850 GMT, set a four-month high and tested five-month
peaks, with OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> and drugmaker Richter <GDRB.BU>
shares hovering near key technical levels.
    OTP has been driven back several times from the 10,300
forint levels in the past months, while Richter has struggled to
break through the 5,400 forint line, Erste analysts wrote. 
    Bucharest <.BETI> shed 0.1 percent after getting close to a
five-month high in early trade. 
    Warsaw's blue-chip index <.WIG20> rose half a percent,
returning to levels last seen before it dropped to three-month
lows a week ago as global stocks were plunging. 
    Currencies and government bond yields failed to receive
support from Polish industrial output data for September, which
came in  weaker than expected.
    Annual output growth slowed to 2.8 percent from 5 percent in
August, below analysts' 4.3 percent forecast.    
    Wage and employment figures released on Tuesday also
confirmed a slowdown in Poland's robust economic growth,
analysts said.
    The zloty <EURPLN=> led a retreat of regional currencies
after a rise in the previous three sessions, easing by 0.2
percent to 4.2935 versus the euro. The forint <EURHUF=> and the
Czech crown <EURCZK=> shed 0.1 percent.
    ""I would say the figures did not influence the zloty,"" one
Warsaw-based dealer said. ""It is in very narrow ranges ... and
it is firmer than last week's levels beyond 4.3.""
    The latest Polish economic figures confirmed that the
central bank is unlikely to change its loose policy stance any
time soon. 
    The trend shown by a 2.9 percent rise in Polish producer
prices in September suggests ""limited space for increase of
inflationary pressure"", Erste Group analyst Katarzyna
Rzentarzewska said in a note.
    But Poland's economic growth, which earned a credit rating
upgrade from Standard & Poor's last Friday, is expected to
remain strong.
    The World Bank on Wednesday increased its forecast for
Poland's growth this year to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent.
[nEONIAC0S8]
    The data was supportive for Polish government bonds.
    The yield on 10-year paper shed 1 basis point to 3.192
percent by 0923 GMT, in line with a drop in the corresponding
Bund yield, after euro zone inflation figures matched
expectations.

    By Virginia Furness and Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Long-dated Italian government
bonds were being sold off on Wednesday after the government
announced a buyback and reopening of longer dated issues, as
global stocks markets came under renewed selling pressure and
dented appetite for riskier assets.  
    In a sign of a recovery in the broader Italian market,
short-dated Italian bond yields remained lower on the day. 
    Italy announced the bond buyback, combined with a reopening
of several long-dated bonds, in a bond exchange deal due later
this week. [nL8N1WX3BR]
    While buybacks tend to boost the Italian market, the
announcement that this will take place with a tap of existing
bonds put upward pressure on long-dated yields.
    Italy's 10-year government bond yield was up 3 basis points
to a session high of 3.48 percent, pushing the gap over Germany
Bund yields above 300 basis points. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10IT10YT=RR>.
    The short-end of the curve, which is more directly impacted
by budgetary concerns held lower, however. 
    Rome on Monday officially approved an expansionary budget,
but markets are relieved that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
remains in office, prompting a strong run in Italian bonds
since. [nL8N1WW5I0]
    Italy's two-year government bond yield was down 4 basis
points at 1.55 percent, having hit a one and a half week low at
1.48 percent early in the session.<IT2YT=RR> 
    Next year's projected 2.4 percent of output deficit is well
below the EU's 3 percent ceiling - a policy to discourage member
states from going down a path of unsustainable spending - but it
is up sharply from a targeted 1.8 percent this year.
    This contravenes EU regulations that call on Italy and other
highly indebted countries to steadily narrow the shortfall
towards zero. Analysts see a likelihood the European Commission
will reject the budget.
    Last week, many appeared to be positioning for worse news on
the budget front, with data suggesting investors were going
heavily short on Italian debt, said UniCredit rates strategist
Luca Cazzulani. 
    Thomson Reuters data shows that open interest in short-dated
BTP futures was at its highest in over a year on Oct. 11, and
remained elevated for the rest of the week. <FBTSc1> 
    ""The fact that you had such high open interest at a time of
dropping bond prices suggests that a lot of shorts were coming
into the market,"" said Cazzulani. ""With the absence of any
negative news this week, some of that will come out."" 
    A renewed sell-off in world stock markets accelerated the
selling of long-dated Italian debt while boosting demand for
safe havens such as high-rated Germany. <.STOXX> 
    Germany's government bond yield, the benchmark for the
region, hit a two-week low of 0.457 pct after global stock
markets came under renewed selling pressure. <DE10YT=RR>.
    With the exception of Italy, most other euro zone bond
yields were 2-3 bps on the day.

    ATHENS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Greek Foreign Minister Nikos
Kotzias has submitted his resignation, Greece's Skai TV reported
on Wednesday.
    There was no immediate confirmation from the government.
Earlier, it had been widely reported Kotzias had clashed with 
Defence Minister Panos Kammenos over a deal brokering an end to
a decades-old name dispute with Macedonia.
    Kotzias was Greece's main negotiator in the talks that led
to the June accord with Skopje to rename the neighbouring
country North Macedonia.
    That deal has however been thrown in limbo following a
referendum in Macedonia on Sept. 30 which failed to muster a
minimum turnout to render it valid.
    Greek media reported on Wednesday that Kotzias and Kammenos,
a coalition partner in the government, had argued during a
cabinet meeting on Tuesday chaired by Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras.
    Kammenos, who heads the small right-wing Independent Greeks
party, is vehemently against the accord with Macedonia and has
said he could quit the government over it.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Warsaw/London-October 17: Fitch Ratings has downgraded 
Poland-based Bank Pekao SA's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' 
from 'A-'. The Long-Term IDR is on Stable Outlook. Pekao's Viability Rating (VR) 
has been downgraded to 'bbb+' from 'a-'. A full list of rating actions is at the 
end of this commentary.

The downgrade of Pekao's Long-Term IDR is driven by the downgrade of the bank's 
VR. The downgrade of the VR reflects the decline of the bank's Fitch core 
capital (FCC) ratio to a level, which is broadly similar to peers and no longer 
sufficient to support Pekao's VR being above most of those peers'.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS

The IDRs of Pekao are driven by the bank's intrinsic strength, as reflected in 
its VR. The Stable Outlook on Pekao reflects our expectations of little change 
to its own intrinsic creditworthiness in the near term.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

The Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' and the Support Rating of '5' for Pekao 
express Fitch's opinion that potential sovereign support for the bank cannot be 
relied upon. This is underpinned by the Polish resolution legal framework, which 
requires senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of a 
bank receiving sovereign support.

Pekao is 20% owned by PZU S.A. (PZU), which is the largest insurance company in 
central and eastern Europe (CEE) and controlled by the Polish state, and 12.8% 
by PFR S.A. (PFR, a state-owned development fund). The remaining shares are 
widely held. Pekao is fully consolidated in PZU Group's accounts. Should Fitch 
take the view that PZU's propensity to support Pekao is strong, we will consider 
the insurer's ability to support the bank. This may result in the Support Rating 
being based on institutional rather than sovereign support. However, Fitch 
expects the bank's IDRs to continue to be driven by the VR.

VR

The bank's rating strengths include a well-established domestic market 
franchise, a stable business model, conservative risk appetite, strong 
capitalisation, sound asset quality, solid profitability and robust funding and 
liquidity.

The Polish authorities classify Pekao as a systemically important institution. 
At end-1H18, Pekao was the second-largest bank by total assets with about a 10% 
market share. 

Pekao's underwriting standards are reasonable and commensurate with the bank's 
business model and country risks. Default rates are low and loan impairment 
charges (LICs) in new disbursements are modest. This reflects a cautious 
approach to lending but is also a function of a supportive economic environment. 


Fitch's assessment of the bank's capitalisation as strong mainly reflects a high 
FCC ratio, solid capital buffers over regulatory minimum levels, modest 
unreserved impaired loans, solid recurring profitability and a conservative risk 
profile.  At end-1H18, the FCC ratio was 16.4%. 

The solid asset quality reflects the bank's moderate business risk, 
well-diversified credit risk (by industry and single name), adequate coverage of 
bad debt by loan loss allowances and prudent underwriting. At end-1H18, the 
bank's impaired loan ratio (comprising Stage 3 loans) was about 6%. We believe 
asset quality should remain broadly stable in 2019 and beyond, due to 
conservative origination of new loans and the supportive economic environment, 
which contains the inflow of new bad debts. 

Profitability is commensurate with Pekao's business model and the Polish 
operating environment. Profitability is sufficiently strong to support near-term 
growth and provide material loss-absorption capacity. In 1H18, the ratio of 
operating profit/ risk-weighted assets equalled 2.6%. 

The bank's robust funding and liquidity reflects a high self-financing capacity 
(based on stable customer deposits) and strong coverage of short-term 
liabilities by liquid assets. We believe that the bank's stable deposit 
franchise is sufficient to withstand even a severe market stress.

The bank's gross loans/deposits ratio was about 90% at end-1H18, and has 
remained stable. Liquidity is strong and sufficiently covers refinancing needs 
in 2019. At end-1H18, the share of highly liquid assets in total assets equalled 
22%, with the liquidity buffer comprising predominantly cash, short-term 
interbank deposits and unencumbered Polish sovereign debt.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRS

Pekao's IDRs are sensitive to changes in the bank's VR. 

VR

The VR is likely to be resilient to moderate deterioration in the operating 
environment. However, a marked and prolonged weakening in the Polish economy 
(not Fitch's base scenario) that materially affects the bank's asset quality, 
capitalisation and profitability could lead to the VR being downgraded.

An upgrade of the VR of Pekao is unlikely in the foreseeable future given its 
high rating level relative to peers and the Polish sovereign (A-/Stable). 

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

The Support Rating of Pekao is sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the 
potential source of extraordinary support for the bank. If Fitch concludes that 
Pekao's key shareholder, rather than the sovereign, is the more likely source of 
support for the bank, the Support Rating Floor may be withdrawn and the Support 
Rating would reflect the ability and propensity of PZU to provide extraordinary 
support to the bank. 

The rating actions are as follows: 

Pekao

Long-Term IDR: downgraded to 'BBB+' from 'A-', Outlook Stable

Short-Term IDR: affirmed at 'F2'

Viability Rating: downgraded to 'bbb+' from 'a-'

Support Rating: affirmed at '5'

Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor'

    By Michael Shields
    ZURICH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Prospects for a treaty cementing
ties between Switzerland and the European Union, its biggest
trading partner, appeared to fade on Wednesday as four years of
negotiations failed to produce a breakthrough by the EU's
mid-October deadline.
    The talks are complicated by Britain's separate negotiations
on divorce terms from the EU, with the European Commission loath
to be too soft on the Swiss for fear of providing ammunition to
Brexiteers. [nL8N1WW73K]
    ""I can honestly say I find it difficult to believe that the
government will be able to present by year's end a solution to
all the open questions,"" said Petra Goessi, leader of the
pro-business Liberals party in the four-party cabinet.
    ""Switzerland is not yet ready"" for a treaty, she told the
Neue Zuercher Zeitung daily in an interview published on
Wednesday.
    Labour rules to protect high wages in non-EU Switzerland
from cross-border competition have been a bone of contention
with Brussels. [nL8N1WE4JS] [nL8N1WC1TY]
    Talks seemed deadlocked after a meeting of top negotiators
in Brussels on Tuesday.
    ""Major political issues remain open. It is in this light
that the European Commission will now have to assess at
political level how to proceed,"" a Commission spokeswoman said.
    The Swiss government said after a meeting on Wednesday of
the cabinet, called the Federal Council, only that it took note
of the situation. ""No date was officially given for the end of
the talks. What matters most for the Federal Council is the
quality of the agreement reached and the Council will release
its decisions in due time,"" a spokesman said.
    Brussels has been pressing Switzerland to agree a pact that
would sit atop an existing patchwork of 120 sectoral accords and
have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to single market rules.
    It would focus on five areas linked to the single market:
the free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport,
mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm
goods. The treaty would also provide a more effective platform
to resolve disputes.
    Should treaty talks fail, the sectoral accords would stay in
effect, but two-way ties would enter a deep freeze.
    Failure to strike a deal would mean no increase in Swiss
access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity
union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for
Swiss makers of products such as medical devices, if pacts on
mutual recognition of standards lapse.
    The Commission has threatened not to extend beyond this year
recognition of Swiss stock exchange rules that allow
cross-border trading, which could touch off tit-for-tat
escalation. [nL8N1WB57A]

    By Robin Emmott and Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The European Union should agree
a sanctions law to target computer hackers by early next year,
the bloc's leaders are set to say on Thursday and will also seek
a pledge from Russia and China to help stop cyber attacks,
internal EU documents show.
    Despite some reluctance from Italy's anti-establishment
government, EU leaders will make the call for a new regime to
impose economic sanctions more quickly on specific hackers
anywhere in the world at their summit on Thursday.
    ""Work on the capacity to respond to and deter cyber attacks
through EU restrictive measures should be taken forward,"" EU
leaders will say, according to a draft of their final summit
statement, using EU parlance for economic sanctions.
    ""Negotiations on all cybersecurity proposals should be
concluded before the end of the (EU) legislature,"" the draft
statement said, referring to the April 18, 2019, closure of the
European Parliament's term.
    Addressing the German parliament on Wednesday, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of possible manipulation of next
May's European Parliament election, in the latest warning by an
EU government that Russia may use cyber attacks and
disinformation campaigns to undermine the vote. 
    Russia has made cyber and electronic warfare part of its
military operations, Western officials say, and Britain, the
Netherlands and the United States have accused Moscow of
conducting a global campaign of computer hacks against the West.
[nL8N1WK35D]
    Russia denies meddling in elections or hacking institutions.
Russian officials portray such allegations as part of a campaign
intended to entrench Moscow's reputation as an enemy.
    Diplomats at the Western military alliance NATO, which is
set to have its own fully operational cyber command in 2023, say
criminal groups in China and North Korea, as well as Islamist
militants, are also behind attacks on Western computer networks.
 
    The 28 EU leaders will meet Asian leaders and including
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and China's Premier Li
Keqiang for a summit in Brussels from Thursday evening, where
cyber security is expected to be discussed, with a focus on
combating hackers in the final statement.
    China also denies responsibility for cyber attacks. 
    
    ITALY'S PRO-RUSSIA STANCE
    Britain is pushing for the special EU sanctions regime of
travel bans and asset freezes before it leaves the bloc next
year. That could allow London to align its sanctions policy with
the bloc in the future.
    But Italy's anti-establishment government is resisting the
measures as it seeks better ties with Russia, although Italian
Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte is not expected to challenge the
wording of the final statement because it is still vague, three
diplomats said.
    Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt sought to reassure
his Italian counterpart Enzo Moavero Milanesi on Monday at a
meeting of the EU's foreign ministers in Luxembourg, the
diplomats added. 
    Britain and the Netherlands also made a plea to their fellow
ministers at the closed-door Luxembourg meeting after other
countries joined them in making a formal request for economic
sanctions on individual cyber attackers.
    Most other EU countries now back the proposals, including
France and Germany, diplomats said.
    Sophisticated computer hacking weapons and cybersurveillance
software allows hostile governments to spy on and undermine the
West, often using criminal groups for cover, experts say.
    At the special EU-Asia leaders summit on Thursday evening
and Friday, the European Union will seek a political commitment
from all 51 leaders gathered in Brussels to stop such criminals.
    Leaders will stress ""the importance of combating cyber
security threats, preventing potential use of information and
communication technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes
and disinformation"", according to a draft statement.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Elvet Mortgages 2018-1 plc

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10048105

Fitch Ratings-London-October 17: Fitch Ratings has assigned Elvet Mortgages 
2018-1 plc a final rating, as follows:

GBP486,200,000	Class A: 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable

GBP60,949,636	Class Z: Not Rated

Elvet Mortgages 2018-1 plc is a securitisation of owner-occupied residential 
mortgages originated in England, Wales and Scotland by Atom Bank plc (Atom), a 
new lender that originated its first mortgage loan in December 2016.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Prime Assets; Limited History

The loans within the pool all have characteristics in line with Fitch's 
expectations for a prime mortgage pool. This includes no previous adverse 
credit, full income verification, full or automated valuation model (AVM) 
property valuation and a clear lending policy. The limited history of 
origination and subsequent performance data is sufficiently mitigated through 
available proxy data and adjustments made to the foreclosure frequency (FF) in 
Fitch's analysis.

Low Asset Yield

The collateral portfolio bears a lower-than-average fixed interest rate than 
similar RMBS pools rated by Fitch. In Fitch's base-case scenario, the 
transaction relies on its reserve funds to maintain timely interest payments to 
the class A notes before the loans revert to the sellers' standard variable rate 
(SVR). The assigned rating does not rely on the excess spread reserve fund, 
envisaged to mitigate asset yield risk for the first two years after transaction 
closing.

Untested Servicing Platform

Atom is the contracted servicer and has limited experience of the full 
end-to-end servicing process, including arrears collection and foreclosure. This 
limited experience is sufficiently mitigated by back-up servicer provisions. 
Link Mortgage Services (RPS2-/RSS2-) is the appointed back-up servicer.

Unrated Originator and Seller

The originator and seller is not a rated entity and as such may have limited 
resources available to repurchase any mortgages in the event of a breach of the 
representations and warranties (RWs) given to the issuer. The satisfactory 
findings of the AUP report and of Fitch's loan file review mitigate this 
weakness. 

Replaceable Collection Account Bank

NatWest is the appointed collection account bank, but Atom can assume this role 
if it becomes a direct member of CHAPS, BACS, Cheque Clearing and Faster 
Payments. Atom will also be required to fund an increase in the reserve fund 
balance to 2.35% of the initial collateral balance via a further drawing from 
the subordinated loan prior to receiving collections. Fitch tested the 
transaction for six months of payment interruption risk assuming Atom replaced 
the contracted collection account bank.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Material increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
receivables producing losses greater than Fitch's base case expectations may 
result in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch's analysis revealed that a 
30% increase in the weighted average (WA) foreclosure frequency, along with a 
30% decrease in the WA recovery rate, would imply a downgrade of the class A 
notes to 'AA-sf' from 'AAAsf'.

More detailed model implied ratings sensitivity can be found in the new issue 
report, which is available at www.fitchratings.com.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch reviewed the results of a third party assessment conducted on the asset 
portfolio information, and concluded that there were no findings that affected 
the rating analysis.

Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of Atom Bank plc's 
origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to 
be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the 
other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable.

    * CFTC says could retaliate quickly if no amendments
    * EU has said rules not aimed at U.S. clearing houses

    By Michelle Price and Huw Jones
    WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. banks and
securities houses could be barred from trading on exchanges in
the European Union if the bloc refuses to water down
""irresponsible"" proposals for regulating foreign clearing
houses, a top U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.
    Christopher Giancarlo, chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC), gave his strongest warning yet on
possible retaliatory measures if EU regulators insist on close
supervision of U.S.-based clearing houses under new rules.
    ""In my talks with European authorities, I have asked them to
reconsider such an expansive approach,"" Giancarlo told a
derivatives industry event in Chicago in a rare direct attack on
another regulator.
    The new rules, which the bloc aims to approve before Britain
leaves the EU next March, would mean that ""systemic"" foreign
clearing houses could only serve customers in the EU if European
regulators can jointly supervise them.
    Giancarlo said the CFTC will not allow the firms it
regulates to comply with conflicting and overly burdensome
regulation from abroad.
    ""If a satisfactory resolution of this situation cannot be
found, the CFTC will have no choice but to consider a range of
readily available steps to protect U.S. markets and market
participants,"" Giancarlo said.
    The CFTC has ""strong and blunt"" tools it can deploy
unilaterally as a last resort without new legislation, including
the withdrawal of the exemptions that allow U.S. market
participants to use trading platforms in the EU.
    The watchdog has privately warned European officials that
the bloc would suffer far more than the United States in an
all-out clearing war because U.S. firms are much larger
liquidity providers to European exchanges than vice versa, a
person familiar with the discussions said.
    The CFTC has so far received no indication from Brussels
that it is willing to budge on its clearing proposal, despite
the CFTC in recent weeks publicly pledging to move to a
""deference"" model of regulators accepting each other's rules to
avoid duplication, this person added. [nL8N1VQ5RW]
    Retaliatory action would be a last resort, this person said.
    
    TARGET LONDON
    The proposed EU rules were prompted by Britain's decision to
leave the bloc next March, targeting a core activity that helps
make the City of London a top global financial centre.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L>, clears
over 90 percent of euro-denominated interest rate swaps
contracts used by companies to insure themselves against
unexpected moves in borrowing costs. [nL5N1UT1P3]
    But U.S. clearing houses like CME and ICE clear transactions
for EU customers as well. Giancarlo said this would mean
on-going EU surveillance and on-site inspections, with the bloc
""dictating"" board composition and corporate governance.
    EU officials have said they want similar access to foreign
clearing houses that the CFTC and the U.S. Federal Reserve have
with LCH’s dollar-denominated swaps clearing in London.
    The CFTC has not given Brussels a deadline for responding
but it does not anticipate that there would be much opportunity
for the bloc to make changes once the EU legislation is passed
in March, the same person said.

    By Renee Maltezou and Michele Kambas
    ATHENS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
accepted the resignation of his foreign minister on Wednesday,
Greece's first major political casualty in a crusade to end a
decades-old name dispute with Macedonia.
    Tsipras has said he will do whatever is required to ensure
an agreement reached in June to rename the neighbouring country
'Republic of North Macedonia' gets implemented.
    But the accord has faced opposition on both sides of the
border, and Tsipras' Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias and Defence
Minister Panos Kammenos clashed over it in cabinet on Tuesday.
""They are both explosive characters,"" a witness told Reuters.
    Kotzias, a strong supporter of the accord who was Greece's
main negotiator in the talks that led to it, submitted his
resignation on Wednesday.
    Kammenos, whose small right-wing party is propping up
Tsipras' fragile coalition government, views the deal as a
national sell-out.
    Warning against further dissent, the prime minister said he
would take over the foreign affairs portfolio himself.
    ""It is a decision not to tolerate, from now on, any
double-speak from anyone, or any personal agenda (against)
...the national line,"" he said in a televised statement, without
elaborating.
    Tsipras, whose left-wing Syriza party is trailing badly
ahead of national elections due next year, is hoping a
successful name change deal - a precondition for Greece to lift
its veto on Macedonia joining the EU and NATO - will help boost
his political standing abroad.
    
    NOT A DONE DEAL
    The June accord delighted the west in a region where it
jostles for influence with Moscow. Two Russian diplomats were
expelled from Greece that same month under Kotzias's watch,
accused of trying to foment opposition to the deal. [nL8N1UF2PS]
    Greece has insisted on the change because it views the name
'Macedonia' as implying a territorial claim on a northern Greek
region of that name. 
    But the accord is still far from settled.
    It is awaiting approval from both countries' parliaments
and, though Macedonians backed the name changed in a referendum
last month, just 37 percent turned out to vote - too few for the
result to be valid.
    Kammenos has threatened to quit the coalition if it is put
before parliament.
    During Tuesday's fractious cabinet meeting, Tsipras asked
his ministers to put their difference aside and back him if a no
confidence vote was called by the main opposition. 
    In a colourful tweet following his resignation, Kotzias
spouted poetry. ""They wanted to bury me deep, but forgot I was a
seed.""
    Earlier on Wednesday, government spokesman Dimitris
Tzanakopoulos compared the government to a train that had a
clear direction and would reach its destination. ""If anyone
...feels frustrated, he can just get off.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders are
meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss Brexit after London
walked away last week from a deal the EU has offered over
disagreements on how to keep an open Irish border [nL8N1WX526].
    Below please find comments by EU leaders upon arriving at
the summit.
    
    MARK RUTTE, DUTCH PRIME MINISTER
    ""I do think a lot of progress has been made.""
    ""The debate is now concentrating on this issue of the Irish
border and how to prevent a border on the Irish sea, which is 
something the UK desperately wants to avoid.""
    ""At the same time we all want to avoid a hard border on the
island of Ireland.""
    ""I don't think we will solve this issue completely but I am
cautiously optimistic that over coming weeks Michel Barnier and
the negotiating team in the UK will come to final conclusions.""
    
    PETER PELLEGRINI, PRIME MINISTER OF SLOVAKIA
    ""I'm a very optimistic person but not today.""
    ""I think we will receive ... information that there is still
no deal and I think we should do the maximum until the last day
to try to have an agreement.""
    ""But on the other side the other 27 countries, we should be
prepared also for a no-deal result. And I think maybe it will
finish like that.""
    ""My hope was that today we'll have already some concrete
solution on the table, but it looks like it will not be a deal
today."" 
    
    THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
    ""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in
the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the
Northern Irish backstop ... By working intensively and closely,
we can achieve that deal. As I say a deal is in the interests
not just of the UK but also the European Union.""  
    ""Now is the time to make it happen."" 
    
    DALIA GRYBAUSKAITE, PRESIDENT OF LITHUANIA
    ""Today there will be no breakthrough.""
    ""We realise that the technical agreement of last week was
not accepted in London.""
    ""It will be November and maybe even more summits because we
are not yet in the final stage (of negotiations).""
    
    XAVIER BETTEL, PRIME MINISTER OF LUXEMBOURG
    ""We just need to finalise something because the 29th of
March will be the last day of the UK in our family. So we need
to find an agreement. And we still need to work also on
no-deal.""
    ""I am able to come back as often as we need to come if it's
to find a solution. But I don't want just to come to have a cup
of coffee ... We all have to move together.""
    ""We fully understand that Prime Minister May has a difficult
situation in the UK ... We have to move on both sides.""
    ""There is still hope (for a Brexit agreement). But there is
also the possibility of a no-deal. We'll continue to work on a
no-deal too. Even if we have an agreement here it doesn't mean
that Westminster agrees.""
    ""We won't block a longer transition if it's to find a common
solution.""
    ""A divorce is not always good... But the fact is we need to
find an agreement.""
     ""We have a common market and we can't change rules for the
UK.""
    ""I won't be the one who will block a discussion about having
maybe a year more for the backstop.""
    Q: How seriously do you take the prospect of a no deal?
    A: ""Very seriously.""
    ""We can't wait for long to have a solution. We need to hurry
up, they leave in six months.""
    
    JURI RATAS, PRIME MINISTER OF ESTONIA
    ""I regret that we don't have an agreement yet between the UK
and the EU. But I still believe that this agreement is possible
and our goal is to find the solution and to find the way. I
think it's possible.""
    ""It's very important to keep the 27 close. We are united, we
are acting as a team and we understand very well that the main
question is the border question between Northern Ireland and
Ireland.
    ""The UK was and is a close and important partner for us.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The commissioner for the EU
budget, Guenther Oettinger, on Wednesday denied a media report
saying the EU Commission had already decided to reject Italy's
draft budget for next year.
    ""I did not say there is a Commission decision on Italy,"" he
wrote on Twitter after German magazine Der Spiegel published an
interview with him on its website.
    In the article, Der Spiegel said a letter to Italy on its
budget from EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici should
arrive in Rome on Thursday or Friday, without clarifying the
source of this information.
    The magazine later corrected its report and said a letter
from the commission would only come after final discussions
between Moscovici and the Italian government.
    ""It is my personal opinion that based on the figures it is v
(very) likely that we have to ask Italy to correct the draft
budget,"" Oettinger said.
    He added that he had not said the Commission would send a
letter to Italy on its budget on Thursday or Friday.
    Italian ministers, who have repeatedly bristled at what they
see as unnecessary interference from Brussels, urged greater
respect for Rome.
    ""I have read Oettinger's comments and I repeat that they
should stop invading our field and just let the Italian
government work,"" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on
Facebook.
    The EU Commission is currently reviewing Italy's draft
budget and can formally raise concerns about it until next
Monday. If it does so, it can then decide to send the budget
back to Rome for changes by Oct. 29, in what would be an
unprecedented move [nL8N1WV23B].
    Italy's draft budget for next year boosts welfare spending,
cuts the retirement age and hikes deficit spending. This could
be in breach of EU fiscal rules that require Rome to lower its
large public debt.

    Steinhoff has been working on a deal to restructure the debt

wiped more than 90 percent off its market value and forced it to
sell assets to fund working capital.
    The lawsuit was brought by a collective group known as
VEB/European Investors, Steinhoff said. It claimed that certain
financial statements, prospectuses and press releases issued by
the company were incorrect and misleading, the retailer said.

 (Adds opposition comment, other details)
    By Renee Maltezou and Michele Kambas
    ATHENS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
accepted the resignation of his foreign minister on Wednesday,
Greece's first major political casualty in a drive to end a
decades-old name dispute with Macedonia.
    Tsipras has said he will do whatever is required to ensure
an agreement reached in June to rename the neighbouring country
'Republic of North Macedonia' gets implemented, but the deal
faces opposition on both sides of the border.
    Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, who helped negotiate the
name deal, and Defence Minister Panos Kammenos clashed over the
issue in cabinet on Tuesday. Kammenos, who heads a small
right-wing party, views the deal as a national sellout.
    ""They are both explosive characters,"" a witness told
Reuters.
    Tsipras' acceptance of Kotzias's resignation signalled he
was willing to sacrifice one of his closest political allies to
keep his fragile coalition government - comprising his left-wing
Syriza party and Kammenos's Independent Greeks - in power.
    Warning against further dissent, Tsipras said he would take
over the foreign affairs portfolio himself.
    ""It is a decision not to tolerate, from now on, any
double-speak from anyone, or any personal agenda (against)...
the national line,"" he said in a televised statement, without
elaborating.
    Tsipras, whose Syriza party is trailing badly ahead of
national elections due next year, is hoping a successful name
change deal - a precondition set by Greece for lifting its veto
on Macedonia joining the EU and NATO - will help boost his
political standing abroad.
    
    NOT A DONE DEAL
    Greece's Western allies welcomed the June accord in a region
where they jostle for influence with Moscow. Two Russian
diplomats were expelled from Greece that same month on Kotzias's
watch, accused of trying to foment Greek opposition to the deal.
[nL8N1UF2PS]
    Athens has insisted on the change because it views the name
'Macedonia' as implying a territorial claim on a northern Greek
region of that name. 
    But the accord is still far from settled.
    It is awaiting approval from both countries' parliaments
and, though Macedonians backed the name change in a referendum
last month, just 37 percent turned out to vote - too few for the
result to be legally valid.
    Kammenos has threatened to quit the coalition if it is put
before the Greek parliament.
    During Tuesday's fractious cabinet meeting, Tsipras asked
his ministers to put their difference aside and back him if the
opposition calls a no-confidence vote. 
    In a colourful tweet following his resignation, Kotzias
waxed lyrical: ""They wanted to bury me deep, but forgot I was a
seed.""
    The irony of his departing to keep Kammenos and his party in
the government was not lost on the centre-right opposition party
New Democracy, which is leading in the polls. 
    ""I think it's now abundantly clear Mr Tsipras is not just a
weak prime minister, but a prime minister being blackmailed. And
the quicker this farce ends, the better,"" New Democracy leader
Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.

550,3668,aa95a4e355d5925d857a1f6acdf02447,EU right to criticise Italy's budget - ECB's Weidmann,2018-10-18 1:00:01,EUR,7.438510000000001,2018-10-18 1:00:22,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    FRANKFURT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission is
right to be critical of Italy's budget proposal, Bundesbank
President Jens Weidmann said on Wednesday, adding that Rome must
obey its fiscal commitments.
    Taking the unusual step of commenting on another euro zone
member's domestic politics, Weidmann argued that monetary policy
normalisation will place an increasing burden on highly indebted
countries so there is no place for leniency with Rome.
    Italy is locked in a showdown with Brussels over its plans
to raise its deficit to 2.4 percent of its economic output,
breaching the EU's requirement for it to cut the fiscal
shortfall.
    With a debt burden equivalent to 130 percent of its GDP,
Italy is one of Europe's most indebted countries. Some investors
fear that any big selloff in Italian assets could also spread to
other weaker members of the euro zone, potentially derailing the
bloc's recovery.
    ""As part of the necessary monetary policy normalization,
interest rates will rise again and that will place a heavy
burden on highly indebted countries,"" Weidmann, often mentioned
as a potential candidate to replace ECB President Mario Draghi,
said in Berlin.
    ""The European Commission has therefore rightly made a very
critical comment on Italy's recent budget plans and the breach
of the rules,"" said Weidmann, who sits on the European Central
Bank's Governing Council.
    A previous critic of Italian fiscal prudence, Weidmann has
been involved in public spats with Italy's government in the
past. In 2016, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told Weidmann
to fix Germany's banks before criticising Rome.
    This open hostility has led some in Italy to question
Weidmann's qualifications to succeed Draghi, and his diplomatic
skills are seen as a disadvantage in the race for the top ECB
job, which comes up at the end of next year.
    ""With this (deficit increase), the structural balance would
deteriorate noticeably, and the very high level of debt would at
best decrease only slightly,"" Weidmann said. 
    He added that concerns over the budget are pushing up the
premium investors demand for holding Italian debt, which
restricts the country's scope for more spending as debt service
costs rise.
    Earlier on Wednesday, EU budget commissioner Guenther
Oettinger said that in his ""personal"" opinion, the EU was very
likely to ask Italy to correct the draft budget.

    MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, PRIME MINISTER OF POLAND
    ""We are having an impasse situation.""
    ""There is a large risk that there can be no agreement. It's

    ""It is urgent to find deals to get a withdrawal agreement.""
    ""British Prime Minister Theresa May must tell us what she
can possibly accept considering the (UK domestic) political
balance.""
    ""We now have to find a solution and an agreement.""

agreement.""
    ""We are not so far but now it's time to find this final
agreement.""
        
    GIUSEPPE CONTE, PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY
    ""(Italy is) available to keep window open on Brexit talks
and to conclude negotiations. But it seems a bit complicated.""
    
    ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR
    ""We want good relations with Britain. We would have been

that it could easily take two years or more to negotiate a new
EU-UK treaty covering everything from economy to trade to
security.""

changing the Italian draft budget for 2019, which the European
Union worries would breach the bloc's fiscal rules and increase
Italy's debt.
    ""We have prepared (the budget) very carefully. Therefore I
think there is no room for change,"" Conte told reporters on
arriving to talks with his fellow EU leaders in Brussels.
    ""I am confident we can have a constructive dialogue,"" he
said, referring to the bloc's executive European Commission,
which is monitors fiscal policies of euro zone states. It has
legal powers to ask Italy to revise its draft budget.
     ""For sure, we will receive comments (...) and will address
them,"" Conte added. Under EU fiscal rules, the Commission has
time until Monday to formally raise concerns with Rome. It could
then reject the budgetary plan by Oct.29.

    By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
    FRANKFURT, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Spain's Santander <SAN.MC> is
the latest bank to be caught up in Germany's biggest post-war
fraud investigation involving a share-trading scheme that the
authorities say cost taxpayers billions of euros.
    In June, prosecutors in Cologne opened a tax investigation
into Santander, confidential documents relating to a state
prosecutors' investigation seen by Reuters and other European
news organisations reveal for the first time.
    Santander's role in the scheme was to carry out trades, the
prosecutors say, as one of many parties involved. They are also
looking at Australia's Macquarie Bank <MQG.AX> and Germany's
Deutsche Bank, <DBKGn.DE> as part of the broader
investigation.   
    A letter from prosecutors to Santander's lawyers sent on
June 4 shows that they suspect the bank of having ""planned and
executed trades"" that facilitated ""severe tax evasion"" from 2007
through 2011.
    A Santander spokesman said that the bank was ""fully
cooperating"" with German authorities and conducting its own
internal investigation. The bank ""doesn't tolerate behaviour""
that fails to comply with the rules and laws in the market where
it operates, he said, adding ""if our investigations do identify
misconduct, we will take appropriate action.""
    Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly
involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of
internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as
part of a European media investigation called the ""cum-ex files""
coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv.
    The prosecutors say the players in the cum-ex scheme misled
the German government into thinking a stock had multiple owners
on its dividend payday who were each owed a dividend and a
dividend tax credit. 
    The prosecutors say the scheme was illegal and misled the
government into paying tax refunds. A spokesman for Santander
declined to comment on whether it had broken the law while a
spokesman for Macquarie, which is also under investigation, said
it had believed the practice to be legal. 
    The documents show that the Cologne prosecutors closed in on
Santander and other banks this year as the investigation, which
began in April 2013, rapidly accelerated.
    The models were designed to generate multiple tax rebates,
prosecutors say. In essence, here is how it worked, according to
the documents viewed by Reuters:
    A bank would agree to sell a company stock, for example to a
pension fund, before the dividend payout but delivered it after
it had been paid. The bank and the fund would both reclaim
withholding tax. 
    Sometimes banks sold shares they did not own and agreed to
buy them later in a practice known as short selling. The stock
was traded rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and
hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners,
prosecutors say. The profits from the deals were shared.
    To generate bigger profits, the pensions funds could also
buy large volumes of stocks, using loans from banks.
    The German tax office wrote to the Cologne prosecutors to
say there were ""concrete indications"" that Santander had acted
as a short seller. Three pension funds had also used loans from
Macquarie, people with direct knowledge of the matter say. 
    ""Macquarie will continue to cooperate fully with the German
authorities,"" a Macquarie spokesman said. ""It has already
resolved its two other matters involving German dividend trading
that took place between 2006 and 2009.""
    The spokesman declined to say how they were resolved.
    Similar investigations have been opened in Frankfurt and
Munich, but Cologne, whose prosecutors specialise in
international tax crime, made a breakthrough when at least six
people involved in the trading gave detailed evidence, according
to the documents.
    Other banks, including Unicredit's German arm, have
acknowledged they were also involved in such trading. 
   A spokeswoman for UniCredit <CRDI.MI> said its German unit
had been involved in cum-ex trading but that all criminal
proceedings had since been terminated after, among other things,
the payment of fines. She declined to comment further.
    A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said it had not participated
in an “organised cum-ex market” but that it had been “involved
in some of its clients’ cum-ex transactions.” It said it was
cooperating with the authorities.
    Referring to all the banks involved, Norbert Walter-Borjans,
the former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, which
includes Cologne, said:  ""They grabbed the kitty that had been
paid for by ordinary tax payers.""
    ""It is clear that it was against the law...How can it be
legal to get something back twice or three times that has been
paid only once?"" he said.    
    
    MISTAKES
    According to the prosecutors, the scheme was promoted by
German tax inspector-turned-tax adviser Hanno Berger and others.
    He advised Macquarie on cum-ex trading, according to a
letter seen by Reuters which was sent by Berger to a Macquarie
employee in March 2008. 
    Berger told Reuters he also provided advice to Macquarie on
the scheme in later years but he said he was not paid for it.
The Macquarie spokesman declined to comment on Berger or the
letter. 
    Macquarie said last month its incoming and outgoing chief
executives are expected to be named as suspects by prosecutors.
The pair were aware of the reputational risk to the bank of the
trades, the documents show. 
    Berger, the central suspect in the investigation who is
living in exile in the Swiss Alps, said the banks used a
legitimate loophole, which was closed in 2012, and did not break
the law.
    ""They (the German state) cannot punish others for their
mistakes,"" he told Reuters.
    Some German officials and prosecutors refute this claim,
noting that Germany made attempts to stamp out the practice by
changing and clarifying the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012. One top
German official, who asked not to be named, said those efforts
made clear the trading was illegal.   
    German authorities estimate the scheme cost the state 5.6
billion euros in tax rebates that should never have been paid,
while some experts believe the damage could be 10 billion euros.
    The state prosecutor in Cologne declined to comment. 
    
    ""REPUTATIONAL RISK""
    The documents show that the prosecutors in Cologne made a
major breakthrough last year when a group of bankers, including
a former Macquarie employee, offered information that showed
Santander, Macquarie and others profited from the scheme. 
    Macquarie estimates that it may have to pay 100 million
euros in total legal settlements from the trades, roughly half
of which it has already paid, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. 
    Internal Macquarie emails show that outgoing CEO Nicholas
Moore and his successor in waiting, Shemara Wikramanayake, were
aware of the reputational risks of the trades and involved in
discussions about the funding.  A spokesman for Macquarie said
Moore and Wikramanayake would not comment. 
    In October 2010, Wikramanayake and three other executives
sent a memorandum seen by Reuters to Macquarie's board of
directors. It outlined a funding opportunity that would earn
Macquarie between 15 and 20 million euros on each of three 1.1
billion euro loan facilities.
    It earned a fee for these loan facilities.
    ""There is a risk that German revenue authorities may seek to
deny tax reclaims and take some other action against the parties
involved,"" they wrote.
    They said the ""anticipated returns"" should be weighed
against the negative ""reputational risk"".
    Wikramanayake and Moore attended part of a meeting of
directors on October 28 2010 in Sydney, when the deals and the
""reputation risk"" were discussed, according to minutes of the
meeting seen by Reuters. 
    The conditional approval for the funding was given at that
meeting before the formal signoff in early 2011, according to
the documents. 
    The Macquarie spokesman said the bank lent money to a group
of investment funds in 2011 which traded shares that sought to
""obtain the benefit of dividend withholding tax credits"" but he
said the German authorities refused those claims. 
    The German authorities declined to comment. 
    ""Macquarie received extensive external legal advice in
relation to its involvement and believed that it was acting
lawfully,"" he said.
    
    SANTANDER LINK
    Prosecutors wrote in letters to Santander's lawyers that
they believe the Spanish bank, and its UK subsidiary Abbey
National Treasury Services, were actively involved in ""a large
number"" of deals involving short sales - a critical part of the
cycle that created the impression of multiple share owners.
    The Santander spokesman said that to the bank’s
understanding, the investigation was focused on three former
employees. 
    “To date we have not identified any evidence that the
activities under investigation involved senior management or
that any of Santander’s or its subsidiaries' governing bodies
were aware of these activities,” said the spokesman.
    The bank executed transactions for a number of U.S. pension
funds and its customer Macquarie, prosecutors said, which
allowed the funds to make what tax investigators say are
""illicit"" tax reclaims. The prosecutors do not say how many
pension funds.
    Those services were lucrative for both Santander and
Macquarie, the documents show.
    For example, on May 13, 2011, the New York-based Sander
Gerber pension plan received dividends of almost 162 million
euros as a result of the trades supported by the two banks,
according to the documents.
    Macquarie charged a fee of 4 percent, or 6.5 million euros,
to the pension plan for its services. Santander received an
additional 400,000 euros in fees  for the 'futures facility' it
provided.
    A spokesman for Sander Gerber said that its investment
decision relied on the ""reputation and integrity"" of the banks
and that Gerber had understood the investment products to be
""legitimate"".
    Germany wants the banks to repay the 5.6 billion euros, the
German official told Reuters. Banks have already repaid 2.3
billion euros in settlements, the official said.
    Frankfurt prosecutors this year filed the first criminal
charges against Berger and five others who are all former
employees of the German unit of Unicredit, according to court
documents seen by Reuters. Unicredit declined to comment.
    Although the investigation has gathered pace and some of the
banks have repaid money, pursuing them and other suspects has
been difficult, some lawmakers say. This is because, like
Berger, several have moved abroad.
    One German prosecutor admitted it would take years to bring
those involved to justice but that the prosecution sent a clear
signal that such wrongdoing would not be tolerated.

    By Tomo Uetake
    TOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - China's benchmark stock index
skidded to four-year lows and dragged Asian equities down on
Thursday, as renewed fears of a broadening economic impact from
an escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict sapped confidence.
    The dollar, however, was in fine fettle, hitting a one-week
high after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting
backed market expectations for borrowing costs to rise further.
    While the Fed's policy outlook suggested the U.S. economy
was humming along nicely, the spectre of rising dollar yields,
which along with trade tensions were at the centre of last
week's global equities rout, dented appetite for risk.
  China's stock markets were hit hard, with the nation's premier
warning that the economy faces increasing downward
pressure.[nL3N1WX61B] 
     MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.5 percent.
    China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> shed as
much as 2.2 percent to hit its lowest level in four years, while
the blue-chip CSI 300 index <.CSI300> dropped as much as 1.8
percent, not far from its more than two-year low marked previous
day.
    Analysts at Pingan Securities said in a note that lending
data released on Wednesday failed to reassure investors looking
for more government support amid signs of slowing growth.
[nL3N1WX61N]
    ""The overall falling trend of total social financing growth
remains unchanged, and the loosening of the credit situation
that the market has been waiting for has not yet emerged.""
    The rest of Asia also struggled, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index <.HSI> easing 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei average
<.N225> slipping 0.7 percent.
    Data out earlier in the day showed exports from the world's
third-biggest economy dropped for the first time since late
2016, hit by declines in shipments to the United States and
China. [nL3N1WX2JE]
    The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> and Treasury yields rose to its
highest levels in a week on Wednesday. 
    The dollar index, which measures its value against six major
peers, last traded at 95.703, little changed on the day, after
rising to a fresh one week-high earlier in the day. 10 year
Treasury yield last stood at 3.210 percent, 2.8 basis points
higher than the U.S. close.
     The euro <EUR=> changed hands at $1.1496, holding steady
versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on Wednesday.
The euro has lost just under 3 percent of its value versus the
dollar over the last three weeks.
    The minutes from the Fed's Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every
Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and
also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further,
despite U.S. President Donald Trump's view that the tightenings
have already gone too far. [nL2N1WX1DX]
    Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S.
government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China or any
other trading partner as a currency manipulator, as it leans on
import tariffs to try to cut a trade deficit with China,
soothing investor sentiment in Asia.
    In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury
Department said a recent depreciation of China's yuan currency
will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, but U.S.
officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly
intervene in the currency's value. [nL2N1WX1WS]
    The yuan was steady at 6.9390 per dollar <CNH=D4> in the
offshore trade, not far off 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in
August.
    But some investors remain wary of a slide towards the
psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar. [nL3N1WX15N]
    ""The continued risk of a fresh bout of weakness (in the
yuan) cannot be ignored"" with U.S. Treasury yields beginning to
creep higher again, Trump hinting at further tariffs on Chinese
goods and the Chinese stocks hitting a multi-year lows, said
Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
     In Europe, the European Council meeting kicked off on
Wednesday with a roundtable dinner, with British Prime Minister
Theresa May's address ahead of it, though expectations that
anything substantial will come out of it have already been
fading. [nL8N1WX5ZQ]
    ""Hopes for Brexit deal has supported the pound for the past
two months. So if there's no meaningful development, other than
longer transition period, the pound could come under short-term
selling pressure,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of markets research
at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. 
    Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures settling
below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S.
crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what
analysts had forecast, while exports dropped. [O/R]
    The West Texas Intermediate crude futures <CLc1> and Brent
crude futures <LCOc1> last traded at $69.79 and $80.07 a barrel,
respectively.

    ISTANBUL, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Turkish investigators searched
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul overnight as part of a probe
into Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance, while U.S. President
Donald Trump said he did not want to abandon his Saudi ally over
the missing journalist. 
    The crime scene team left the Saudi consulate early on
Thursday after searching the building and consular vehicles, a
Reuters witness said. They used bright lights to illuminate the
garden, although it was unclear what they were doing.
    Earlier, investigators spent nearly nine hours in the Saudi
consul's residence before leaving, as did Saudi investigators.
The search by the Turkish team included the roof and garage and
the deployment of a drone over the area.
    Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi, a
Washington Post columnist who was critical of the authoritarian
kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered at the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and his body removed.
    The Saudis have denied the allegations.
    U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was waiting
for a full report on what had happened to Khashoggi from
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whom he sent to Saudi Arabia and
Turkey to meet officials over Khashoggi's disappearance. Trump
and Pompeo are scheduled to meet at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on
Thursday. [nL8N1WX0ZL]
    Trump, who has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and the
33-year-old crown prince, said the United States has asked
Turkey for any audio or video evidence. 
    Turkish sources have told Reuters the authorities have an
audio recording indicating Khashoggi was killed inside the
consulate. He has not been seen since entering the building.
    Turkey's pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper published on
Wednesday what it said were details from audio recordings that
purported to document Khashoggi's torture and interrogation.
    The newspaper said Khashoggi was killed within minutes and
his torturers severed his fingers during the interrogation. His
killers later beheaded and dismembered him, it said.
    Turkey has not shared with the U.S. government or European
allies graphic audio or video evidence, seven U.S. and European
security officials told Reuters. The United States and allies
have collected some intelligence through their own sources and
methods, which partly confirms news reports based on leaks of
audio recordings, four of the sources said. [nL8N1WX0ZL]
    A New York Times report cited a senior Turkish official
confirming the details published by Yeni Safak. Two Turkish
government officials contacted by Reuters declined to confirm
the report.
    U.S. media outlets have reported that Riyadh, despite its
earlier denials of involvement, will acknowledge that Khashoggi
was killed in a botched interrogation. Trump has speculated
without providing evidence that ""rogue killers"" could be
responsible.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES DIP: THE OPEN NOT LOOKING SO FLAT AFTER ALL (0608 GMT) 
    With Asia slightly in the red and Wall Street futures trading in negative territory, it's
perhaps not that surprising that European futures wouldn't open in the black. 
    Looks also that the declining pound (-0.18 pct) is ready to give a gentle boost to the FTSE,
with its future up 0.1 percent.
    But overall it seems like spreadbetters expecting a slightly positive start of the session
might have been a tad optimistic:

    UK RETAIL SALES AND BREXIT DRAMA (0555 GMT) 
    Attention FTSE watchers: if the pound didn't get a proper beating from the lack of results
from the Brexit summit last night, it might come a little bit later this morning at 0830 GMT. 
    ""Pound traders will look to focus on UK retail sales data as a break from the Brexit drama,""
wrote Jasper Lawler from LCG, warning that ""this may not be a good thing"".
    Lawler believes ""there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead
of the Christmas period,"" an opinion shared by CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. 
    ""Given the decent summer it wouldn’t be unexpected to see consumers pare back their spending
once the schools go back, with expectations of a 0.4% decline."" 
    Quite possible the FTSE then gets a boost from a faltering sterling in morning trading if
retail data proves disappointing. 
    Perhaps as a sign of the sensitivity of retail data, Tuesday's figures from Kantar had quite
an impact with shares in Tesco and Sainsbury dropping on sluggish growth. 
   See: Tesco and Sainsbury's post weak growth, lose market share - Kantar [nL8N1WW1RY]
    (Julien Ponthus) 
    *****
    
    
    MORNING CALL: A FLAT START? (0518 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to start the session pretty much unchanged with very little
enthusiasm coming from Asia where the MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.4 percent. 
    No breakthrough from the Brexit summit this morning and the main attention of markets seems
to be the dollar at a one week-high after the Fed minutes showed broad agreement on tightening
further. 
    The Q3 season has yet to start in earnest, but among interesting results this morning are
SAP, Thales or Carrefour. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 5 points higher, Frankfurt's DAX to
rise 6 points and Paris' CAC to edge up 2 points.

Industry and Commerce has cut its 2018 growth forecast for
Europe's largest economy to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent and
forecast a slow-down to 1.7 percent next year.
    ""Companies are noticeably more cautious about their business
outlook, we see the biggest deterioration in business
expectations in four years,"" the DIHK said on Thursday.
    According to its autumn survey entitled ""The air is getting
thinner"", companies scaled back their business expectations to
11 points from 17 points in spring. Business morale regarding
current conditions remained stable at 45 points.
    The DIHK's survey of around 27,000 managers, the biggest of
its kind in Germany, found that companies viewed shortages of
skilled labour and rising labour costs as the principal risks
for their business outlook.
    ""Given the rapid pace of change, for example in global trade
policies or digitalization - and the unclear outcome of Brexit,
it is becoming more difficult for companies to foresee a clear
trend in their business development,"" DIHK said.

higher on Thursday as a flurry of corporate trading updates
somewhat quelled fears of fast-rising U.S. interest rates amid
ongoing concerns the Sino-U.S. trade conflict could escalate and

    EUROPEAN FUTURES DIP: THE OPEN NOT LOOKING SO FLAT AFTER ALL (0608 GMT) 
    With Asia slightly in the red and Wall Street futures trading in negative territory, it's
perhaps not that surprising that European futures wouldn't open in the black. 
    Looks also that the declining pound (-0.18 pct) is ready to give a gentle boost to the FTSE,
with its future up 0.1 percent.
    But overall it seems like spreadbetters expecting a slightly positive start of the session
might have been a tad optimistic:

    UK RETAIL SALES AND BREXIT DRAMA (0555 GMT) 
    Attention FTSE watchers: if the pound didn't get a proper beating from the lack of results
from the Brexit summit last night, it might come a little bit later this morning at 0830 GMT. 
    ""Pound traders will look to focus on UK retail sales data as a break from the Brexit drama,""
wrote Jasper Lawler from LCG, warning that ""this may not be a good thing"".
    Lawler believes ""there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead
of the Christmas period,"" an opinion shared by CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. 
    ""Given the decent summer it wouldn’t be unexpected to see consumers pare back their spending
once the schools go back, with expectations of a 0.4% decline."" 
    Quite possible the FTSE then gets a boost from a faltering sterling in morning trading if
retail data proves disappointing. 
    Perhaps as a sign of the sensitivity of retail data, Tuesday's figures from Kantar had quite
an impact with shares in Tesco and Sainsbury dropping on sluggish growth.

    MORNING CALL: A FLAT START? (0518 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to start the session pretty much unchanged with very little
enthusiasm coming from Asia where the MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.4 percent. 
    No breakthrough from the Brexit summit this morning and the main attention of markets seems
to be the dollar at a one week-high after the Fed minutes showed broad agreement on tightening
further. 
    The Q3 season has yet to start in earnest, but among interesting results this morning are
SAP, Thales or Carrefour. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 5 points higher, Frankfurt's DAX to
rise 6 points and Paris' CAC to edge up 2 points.

    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - There is around a 70 percent
chance that Britain and the European Union will reach a Brexit
deal at the last minute, credit agency Euler Hermes said on
Thursday.
    ""For companies that would be like a 'blind date' because
they wouldn't know what they've got coming,"" Ludovic Subran,
chief economist at Euler Hermes, said.
    ""The details could contain good or bad surprises but for
companies it would still be better than an ugly divorce,"" he
added.
    If a Brexit deal were reached, the exchange rate between the
British pound and the euro would probably climb to 1.14 after an
expected trough of between 1.06 and 1.09 by the end of 2018,
Euler Hermes said.
    It said it saw a 25 percent likelihood of Britain quitting
the bloc without a deal and said this would result in customs of
around 4 to 5 percent for both Britain and the EU as well as a
big depreciation in pound sterling - probably to 0.88 euros by
the end of 2019.
    That would cause a drop in exports, it said.
    Euler Hermes said uncertainty due to Brexit was likely to
shave up to 0.1 percentage points off British economic growth
every quarter until an agreement was reached.
    It said it was seeing signs of British companies
increasingly hoarding imported goods that were indispensable for
their production so they could avoid possible customs and delays
or disruptions to their supply chains.
    It said a hard Brexit - generally understood to mean Britain
distancing itself from the EU by leaving the single market and
the customs union - would have a huge economic impact, hurting
Britain the most while exports from Germany, the Netherlands,
France and Belgium would also suffer.
    There is a 5 percent chance of Britain remaining in the EU,
Euler Hermes said.

chief executive of French defence electronics group Thales
<TCFP.PA>, has decided not to attend a Saudi investment
conference next week, amid global concerns over the fate of a
missing Saudi journalist.

Riyadh from Oct 23-Oct 25, by Jean-Loic Galle, who is an
executive at Thales' space division.
    The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has
raised concerns around the world.
    Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi, a
Washington Post columnist who was critical of the authoritarian
kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered at the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and his body removed. The
Saudis have denied the allegations.
    The French state owns 26 percent of Thales while Dassault
Aviation <AVMD.PA> has a 25 percent stake.

 (Adds details after retail sales data)
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The British pound recovered to
trade flat on Thursday after Prime Minister Theresa May
confirmed she was open to discussing an extension of the
transition period after Brexit.
    Sterling was steady at $1.3114 <GBP=D3>, after earlier
dipping to $1.3076, although it briefly took a hit after data
showed UK retail sales fell by the most in six months in
September. [nL9N0FN02R]
    At a dinner in Brussels on Wednesday evening, May assured EU
leaders she can still reach a Brexit deal. But she also said
Britain was open to extending the transition period after the UK
departs the European Union, although she did not think it would
ever need to be used. May reiterated those comments on
Thursday.[nL8N1WY1X5]
    Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC, said an
extension to the transition period made the need for a so-called
backstop - a proposal aimed at avoiding the imposition of a hard
border across Ireland after Brexit, and one of the thorniest
issues to overcome in agreeing a deal - less likely. 
    ""It remains to be seen if Brexiteers in her party can be
persuaded to sign on,"" Lignos said. 
    Against the euro the pound was down 0.2 percent at 87.89
pence per euro <EURGBP=D3>, as its losses extended after the
retail sales numbers.
    UK retail sales volumes dropped by 0.8 percent in September
from August - a bigger fall than economists had expected in a
Reuters poll - after the largest decline in food purchases since
October 2015, official data showed.
    A flurry of data this week, including the strongest wage
growth for a decade, have briefly focused traders' attention on
the UK economy and away from Brexit negotiations, although
investors say the pound remains at the mercy of the talks.
    ""We’ve had three data points from the UK in the last three
days with only the unemployment figures providing any real
support for the pound,"" David Cheetham, chief market analyst at
broker XTB, said. 
    ""Despite this, sterling continues to keep calm and carry on
despite the obvious Brexit threat with negotiations on this
front clearly not progressing as many would’ve hoped.""

    By Julien Ponthus and Josephine Mason
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European shares traded slightly
higher on Thursday as a flurry of corporate trading updates
quelled fears of fast-rising U.S. interest rates amid ongoing
concerns the Sino-U.S. trade conflict could escalate and hurt
the global economy.  
    At 0837 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark
index was up 0.3 percent with bourses across the continent in
positive territory.
    ""European markets have opened mixed this morning, shrugging
off a disappointing session in Asia, where the reaction to last
nights Fed minutes was anything but positive,"" said Michael
Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
    Minutes from a recent meeting showed Federal Reserve
policymakers are largely united on the need to raise borrowing
costs further despite President Donald Trump's view that
interest rate hikes have already gone too far. [nL2N1WX1DX]
    Meanwhile, Europe's third-quarter earnings season is kicking
up a gear after indexes hit a 22-month low last week when
jitters over rising U.S. bond yields and geopolitical worries
rattled global markets.
    French supermarket operator Carrefour <CARR.PA> was the top
gainer in early trading, up 7.5 percent as sales acceleration in
France and Brazil overshadowed weakness in Southern Europe.
[nL8N1WX5WG]
    Media <.SXMP> was the best performing sector, up 1.7
percent, lifted by France's Publicis <PUBP.PA> which regained
some footing in the third-quarter and jumped 6.5 percent. 
    The telecom sector <.SXKP> was also well in the black, up
1.1 percent with Sweden's Tele2 <TEL2b.ST>, lifting its guidance
after better-than-expected results and rising 5.7
percent.[nFWN1WX14W]
    Novartis <NOVN.S> rose 2.1 percent after announcing it would
 acquire U.S.-based cancer drugmaker Endocyte <ECYT.O> for $2.1
billion in cash as the Swiss drugmaker expands its
radiopharmaceuticals business. 
    Some updates disappointed however and HeidelbergCement
<HEIG.DE>, one of the world's largest cement makers, fell close
to 10 percent as it trimmed its profit guidance for 2018, citing
bad weather in the United States and higher-than-expected energy
cost inflation. [nL8N1WY1E2]
    Other European cement makers suffered with Buzzi Unicem
<BZU.MI> falling 5.9 percent, LafargeHolcim <LHN.S> 4.3 percent
and CRH <CRH.I> down 4.2 percent.

 (Adds more EU comment, British reaction)
    By Elizabeth Piper and Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May signalled on Thursday she would consider extending a
so-called transition period ""for a matter of months"" after
Britain leaves the European Union, a move her critics say is a
betrayal of Brexit.
    Less than six months before Britain quits the EU in its
biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years, Brexit talks
have stalled over how to deal with their only land border,
between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland.
    At an EU summit in Brussels, while the mood was more upbeat
about the willingness for a deal to ease Britain's exit, several
leaders and diplomats said May had offered nothing new to strike
the kind of breakthrough needed to move forward. [nL8N1WX5ZQ]
    The problem centres on a so-called backstop - an insurance
policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the
island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions,
if a future trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Extending the transition period could mean that if a future
partnership is not ready, a backstop, which so far has been
unpalatable to the British side, would not have to be triggered.
But even an extension will not get rid of the EU's insistence
that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal.
    ""A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at this
stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation
period for a matter of months, and it would only be a matter
months,"" May told reporters on the second day of the summit.
    ""But the point is, this is not expected to be used because
we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship
in place by the end of December 2020.""
    May has tried to use the summit in Brussels - once seen as
the stage for a possible breakthrough after more than a year of
talks - to offer a softer tone to her EU counterparts after
another such meeting last month ended in acrimony.
    Before leaving them to dine on Wednesday, May urged them to
work together. ""We have shown we can do difficult deals together
constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome,"" she told
the leaders, according to a British official. ""The last stage
will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.""
    
    ""DESPERATE""
    EU leaders offered some understanding of May's predicament.
    The British leader's plans have been criticised by all sides
- Brexit campaigners accuse her of making Britain a vassal
state, EU supporters say they offer the worst of all worlds and
others have expressed frustration over the lengthy talks.
    She also faces a rebellion from her parliamentary partners,
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which has
threatened to vote against her government's budget if she
concedes to the EU's demands over the backstop. They say the
proposal would tear Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain.
    With a crucial vote in parliament on any deal, May, who lost
her Conservative Party's majority in an election last year, 
risks a damaging defeat. That could trigger a leadership
contest, a so-called no deal Brexit and even a new election.
    The parliamentary vote, and May's political struggles, were
the focus of much of the other EU leaders' dinner late on
Wednesday, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said. 
    But a senior EU diplomat was more blunt. ""There is nothing.
We have nothing. For now, we have a no-deal,"" the diplomat said,
adding leaders were waiting for Britain's budget, due to be
presented to parliament in late October, to be passed.
    With the talks stalled and little prospect of a quickening
of pace anytime soon, many Brexit supporters and even critics of
Britain's departure are airing their frustration over an exit
which some campaigners had said would be the easiest deal ever.
    And the suggestion -- first made by EU negotiators -- that
Britain could stay firmly in the EU's sphere for longer than the
21 months expected has fired up those who already say Britain
has already given up too much in the negotiations.
    ""Many Conservative MPs (lawmakers) are making clear to the
government that we won't support legislation seeking to prolong
transition and large payments for no good reason,"" said John
Redwood, a Conservative Brexit supporter.
    ""Extending our period under EU control would take us into
another seven year spending period and it would want even more
money from us.""

    BREXIT FATIGUE (1032 GMT) 
    Funny how last night's fruitless Brexit summit isn't seen as such a bad thing after all! 
    The pound is back to positive territory as Britain being open to extending the transition
period for leaving the EU is greeted with relief. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    A few voices however expressed some degree of despair at the prospect of longer divorce
talks. 
    ""The transition part of the interminably tedious divorce process may be more interminable -
lasting 33 months, not 21 months,"" complained Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth
Management.
    ""To force us to keep talking about this nonsense for another year seems a cruel and
unnatural punishment,"" he says while weariness about the whole issue is palpable.    
    ""Markets appear to be viewing the Brexit negotiations with the same exhaustion as everyone
else, as both sides play for time,"" is IG analyst Chris Beauchamp's take. 
    Indeed, Brexit, as a structural issue for markets, isn't going away anytime soon. 
    ""In short, we are unlikely to know for sure whether 'no deal' has been averted until much
closer to the UK's scheduled exit date in March,"" reckons ActivTrades technical analyst Pierre
Veyret. 
    As noted by our Buzz team [nL2N1WY06U], we most probably are heading into an extra-volatile
end of the year. 
    Here's how the Daily Mail expressed its feelings about a longer transition period this
morning:

    AND IT'S UP...(0744 GMT) 
    It has proven tricky to call the market earlier on this morning but it now seems safe to say
that the mood is gradually switching to 'risk-on'.
    Clearly the flurry of trading updates has something to do with investor morale changing
course to the upside. 
    Telecoms, Media, Retail and Healthcare are leading the charge with key groups from these
sectors rising following upbeat results. For our top equity stories this morning, click on

    EUROPEAN FUTURES DIP: THE OPEN NOT LOOKING SO FLAT AFTER ALL (0608 GMT) 
    With Asia slightly in the red and Wall Street futures trading in negative territory, it's
perhaps not that surprising that European futures wouldn't open in the black. 
    Looks also that the declining pound (-0.18 pct) is ready to give a gentle boost to the FTSE,
with its future up 0.1 percent.
    But overall it seems like spreadbetters expecting a slightly positive start of the session
might have been a tad optimistic:

    UK RETAIL SALES AND BREXIT DRAMA (0555 GMT) 
    Attention FTSE watchers: if the pound didn't get a proper beating from the lack of results
from the Brexit summit last night, it might come a little bit later this morning at 0830 GMT. 
    ""Pound traders will look to focus on UK retail sales data as a break from the Brexit drama,""
wrote Jasper Lawler from LCG, warning that ""this may not be a good thing"".
    Lawler believes ""there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead
of the Christmas period,"" an opinion shared by CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. 
    ""Given the decent summer it wouldn’t be unexpected to see consumers pare back their spending
once the schools go back, with expectations of a 0.4% decline."" 
    Quite possible the FTSE then gets a boost from a faltering sterling in morning trading if
retail data proves disappointing. 
    Perhaps as a sign of the sensitivity of retail data, Tuesday's figures from Kantar had quite
an impact with shares in Tesco and Sainsbury dropping on sluggish growth.

    MORNING CALL: A FLAT START? (0518 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to start the session pretty much unchanged with very little
enthusiasm coming from Asia where the MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.4 percent. 
    No breakthrough from the Brexit summit this morning and the main attention of markets seems
to be the dollar at a one week-high after the Fed minutes showed broad agreement on tightening
further. 
    The Q3 season has yet to start in earnest, but among interesting results this morning are
SAP, Thales or Carrefour. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 5 points higher, Frankfurt's DAX to
rise 6 points and Paris' CAC to edge up 2 points.

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Scotland's government said on
Thursday that a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
or mad cow disease, had been discovered on a farm in
Aberdeenshire.
    A quarantine area has been put in place around the farm
while inspectors try to identify the origin of the disease.
    The government said the case posed no harm to humans.
    ""I have activated the Scottish government's response plan to
protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a
precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm,"" Scotland's
farming minister Fergus Ewing said in a statement.
    BSE was first detected in Britain in the late 1980s,
spreading from there to other parts of Europe and ravaging
cattle herds until the early 2000s. It has been linked to the
brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union defended
proposed new derivatives clearing rules on Thursday after
criticism from the United States, saying the bloc has every
right to supervise foreign financial firms that serve EU
customers.
    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair
Christopher Giancarlo threatened retaliation on Wednesday unless
the EU watered down the draft rules, which set out tougher
conditions for foreign clearing houses doing business in the
bloc. [nL8N1WX2II]
    They include allowing EU regulators to directly supervise
foreign clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.
    For two regulators to air their differences so publicly is
rare.
    European Commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke said the
proposed EU regulations were actually based on existing U.S.
rules.
    ""It is the prerogative of the EU legislator to set the
general supervisory framework for central counterparties (CCPs)
active in the EU and we would expect third country authorities
to respect that, just as we respect the rules and legislative
procedures in other countries,"" Bahrke said in a statement.
    ""We reiterate that the cooperative oversight
we have proposed is modelled for systemically important
cross-border CCPs on the United States' own supervisory system,""
Bahrke said.
    The EU rules were drawn up in response to Britain's
departure from the bloc, which will result in Europe's biggest
clearing house for euro-denominated transactions like interest
rate swaps, London-based LCH <LSE.L>, being located outside the
bloc.
    Unless the Bank of England agrees to joint supervision of
LCH, the clearer may have to shift euro-denominated operations
to the EU or risk losing the business.
    The draft rules have led to accusations of regulatory
overreach in the United States, home to clearers like CME
<CME.O> and ICE <ICE.N>.
    Giancarlo said that unless the EU rules were watered down so
that the bloc's regulators ""defer"" to U.S. counterparts when it
comes to supervising American clearing houses, the CFTC could
effectively bar U.S. securities houses from trading on EU
exchanges. 
    Latest figures from the EU's securities watchdog ESMA on the
bloc's 660 trillion euro derivatives market, published on
Thursday, highlighted London's dominance in heavily traded
products like interest rate swaps.   
    Bahrke said the EU is globally the most open jurisdiction
when it comes to deferring to equivalent third country
regulators, and offers greater deference to the CFTC than vice
versa.
    ""The objective of the proposed new framework of CCP
supervision is to maintain that openness and adapt our
supervisory framework to the evolving circumstances in European
derivatives markets,"" Bahrke said. 
    ""We look forward to continuing the dialogue on this matter.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
discuss on Thursday how to make the euro zone more resilient to
crises, with the bloc's third biggest economy, Italy, putting
new urgency into the talks by challenging EU budget rules that
underpin the single currency.
    Leaders of all EU countries except Britain are to take stock
of progress in completing the euro zone's banking union and
granting new powers to its ESM bailout fund as the 19 countries
sharing the euro prepare for decisions to be taken in December. 
    ""We are ... looking for some guidance from leaders on topics
like the fiscal capacity,"" Mario Centeno, the chairman of euro
zone finance ministers, told reporters on entering the summit.
    ""I see growing interest in some member states in specific
issues related to the fiscal capacity, for example the
unemployment reinsurance system,"" he said.
    The reforms under consideration so far are to ensure that
the euro zone would have enough money in case of a major banking
crisis to resolve failing banks and to prevent bank runs by
setting up a euro zone-wide deposit guarantee scheme.
    The ESM is to get new powers of regularly monitoring
economies so that it could be ready at a moment's notice to step
in with a full bailout programme of reforms in exchange for
cheap loans if a sovereign were cut off from markets, possibly
after managing a debt restructuring if necessary.
    The fund is also to have the possibility of lending with
minimal conditions to euro zone governments that have been
conducting sound economic policy, but were hit by external
crises not of their own making.
    
    ITALY MAKES EURO ZONE REFORM MORE DIFFICULT
    But all these discussions, controversial from the start
because they involve sharing financial risks, have now been made
much more difficult by Italy, where a populist government wants
to finance higher spending and lower taxes with more borrowing.
    Italy has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe and
the highest debt servicing costs and because its economy grows
slowly, officials are concerned that more debt could trigger
another debt crisis like the one set of by Greece in 2010 that
nearly destroyed the euro zone.
    ""I am absolutely aware that the atmosphere is more tricky
than in June,"" the chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk said this
week when asked how Italy's fiscal plans would affect deeper
euro zone integration agreed on at a summit in June.
    ""But I think we can use the time before December to clarify
the position of some member states and our goal remains to have
visible progress in December,"" Tusk said.
    Privately, euro zone officials acknowledge that Rome's plans
only strengthened the opposition from those sceptical about
financial risk sharing.
    ""It is going to be more difficult now. At the moment when
you talk about deposit insurance the appetite for it is
smaller,"" one official involved in the talks said.
    ""Italy is now an additional argument not to even think about
it. And Germany, the Netherlands who have always said it is not
needed at all, of course they have now one argument more,"" he
said.
    Officials also worry that Italy may link its support for
whatever ideas are in the end agreed in the euro zone
integration process, with the EU's consent for its higher
borrowing in the 2019 budget.
    Under EU rules, highly indebted countries like Italy should
cut their deficit and debt every year, but Rome argues that the
higher borrowing would spur faster economic growth and debt
would fall as percentage of GDP in the end.
    The Commission rejects this, noting the resulting growth
would have to be very high for the argument to hold and that
borrowing more to reduce debt was not the way to go.
    ""If the confrontation intensifies, Italy can block any
consensus at the summit. That is a real risk,"" one official
said. ""That would not be the end of Europe, but it would be
disappointing because of all the work that has gone into this.""

 (Adds senior UK government official, French official, DUP)
    By Elizabeth Piper and Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May signalled on Thursday she would consider extending a
so-called transition period ""for a matter of months"" after
Britain leaves the European Union, a move her critics say is a
betrayal of Brexit.
    Less than six months before Britain quits the EU in its
biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years, Brexit talks
have stalled over how to deal with their only land border,
between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland.
    At an EU summit in Brussels, while the mood was more upbeat
about the willingness for a deal to ease Britain's exit, several
leaders and diplomats said May had offered nothing new to strike
the kind of breakthrough needed to move forward. [nL8N1WX5ZQ]
    The problem centres on a so-called backstop - an insurance
policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the
island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions,
if a future trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Extending the transition period could mean that if a future
partnership is not ready, a backstop, which so far has been
unpalatable to the British side, would not have to be triggered.
But even an extension will not get rid of the EU's insistence
that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal.
    ""A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at this
stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation
period for a matter of months, and it would only be a matter
months,"" May told reporters on the second day of the summit.
    ""But the point is, this is not expected to be used because
we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship
in place by the end of December 2020.""
    A senior British government official tried to play down the
significance of May's consideration of such an extension, saying
it had only ""come up in negotiations in recent days"" and that it
was one of several options to help move the talks on - something
London desperately wants to see. [nS8N1WV05Q]
    And a French official said any extension would come with
conditions attached - it would not be automatic, it would be
decided closer to the time and that it would have to be agreed
by the leaders of the 27 other EU nations, probably unanimously.
    
    ""TRUST""
    May has tried to use the summit in Brussels - once seen as
the stage for a possible breakthrough after more than a year of
talks - to offer a softer tone to her EU counterparts after
another such meeting last month ended in acrimony.
    Before leaving them to dine on Wednesday, May called for
cooperation. ""The last stage will need courage, trust and
leadership on both sides,"" she told leaders, according to an
official.
    Her plea was met by some understanding of her predicament.
    May's plans have been criticised by all sides at home --
Brexit campaigners accuse her of making Britain a vassal state,
EU supporters say they offer the worst of all worlds and others
have expressed frustration over the lengthy talks.
    She also faces a rebellion from her parliamentary partners,
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which has
threatened to vote against her government's budget if she
concedes to the EU's demands over the backstop. They say the
proposal would tear Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain.
    Diane Dodds, an EU lawmaker from the DUP, said the extension
did not ease her party's fears. ""All very well, but this doesn't
do anything to actually change the backstop ... Therefore it
does not address any concerns, it offers no reassurance.""
    With a crucial vote in parliament on any deal, May, who lost
her Conservative Party's majority in an election last year, 
risks a damaging defeat. That could trigger a leadership
contest, a so-called no deal Brexit and even a new election.
    The parliamentary vote, and May's political struggles, were
the focus of much of the other EU leaders' dinner late on
Wednesday, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said. 
    But a senior EU diplomat was more blunt. ""There is nothing.
We have nothing. For now, we have a no-deal,"" the diplomat said,
adding leaders were waiting for Britain's budget, due to be
presented to parliament in late October, to be passed.
    With the talks stalled and little prospect of a quickening
of pace anytime soon, many Brexit supporters and even critics of
Britain's departure are airing their frustration over an exit
which some campaigners had said would be the easiest deal ever.
    And the suggestion -- first made by EU negotiators -- that
Britain could stay firmly in the EU's sphere for longer than the
21 months expected has fired up those who already say Britain
has already given up too much in the negotiations.
    ""Many Conservative MPs (lawmakers) are making clear to the
government that we won't support legislation seeking to prolong
transition and large payments for no good reason,"" said John
Redwood, a Conservative Brexit supporter.

    SEATBELT SIGNS ON: AIRLINES EXPERIENCING TURBULENCE (1103 GMT)
    While Air France's <AIRF.PA> shares are rising strongly on hopes of a pay deal with unions,
airlines have broadly been among the worst performing this month with Flybe <FLYB.L> sinking 40
percent yesterday. Its profit warning sent peers across the sector tumbling as investors
realised rising fuel prices would likely dent airlines' profits.
    As you can see below, the MSCI Europe airlines index is down sharply this year and at an
18-month low. The sector's lost a quarter of its market value since Jan 1, and a whopping 10.9
percent in October. 
    ""Rising fuel and soft yield trends in the face of weakening capacity discipline raise
industry-specific concerns, even before we contemplate macro-economic risks, Brexit and
trade-related uncertainty,"" write HSBC analysts, who've cut estimates for their whole airline
coverage to factor in higher fuel costs. 
    With competition so intense particularly for budget short-haul airlines, the only hope is
for further M&A in the industry. 
    ""To stabilise or indeed strengthen profitability, airlines need to see capacity moderation
and consolidation,"" they write. 
    HSBC also downgrades Norwegian <NWC.OL> to reduce, sending the shares down 4.6 percent.
    ""It's a tough time for European short haul air travel and it could be another opportunity
for the big players to hoover up smaller operators and/or their routes,"" says Neil Wilson,
analyst at markets.com.

    BREXIT FATIGUE (1032 GMT) 
    Funny how last night's fruitless Brexit summit isn't seen as such a bad thing after all! 
    The pound is back to positive territory as Britain being open to extending the transition
period for leaving the EU is greeted with relief. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    A few voices however expressed some degree of despair at the prospect of longer divorce
talks. 
    ""The transition part of the interminably tedious divorce process may be more interminable -
lasting 33 months, not 21 months,"" complained Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth
Management.
    ""To force us to keep talking about this nonsense for another year seems a cruel and
unnatural punishment,"" he says while weariness about the whole issue is palpable.    
    ""Markets appear to be viewing the Brexit negotiations with the same exhaustion as everyone
else, as both sides play for time,"" is IG analyst Chris Beauchamp's take. 
    Indeed, Brexit, as a structural issue for markets, isn't going away anytime soon. 
    ""In short, we are unlikely to know for sure whether 'no deal' has been averted until much
closer to the UK's scheduled exit date in March,"" reckons ActivTrades technical analyst Pierre
Veyret. 
    As noted by our Buzz team [nL2N1WY06U], we most probably are heading into an extra-volatile
end of the year. 
    Here's how the Daily Mail expressed its feelings about a longer transition period this
morning:

    AND IT'S UP...(0744 GMT) 
    It has proven tricky to call the market earlier on this morning but it now seems safe to say
that the mood is gradually switching to 'risk-on'.
    Clearly the flurry of trading updates has something to do with investor morale changing
course to the upside. 
    Telecoms, Media, Retail and Healthcare are leading the charge with key groups from these
sectors rising following upbeat results. For our top equity stories this morning, click on

    EUROPEAN FUTURES DIP: THE OPEN NOT LOOKING SO FLAT AFTER ALL (0608 GMT) 
    With Asia slightly in the red and Wall Street futures trading in negative territory, it's
perhaps not that surprising that European futures wouldn't open in the black. 
    Looks also that the declining pound (-0.18 pct) is ready to give a gentle boost to the FTSE,
with its future up 0.1 percent.
    But overall it seems like spreadbetters expecting a slightly positive start of the session
might have been a tad optimistic:

    UK RETAIL SALES AND BREXIT DRAMA (0555 GMT) 
    Attention FTSE watchers: if the pound didn't get a proper beating from the lack of results
from the Brexit summit last night, it might come a little bit later this morning at 0830 GMT. 
    ""Pound traders will look to focus on UK retail sales data as a break from the Brexit drama,""
wrote Jasper Lawler from LCG, warning that ""this may not be a good thing"".
    Lawler believes ""there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead
of the Christmas period,"" an opinion shared by CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. 
    ""Given the decent summer it wouldn’t be unexpected to see consumers pare back their spending
once the schools go back, with expectations of a 0.4% decline."" 
    Quite possible the FTSE then gets a boost from a faltering sterling in morning trading if
retail data proves disappointing. 
    Perhaps as a sign of the sensitivity of retail data, Tuesday's figures from Kantar had quite
an impact with shares in Tesco and Sainsbury dropping on sluggish growth.

    *****
    
    
    MORNING CALL: A FLAT START? (0518 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to start the session pretty much unchanged with very little
enthusiasm coming from Asia where the MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.4 percent. 
    No breakthrough from the Brexit summit this morning and the main attention of markets seems
to be the dollar at a one week-high after the Fed minutes showed broad agreement on tightening
further. 
    The Q3 season has yet to start in earnest, but among interesting results this morning are
SAP, Thales or Carrefour. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 5 points higher, Frankfurt's DAX to
rise 6 points and Paris' CAC to edge up 2 points.

588,3834,b079325ee49d616fb77dae0bcf6a939a,Election thumping on the cards for Merkel coalition parties-poll,2018-10-18 19:15:36,EUR,-0.67366,2018-10-18 19:16:02,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's
conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) both
face a drubbing in a regional eelction on Oct. 28  that risks
further weakening their crisis-prone national government, a poll
showed on Thursday.
    The drop in support for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) 
to just 26 percent comes after their Bavarian sister party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), suffered its weakest election
performance since 1950 in a state vote on Sunday. [nL8N1WU02P]
    Poor back-to-back results for Merkel's conservative alliance
would weaken her before a CDU party conclave that is followed by
the party's annual congress in early December. If she does not
emerge well from those events, her opponents will be emboldened.
    The survey by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for
broadcaster ZDF showed support for the CDU sinking by several
points from other recent polls ahead of the Oct. 28 vote in the
western state of Hesse, home to financial centre Frankfurt.
    The poll reading of 26 percent is also far below the 38.3
percent the CDU won at the last state election in Hesse in 2013,
after which it formed a coalition with the ecologist Greens.
    The poll showed support for the SPD falling to 20 percent -
far below its result of 30.7 percent in 2013. The CDU and SPD
would also lack a majority with which to rule.
    The Greens will be the big winner in Hesse, the poll showed,
jumping into second place with 22 percent support. However,
support for the incumbent alliance of CDU and Greens was equal
to that of the other parties, so they may need a third partner.
    A so-called 'Jamaica' coalition of the CDU, Greens and FDP -
whose colours match the Jamaican national flag - would be one
option. Support for the FDP, and the far-left Linke, was at 8
percent each, the poll showed.
    Negotiations on forming a Jamaica government at the national
level collapsed earlier this year, forcing Merkel's
conservatives and the SPD to renew their ruling coalition - a
loveless alliance that had been plagued by infighting.
    After the Bavaria election debacle, Merkel vowed to restore
trust in her government. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said
""something has to change"" in the ruling coalition. [nL8N1WU02P] 
    Support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD),
which hailed the Bavaria result as ""an earthquake"" that would
rock the ruling coalition, was broadly steady in Hesse at 12
percent, the poll showed.
    Forschungsgruppe Wahlen surveyed 1,035 voters in Hesse from
Monday to Wednesday.

    By Saikat Chatterjee
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The dollar stepped back from a
one-week high on Thursday as investors took profits after a
rally this week encouraged by upbeat Fed minutes signaling more
rate hikes in store.
    A pause in the greenback's rally boosted emerging market
currencies led by the Turkish Lira <TRY=> and pushed
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
<AUD=D3> and the New Zealand dollar <NZD=D3> higher.
    The minutes from the Fed's Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every
Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates and also generally
agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, despite U.S.
President Donald Trump's view that tightening has already gone
too far. [nL2N1WX1DX]
    Goldman Sachs strategists said the minutes confirmed market
expectations of a rate increase in December. Two more are
expected next year, according to swap markets.
    ""The minutes underscore the fact that the markets are vastly
underestimating the Fed’s capacity to tighten,"" said Win Thin,
global head of FX strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in a note.
    ""At some point, we think markets will start thinking about a
fourth hike next year.""
    Risk appetite was mixed across the board with the Swiss
franc <CHF=> and the Japanese yen <JPY=> also gaining across the
board.   
    While interest rate differentials haven't played a big role
in the first half of the year in predicting currency trends as
trade war concerns have dominated sentiment, that relationship
has begun to exert its influence again in recent weeks.
    The gap between ten-year U.S. yields and German counterparts
has widened out to three-decade highs of 274 basis points and
market watchers expect the spread to widen more in the coming
months.    
    ""The minutes confirm that policymakers are expected to raise
rates more over the next year and that is helping the dollar
gain and the risk off moves last night in Asian stocks is also
another factor,"" said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist
at SEB in Stockholm.    
    Interest rate futures are now pricing in an 83 percent
likelihood that the Fed raises rates in December, according to
the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, the fourth hike this year.    
Against a basket of its rivals <=USD> <.DXY>, the dollar gained
for a third consecutive day, up 0.2 percent at 95.78.
    A semi-annual report by the U.S. Treasury report released
overnight refrained from naming China directly as a currency
manipulator though market watchers said Washington will closely
monitor the Chinese currency's moves. [nL2N1WX1WS]
    Deutsche Bank strategists termed the report ""as a bit of an
escalation without being too dramatic"".
    The Chinese currency traded in the offshore market <CNH=D3>
was trading near a three-month low against the dollar at 6.9385
yuan per dollar.
    The euro <EUR=> changed hands at $1.1519 on Thursday, up 0.2
percent versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on
Wednesday. The euro has lost less than a percent versus the
dollar so far this month.
    The British pound was flat versus the dollar on Thursday to
$1.3110 after Prime Minister Theresa May said London is willing
to discuss an extension of the transition period after Britain
leaves the European Union. [nL8N1WY1X5]

590,3838,2548caa748a42f1f6eb481f3344ca406,ANALYSIS-Lack of Italy debt contagion explodes notion of euro periphery,2018-10-18 19:19:27,EUR,0.52786,2018-10-18 19:19:38,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The striking lack of financial
contagion across the euro zone from Italy's bond-market blowout
this year shows investors are breaking an eight-year habit of
lumping together the bonds of Italy, Spain and Portugal. 
    In an apparent vindication of European Central Bank efforts
to reduce spillover across the bloc each time one of the
southern European economies gets into trouble, the market has so
far treated the Italian budget dispute as a domestic storm. 
    For years after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis, Italy,
Spain and Portugal - collectively referred to as the ""periphery""
by bond investors - saw their bonds track each other. 
    Anything that risked a repeat of the euro zone's existential
angst six years ago tarred all the weaker credits with the same
brush. 

    Yet six years after ECB chief Mario Draghi pledged to do
""whatever it takes"" to save the euro zone, the correlation is
fading. 
    An uproar over Italy's budget deficit and risks of a clash
between Rome and European Union authorities have barely touched
Portuguese and Spanish debt. Such has been the divergence that
the premium demanded by investors to hold Italian risk over
Spain's hit its widest in over 20 years.
    ""We are very close to record low levels in terms of
correlation between peripheral countries, and it's very clear
that from the market perspective for the first time in a while a
major euro zone bond market incident is not being seen as a
threat to the euro system,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, a global
strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. 
    One reason is that the budget concerns are so far confined
to Italy. But idiosyncratic risks have in the past spread across
southern European bond markets too -- one example being the
approach to the Catalan independence referendum last year.      
  
    Confidence is higher this time that the Italian debt problem
will not threaten the country's euro membership. The country's
anti-establishment coalition government has been at pains to
stress it has no interest in exiting the zone. 
    Contagion would return only if the euro's future is in
danger, said Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP
Paribas Asset Management.  
    Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JPMorgan
Asset Management, said the fund he oversees has been buying
Spanish government debt through the recent Italian ruckus. 
    ""If you're a fund manager and you don't want to own Italy,
Spain and Portugal are the only realistic alternatives,"" he told
Reuters. 
    ""Spain has been the poster child for European growth in
recent years - if you think about 2012, where unemployment rates
were, how strong concerns were over the banking system in the
periphery, we are in a very different place now,"" he said.     
    
    Spain has led the euro zone economic recovery in 2016 and
2017, growing more than 3 percent a year and earning multiple
credit ratings upgrades to Baa1 from Moody's and A- from both
S&P Global and Fitch.
    Portugal, not long ago rated junk by all three major
agencies, last week was restored to full investment-grade status
after a Moody's upgrade. Its economy grew 2.7 percent in 2017,
outperforming the euro zone [nL8N1WV2M7].
    Both countries have benefited from their share of the ECB's
2.6 trillion-euro ($3 trillion) stimulus programme.
    But even countries partly or fully outside the ECB programme
have felt its effect. Cyprus recorded stellar growth of 3.9
percent last year and Greece exited its bailout programme in
August. 
    This week, Greece said it achieved a primary budget surplus
well above target for the year so far [nL8N1WV4KI].   
     
    ""The type of investors invested in Spain and Portugal is not
the same as it was before,"" said BBVA rates trading strategist
Jaime Costero Denche. ""We have seen new investors such as
Scandinavian accounts and Middle East and Asian investors who
didn't want to buy peripheral debt in the past."" 
    A major factor limiting contagion from Italy is that
Portuguese and Spanish banks are in better shape, thanks to
authorities' success in tackling bad loans -- a road Italy
embarked on only recently.
    Portuguese banks have mostly returned to profit. In June,
Moody's lifted its outlook for Spain's banking system to
positive. It cited robust economic growth and improved asset
quality after disposals of troubled assets.

    GLOBAL SYNCHRONISED GROWTH: YOU WON'T LIKE THE SEQUEL (1156 GMT) 
    Remember how 'global synchronised growth' was the king of the buzzwords to explain the
bullishness of stock markets in 2017? 
    Well, while 2018 has seen the United States run ahead of other nations thanks to a shot in
the arm from tax cuts, 2019 could be the year when 'GSG' makes a comeback, but it might not be
that popular. 
    And that's because it will be more a case of U.S. growth slowing down rather than the rest
of the world catching up. 
    ""Global growth should continue to ease further next year and lead to a certain
resynchronization: the impact of the US fiscal boost will wane, Fed tightening should start to
have an effect and corporate investment is expected to slow, which in turn should weigh on world
trade growth,"" BNP Paribas' economic research team argues.

    SEATBELT SIGNS ON: AIRLINES EXPERIENCING TURBULENCE (1103 GMT)
    While Air France's <AIRF.PA> shares are rising strongly on hopes of a pay deal with unions,
airlines have broadly been among the worst performing this month with Flybe <FLYB.L> sinking 40
percent yesterday. Its profit warning sent peers across the sector tumbling as investors
realised rising fuel prices would likely dent airlines' profits.
    As you can see below, the MSCI Europe airlines index is down sharply this year and at an
18-month low. The sector's lost a quarter of its market value since Jan 1, and a whopping 10.9
percent in October. 
    ""Rising fuel and soft yield trends in the face of weakening capacity discipline raise
industry-specific concerns, even before we contemplate macro-economic risks, Brexit and
trade-related uncertainty,"" write HSBC analysts, who've cut estimates for their whole airline
coverage to factor in higher fuel costs. 
    With competition so intense particularly for budget short-haul airlines, the only hope is
for further M&A in the industry. 
    ""To stabilise or indeed strengthen profitability, airlines need to see capacity moderation
and consolidation,"" they write. 
    HSBC also downgrades Norwegian <NWC.OL> to reduce, sending the shares down 4.6 percent.
    ""It's a tough time for European short haul air travel and it could be another opportunity
for the big players to hoover up smaller operators and/or their routes,"" says Neil Wilson,
analyst at markets.com.

    BREXIT FATIGUE (1032 GMT) 
    Funny how last night's fruitless Brexit summit isn't seen as such a bad thing after all! 
    The pound is back to positive territory as Britain being open to extending the transition
period for leaving the EU is greeted with relief. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    A few voices however expressed some degree of despair at the prospect of longer divorce
talks. 
    ""The transition part of the interminably tedious divorce process may be more interminable -
lasting 33 months, not 21 months,"" complained Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth
Management.
    ""To force us to keep talking about this nonsense for another year seems a cruel and
unnatural punishment,"" he says while weariness about the whole issue is palpable.    
    ""Markets appear to be viewing the Brexit negotiations with the same exhaustion as everyone
else, as both sides play for time,"" is IG analyst Chris Beauchamp's take. 
    Indeed, Brexit, as a structural issue for markets, isn't going away anytime soon. 
    ""In short, we are unlikely to know for sure whether 'no deal' has been averted until much
closer to the UK's scheduled exit date in March,"" reckons ActivTrades technical analyst Pierre
Veyret. 
    As noted by our Buzz team [nL2N1WY06U], we most probably are heading into an extra-volatile
end of the year. 
    Here's how the Daily Mail expressed its feelings about a longer transition period this
morning:

    It has proven tricky to call the market earlier on this morning but it now seems safe to say
that the mood is gradually switching to 'risk-on'.
    Clearly the flurry of trading updates has something to do with investor morale changing
course to the upside. 
    Telecoms, Media, Retail and Healthcare are leading the charge with key groups from these
sectors rising following upbeat results. For our top equity stories this morning, click on

    EUROPEAN FUTURES DIP: THE OPEN NOT LOOKING SO FLAT AFTER ALL (0608 GMT) 
    With Asia slightly in the red and Wall Street futures trading in negative territory, it's
perhaps not that surprising that European futures wouldn't open in the black. 
    Looks also that the declining pound (-0.18 pct) is ready to give a gentle boost to the FTSE,
with its future up 0.1 percent.
    But overall it seems like spreadbetters expecting a slightly positive start of the session
might have been a tad optimistic:

    UK RETAIL SALES AND BREXIT DRAMA (0555 GMT) 
    Attention FTSE watchers: if the pound didn't get a proper beating from the lack of results
from the Brexit summit last night, it might come a little bit later this morning at 0830 GMT. 
    ""Pound traders will look to focus on UK retail sales data as a break from the Brexit drama,""
wrote Jasper Lawler from LCG, warning that ""this may not be a good thing"".
    Lawler believes ""there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead
of the Christmas period,"" an opinion shared by CMC Markets' Michael Hewson. 
    ""Given the decent summer it wouldn’t be unexpected to see consumers pare back their spending
once the schools go back, with expectations of a 0.4% decline."" 
    Quite possible the FTSE then gets a boost from a faltering sterling in morning trading if
retail data proves disappointing. 
    Perhaps as a sign of the sensitivity of retail data, Tuesday's figures from Kantar had quite
an impact with shares in Tesco and Sainsbury dropping on sluggish growth.

    MORNING CALL: A FLAT START? (0518 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to start the session pretty much unchanged with very little
enthusiasm coming from Asia where the MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.4 percent. 
    No breakthrough from the Brexit summit this morning and the main attention of markets seems
to be the dollar at a one week-high after the Fed minutes showed broad agreement on tightening
further. 
    The Q3 season has yet to start in earnest, but among interesting results this morning are
SAP, Thales or Carrefour. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 5 points higher, Frankfurt's DAX to
rise 6 points and Paris' CAC to edge up 2 points.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's prime minister on
Thursday denied any division between the two parties in his
governing coalition, after reports of a spat over tax revenues,
and insisted Rome will move ahead with planned expansionary
budgetary measures.
    His remarks came as European Union leaders raised concerns
about Rome's extravagant budgetary plans that could further
increase Italy's public debt ratio, which at 133 percent of
gross domestic product is the highest in the EU after Greece.
    In what could be a further source of concern, Deputy Prime
Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star party, said on
Wednesday a legislative text on a partial tax amnesty had been
""manipulated"" before its final approval.
    The anti-establishment 5-Star has always opposed amnesties -
a frequently used policy in Italy where people or companies can
avoid being pursued for tax dodging by paying a fee. Its
coalition partner, the far-right League, favours amnesties,
which bring money into the treasury and are popular with voters.
    Di Maio did not clarify who could have amended the document.
    Asked by reporters about a possible coalition rift, Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte - who is not from any political party -
replied: ""There is no division"".
    Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, Conte acknowledged
that budget plans to boost welfare spending, cut the retirement
age and hike the deficit were unlikely to please the European
Commission, which polices euro zone states' fiscal policies.
    The Commission says the budget is likely to breach EU fiscal
rules and increase debt.
    ""I'm aware this is not the budget the Commission expected. I
expect critical observations. We will discuss and we will reply
to these considerations,"" Conte told reporters.
    On Wednesday Conte said he saw no room for changing tack and
on Thursday described the budget as ""beautiful"".
    At the summit, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said
fiscal rules should be respected by all, adding: ""Too much debt
is dangerous.""
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at a meeting with Conte on
Wednesday, called for ""positive dialogue"" between Italy and the
EU on the budget [nL8N1WX6VL].    
    Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Twitter he had
expressed concerns over Italy's budget plans in a meeting with
Conte on Thursday. He added that the Commission had Netherlands'
full support in making sure EU fiscal rules are respected.
    In its review of Rome's budgetary plans, the EU Commission
can raise concerns until Monday. It could then decide to send
the budget back for changes by Oct. 29, in what would be an
unprecedented move that is likely to cause further market
turmoil [nL8N1WV23B]. 
    Yields on Italian benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after
elections in March [IT527480=].

new proposals to address cross-border issues in swaps trading
rules. One goal is increased global regulatory coordination that
includes more recognition of overseas measures as equivalent to
U.S. rules.

reforms passed by the U.S. Congress in Title VII of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010 and the commitments made by the G20 leaders in Pittsburgh

596,3904,839276b6c34d7e5e68581a221f146f21,Lion Capital sells Dutch retailer HEMA to Dutch billionaire,2018-10-18 22:16:44,EUR,0.0,2018-10-18 22:17:14,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    AMSTERDAM, Oct 18 (Reuters) - HEMA, one of the Netherlands'
largest retail chains, said on Thursday it will be bought for an
undisclosed sum by investment firm Ramphastos Investments, owned
by Dutch billionaire Marcel Boekhoorn.
    HEMA, bought by London-based Lion Capital in 2007, operates
more than 700 stores in nine countries, selling over 30,000 own
brand products ranging from baby clothing to stationery, food
and gardening tools. 
    ""With its new owner, HEMA can focus fully in the next few
years on online growth, international expansion and improving
profitability"", the company said in a statement.
    Lion Capital started looking for a buyer for HEMA over a
year ago, after an earlier effort to offload the retailer failed
in 2010. 
    HEMA has been struggling to compete with discounters and
online shops for years. Although its sales rose 3.5 percent last
year to 1.24 billion euros ($1.43 billion), its net loss
increased to 31 million euros, while gross debt ran up to 753
million.    
    Dutch media reported in June that Belgian investor Core
Equity had dropped a bid of 1 billion euros, including debt, as
it disagreed with store franchise operators over how to split
revenue from the company's online store. [nL5N1T8217]
    HEMA opened its first store in Amsterdam in 1926 and has
since branched out across Europe. Earlier this year it opened
its first store outside the continent, in the United Arab
Emirates, but it still generates roughly three quarters of its
revenues in the Netherlands.

    By Philip Pullella
    VATICAN CITY, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday
received an invitation to visit North Korea and the pontiff
indicated that he would consider making what would be a landmark
trip to the hermit nation, according to South Korean officials.
   South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed the invitation
from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the pope verbally during
a 35-minute meeting in the Vatican.
    Any visit would be the first by a pope to the reclusive
state which does not allow priests to be permanently stationed
there. There is little information on how many of its citizens
are Catholic, or how they practice their faith.
    Kim told Moon, a Catholic, of his wish to meet the pontiff
during a meeting last month and the South Korean leader
announced before the trip that he would be relaying a message.
[nL4N1WP2AI].
    According to the president's office, Francis expressed his
strong support for efforts to bring peace to the Korean
peninsula. Moon's office quoted the pope as telling Moon: ""Do
not stop, move forward. Do not be afraid.""
    Asked if Kim should send a formal invitation, Moon's office
quoted the pope as responding to Moon: ""your message is already
sufficient but it would be good for him to send a formal
invitation.""
    ""I will definitely answer if I get the invitation, and I can
go,"" the president's office quoted the pope as saying.
    
    RECONCILIATION
    The pope is expected to be in Asia during a trip to Japan
next year.
    A Vatican statement made no mention of the verbal invitation
from Kim.
    It spoke only of ""the promotion of dialogue and
reconciliation between Koreans"" and ""the common commitment to
fostering all useful initiatives to overcome the tensions that
still exist in the Korean Peninsula, in order to usher in a new
season of peace and development.""
    The two Koreas have held three summits this year. Kim also
held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in
Singapore in June, and promised to work toward denuclearisation
of the Korean peninsula.
    Any trip to the North, however brief, could be contentious
for the pope.
    North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion as
long as it does not undermine the state. But beyond a handful of
state-controlled places of worship, no open religious activity
is allowed.
    Aides close to the pope have said he is open to taking what
they call first steps in places where the Church has been
persecuted in the hope that the situation could improve.
    Church officials estimate that North Korea had a Catholic
community of about 55,000 just before the 1950-53 Korean War.
    Religious agencies have estimated the number remaining from
the few hundreds to about 4,000.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's Prime Minister defended
the country's ""beautiful"" 2019 budget on Thursday, saying he had
expected Brussels to criticise it as European authorities
stepped up pressure for changes to a draft that breaches the
bloc's fiscal rules.
    Giuseppe Conte also denied a rift over the fiscal plan
within his governing coalition, after reports of a spat over tax
revenues.
    The draft, signed off by Italy's cabinet on Monday, will
hike the deficit at a time when under EU regulations it should
be narrowing, as well as boosting welfare spending and cutting
the retirement age.
    In the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to
Brussels rejecting the budget and to fines against Italy, an EU
official told Reuters the European Commission was expected to
deliver a warning letter to Rome on Thursday. [nB5N1VQ00D]
    ""I'm aware this is not the budget the Commission expected. I
expect critical observations. We will discuss and we will reply
to these considerations,"" Conte told journalists on the second
day of a two-day EU summit, prior to reports of the new EU
letter.
    He described the budget as ""beautiful"", having said on
Wednesday that he saw no room for changing tack on it.
    The letter will be handed by Economics Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici to Italy's Finance Minister Giovanni Tria in a meeting
in Rome, the EU official said.
    If it is not amended, the Commission could reject the draft
by Oct. 29 in what would be an unprecedented move that could
further rattle markets. [nL8N1WV23B]. 
    Yields on Italian benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after
elections in March that gave eurosceptic parties a large boost
[IT527480=], rising further as the outline of an ambitious
fiscal plan that could further boost Italy's public debt ratio -
proportionally already the second highest in the EU after Greece
- became clear.
    
    COALITION SPAT?
    EU leaders also warned Italy about the budget at the summit.
    Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said fiscal rules should
be respected by all, adding: ""Too much debt is dangerous.""
    Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Twitter he had
expressed concerns over the budget plans in a meeting with Conte
on Thursday. He added that the Commission had Netherlands' full
support in making sure EU fiscal rules were respected.
    In what could be a source of concern at home, Deputy Prime
Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star party, said on
Wednesday a legislative text on a partial tax amnesty had been
""manipulated"" before its final approval, raising doubts about
the stability of Italy's coalition government and about the
revenues for its budget.
    The anti-establishment 5-Star has always opposed amnesties -
a frequently used policy in Italy where people or companies can
avoid being pursued for tax dodging by paying a fee. Its
coalition partner, the far-right League, favours amnesties,
which bring money into the treasury and are popular with voters.
    Di Maio did not clarify who could have amended the document.
    Asked by reporters about a possible coalition rift, Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte - who is not from any political party -
replied: ""There is no division"". He added he would work on the
legislative text after returning to Rome on Friday.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The status of the British
overseas territory of Gibraltar, a small isthmus on Spain's
southern coast, after Britain leaves the European Union has been
agreed with Britain, Spain's prime minister said on Thursday.
    Gibraltar will leave the EU along with the United Kingdom on

sovereign areas in EU member Cyprus, forms part of any overall
divorce agreement with the EU.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Europe's antitrust chief
Margrethe Vestager has asked Italy if Alitalia pays interest on
a 900-million-euro ($1 billion) loan granted to the carrier last
year to keep it afloat while it looks for a buyer.
    Loss-making Alitalia was put under special administration
last year and since then Rome has been on the hunt for a buyer.
The new populist government wants to keep Alitalia in public
hands.
    The European Commission opened an investigation into the
case in April to check whether the loan complies with the bloc's
state aid rules against giving companies an unfair advantage.
    Responding to a query from a lawmaker at the European
Parliament, Vestager said she was seeking more information on
the case.
    ""The Italian authorities have been asked to provide
clarifications about several issues, including whether interest
has been paid to the state on the 900 million euro loan,"" she
said in a written reply.
    ""Where the state is a creditor and it waives or fails to
claim the interest owed to it on a loan, this could involve
state aid in so far as that behaviour is not that of a diligent
market economy creditor,"" Vestager said.
    The Italian Treasury was not available for comment while
Alitalia declined to comment. Alitalia would have to repay the
loan if this is found to be illegal state aid.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The status of the British

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed
on Thursday to impose sanctions to stiffen their response to
cyber attacks and to rush through new curbs on online
campaigning by political parties to protect next year's European
polls from interference.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel became the latest leader
this week to warn against the risk of disinformation and voter
manipulation to undermine the May elections to the European
legislature.
    The threat of a special EU economic sanctions regime against
computer hackers, including hostile governments and individuals,
as well as fines for political parties, will act as a deterrent,
European Council President Donald Tusk said after a summit of EU
leaders.
    ""Such a regime should help to protect our citizens,
companies and institutions from all kinds of cyber security
threats,"" Tusk told reporters, referring to proposals pushed by
seven EU countries including Britain.
    Russia has made cyber and electronic warfare part of its
military operations, Western officials say, and Britain, the
Netherlands and the United States have accused Moscow of
conducting a global campaign of computer hacks against the West.
[nL8N1WK35D]
    But EU officials are equally concerned about the misuse of
voter data by domestic actors to sway elections.
    The EU executive proposed new rules last month to guard
against a repeat of the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal.
[nL5N1VX5Y1]
    The data of millions of EU citizens were among those used by
the British political consultancy to build profiles on voters
and influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. 
    In summit conclusions on Thursday, EU leaders said the new
measures to tackle cybersecurity, disinformation and data
manipulation ""deserve rapid examination and operational
follow-up"".
    In their meeting with Asian leaders at the EU-Asia summit
from Thursday evening, the 28 EU leaders will meet Russian Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev and China's Premier Li Keqiang. Cyber
security is expected to be discussed, with a final statement
focusing on action to combat hackers.
    Russia and China deny responsibility for cyber attacks.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The gap between Italian and
German 10-year bond yield spreads hit its widest level in 5-1/2
years after Brussels stepped up pressure on the government in
Rome to rein in its budget ambitions.
    EU authorities said they would send a formal warning letter
over fiscal rule breaches in the 2019 draft - the first stage of
a procedure that could lead to Brussels rejecting the budget and
to fines against Italy. [8N1WY4UV] 
    Concerns over Rome's expansive budget plans have weighed
heavily on Italian government bonds in recent weeks, and on
Thursday yields rose sharply across the curve, with the two-year
bond yield up 22 bps in late trade at 1.855 percent. 
    Italy's five-year yield rose 19 basis points to a five-year
high at 3.15 percent, while its 10-year yield rose 13 bps to a
one-week high of 3.663 percent. <IT5YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR> 
    The closely-watched Italy/Germany spread hit 324 basis
points, the widest level since April 2013. <DE10IT10=RR> 
    ""I think the market is anticipating some tough debate
between the EU and Italy, especially if they are starting this
process that could lead to a budget rejection,"" said Natixis
rates strategist Cyril Regnat. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte defended what he
called Italy's ""beautiful"" budget and said the EU letter was
""not a cause for concern."" [nR1N14501A]
    Conte presented his budget to EU leaders in Brussels but it
was not discussed in any detail, the head of the European
Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said. [nL2N1WY0W4]
    Amid the budget noise, Italy bought back 3.8 billion euros
of government bonds maturing 2020, in conjunction with a new
issue of five-year bonds. 
    Spain's bonds also came under pressure with its 10-year
yield rising eight basis points to a one-year high of 1.74
percent.
    But the risky backdrop in Europe meant that 10-year German
bond yields dropped to 0.402 percent, the lowest in two weeks.
<DE10YT=RR> 
    Two-year U.S. Treasury bond yields <US2YT=RR> rose to their
highest since 2008, meanwhile, with minutes released on
Wednesday showing the U.S. Federal Reserve is largely united on
the need to raise borrowing costs further.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union rejected U.S.
calls to water down new  derivatives clearing rules on Thursday,
saying EU lawmakers would not be ""blackmailed"" and it had every
right to supervise foreign financial firms in the same way as
U.S. regulators.
    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair
Christopher Giancarlo threatened retaliation on Wednesday unless
the EU softened the draft rules, which set out tougher
conditions for foreign clearing houses doing business in the
bloc. [nL8N1WX2II]
    They include allowing EU regulators to directly supervise
clearing houses on their home turf in some instances.
    For two regulators to air their differences so publicly is
rare.
    Asked if the bloc would weaken the rules, EU financial
services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said they were similar to how
the United States supervises foreign financial firms that serve
U.S. customers.
    ""Our system would become more similar to the U.S. system.
It's a balanced approach,"" Dombrovskis said.
    The EU was not calling into question its existing agreement
with the United States on recognising each other's derivatives
clearing rules, he said.
    Dombrovskis' top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, told the
Politico event that it was unfortunate that ""my friend Mr
Giancarlo is blackmailing legislators"".
    When the United States threatened to cut off U.S. market
access for EU financial firms, it would change nothing. ""I don't
like it but that is their right,"" Guersent said.
    The EU rules were drawn up in response to Brexit, which will
result in Europe's biggest clearing house for euro-denominated
transactions like interest rate swaps, London-based LCH <LSE.L>,
being located outside the bloc.
    Unless the Bank of England agrees to joint supervision of
LCH, the clearer may have to shift euro-denominated operations
to the EU or risk losing the business.
    The draft rules have led to accusations of regulatory
overreach in the United States, home to clearers like CME
<CME.O> and ICE <ICE.N>.
    Giancarlo said that unless the EU rules were watered down so
that the bloc's regulators ""defer"" to U.S. counterparts when it
comes to supervising American clearing houses, the CFTC could
effectively bar U.S. securities houses from trading on EU
exchanges. 
    Latest figures from the EU's securities watchdog ESMA on the
bloc's 660 trillion euro derivatives market, published on
Thursday, highlighted London's dominance in heavily traded
products like interest rate swaps.   
    The European Commission said it offers greater deference to
the CFTC than vice versa.
    ""The objective of the proposed new framework of CCP
supervision is to ...adapt our supervisory framework to the
evolving circumstances in European derivatives markets,"" a
Commission spokesman said. 
    ""We look forward to continuing the dialogue on this matter.""

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A report on risks to the
stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff if
Britain leaves the EU with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be published in coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks and the BoE have called on Brussels to take preventive
action to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives
contracts if there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern, but the private sector could
take action to mitigate risks, such as shifting contracts from
London to the EU before March.
    Once the interim report is published, ""we can see what
concrete steps are necessary, whether there are also some
regulatory steps that are necessary,"" Dombrovskis said.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Asked about concerns over derivatives in a no-deal Brexit,
Dombrovskis' top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, said: ""There
is no cliff.""
    ""On 30th of March... nothing happens,"" Guersent said, adding
that contracts would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
    But banks say Brussels is slow to deal with potential
contract disruption in order to pile pressure on them to staff
new hubs in the EU before March and shift the contracts to them.
    Mark Hoban, head of the IRSG, a financial services think
tank backed by the financial sector, said the sector was waiting
for regulators in Britain and the EU to sign cooperation
agreements to deal with potential disruption to contracts.
    ""My suspicion is that you have got MOUs stuck in desk
drawers on both sides of the Channel. What the regulators are
waiting for is the green light from the Commission that allows
conversations to happen.""
    Giving the green light would give markets more confidence
about Brexit Day, but instead there is unhelpful brinkmanship,
Hoban said.

    By April Joyner
    NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell more than 1
percent on Thursday as the European Commission issued a warning
regarding Italy's budget and concerns mounted over the
possibility of strained relations between the United States and
Saudi Arabia, further denting investors' appetite for risk amid
global trade tensions and rising interest rates.
    The benchmark S&P 500 index <.SPX> closed just above its
200-day moving average, a key indicator of long-term price
trends.
    S&P 500 technology <.SPLRCT> and consumer discretionary
<.SPLRCD> stocks fell more than 2 percent, as did the tech-heavy
Nasdaq <.IXIC>. Among the S&P's major sectors, only utilities
<.SPLRCU> and real estate <.SPLRCR>, considered defensive,
avoided losses.
    Wall Street's major indexes pared early losses in morning
trading but reversed course to fall further as European markets
closed. Italian bond yields jumped after the European Commission
deemed the country's 2019 budget draft to be in breach of EU
rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    U.S. stocks declined further after U.S. Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin pulled out of an investor conference in Saudi
Arabia as the White House awaited the outcome of investigations
into the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
[nL8N1WY0MJ]
    Mnuchin's decision sparked worries of potential strain in
U.S.-Saudi relations, especially if Saudi leaders were found to
have been involved in Khashoggi's disappearance. Investors
raised concern that if Saudi Arabia were sanctioned, it could
restrict oil supply and prompt a rise in energy prices.
    ""As soon as the news came out it increased the selling,""
said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone
Wealth LLC in New York. ""Anything that has a semblance of
the possibility of trouble, people in this environment see it as
a much larger problem than it may really be.""
    U.S. stocks had opened lower as Chinese stocks fell
overnight, sparking fresh worries about the impact of trade
tensions on China's economy.
    Concerns over rising interest rates following Wednesday's
release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from its
September meeting also pressured Wall Street's major indexes.
    ""It's the usual suspects, namely the trade war and rising
rates,"" said Brendan Erne, director of portfolio implementation
at Personal Capital in San Francisco. ""They're still a double
whammy.""
    Both those factors were reflected in weak earnings reports
from Cessna business jet maker Textron Inc <TXT.N> and equipment
rental company United Rentals Inc <URI.N>.
    Textron shares fell 11.3 percent and United Rentals shares
sank 15.0 percent, while Sealed Air Corp shares <SEE.N> slid 8.3
percent after the packaging company cut its full-year profit
outlook due to higher raw material and freight costs.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 327.23 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 25,379.45, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 40.43
points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,768.78 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> dropped 157.56 points, or 2.1 percent, to 7,485.14.
    Among the few bright spots was Philip Morris International
Inc <PM.N>, whose shares rose 3.5 percent after the Marlboro
cigarette maker topped analysts' estimates for quarterly profit
and sales. [nL8N1WY3WA]
    Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a
3.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
    The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 36 new lows;
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 128 new lows. 
    Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.79 billion shares, compared
to the 7.95 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

conference)
    By Jeff Mason and Bulent Usta
    WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL, Oct 18 (Reuters) - President Donald
Trump said on Thursday he presumes journalist Jamal Khashoggi is
dead and that the U.S. response to Saudi Arabia will likely be
""very severe"" but that he still wanted to get to the bottom of
what exactly happened.
    In Istanbul, Turkish investigators for a second time
searched the Saudi consulate where Khashoggi - a U.S. resident
and Washington Post columnist who was a strong critic of Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman - vanished on Oct. 2, seeking clues
about an incident that has caused an international outcry.
    Trump acknowledged for the first time that Khashoggi had
likely been killed.
    ""It certainly looks that way to me. It's very sad,"" Trump
told reporters before boarding Air Force One on a political
trip.
    Trump spoke hours after getting an update from Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo on the results of Pompeo's emergency talks in
Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
    Pompeo told reporters after his meeting that he advised
Trump that Saudi Arabia should be given a few more days to
complete its investigation into the Khashoggi disappearance.
Turkish officials have said they believe the Saudi journalist
was murdered at the consulate and his body chopped up and
removed.
    Trump said he was waiting for the results so that ""we can
get to the bottom of this very soon"" and that he would be making
a statement about it at some point.
    Asked what would be the consequences for Saudi Arabia, Trump
said: ""Well, it'll have to be very severe. I mean, it's bad, bad
stuff. But we'll see what happens.""
    Saudi Arabia has denied involvement in the disappearance.
    The United States considers Riyadh a linchpin in efforts to
contain Iran's regional influence and a key global oil source,
and Trump has shown no inclination to mete out harsh punishment
to the Saudis.
    Referring to the Saudis, Pompeo said he told Trump ""we ought
to give them a few more days to complete"" their investigation in
order to get a full understanding of what happened, ""at which
point we can make decisions about how - or if - the United
States should respond to the incident surrounding Mr.
Khashoggi.""
    By casting doubt on whether the United States will respond
at all, Pompeo reflected the internal struggle among Trump and
his national security advisers on what to do should the Saudi
leadership be blamed for what happened to Khashoggi.
    ""I think it's important for us all to remember, too - we
have a long, since 1932, a long strategic relationship with the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" Pompeo told reporters after meeting
with Trump, also calling Saudi Arabia ""an important
counterterrorism partner.""
    In addition, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
abandoned plans to attend an investor conference in Riyadh,
putting the high-profile event in question.
    Mnuchin became the latest Western official to pull out of
the investment conference in Riyadh scheduled for Oct. 23-25,
joining a list of international officials and business
executives. Earlier on Thursday, senior government ministers
from France, Britain and the Netherlands withdrew, too.
    As of Thursday, the conference was still going on. The
spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which is
hosting the event, was not immediately available for comment.
The organizers could not be reached for comment.

    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's
conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) both
face a drubbing in a regional election on Oct. 28 that risks
further weakening their crisis-plagued national government,
polls showed on Thursday.
    The drop in support for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) 
comes after their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union (CSU), suffered its worst performance since 1950 in a
state vote on Sunday. [nL8N1WU02P]
    Poor back-to-back results for Merkel's conservative alliance
would undermining her standing going into a CDU party conclave
followed by the party's annual congress in early December. If
she does not emerge well from those events, her opponents will
be emboldened.
    A regional poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for broadcaster
ZDF showed support for the CDU at 26 percent ahead of the Oct.
28 vote in the western state of Hesse, home to financial centre
Frankfurt. The CDU won 38.3 percent at the last state election
there in 2013.
    A national poll by DeutschlandTrend had both the CDU and the
SPD at their lowest levels since the survey launched in 1997, at
25 percent and 14 percent, respectively.
    The regional poll suggested the Greens will be the big
winner in Hesse, jumping into second place. However, support for
the incumbent alliance of CDU and Greens was equal to that of
the other parties, so they may need a third partner.
    A so-called 'Jamaica' coalition of the CDU, Greens and FDP -
whose colours match the Jamaican national flag - would be one
option. Support for the FDP, and the far-left Linke, was at 8
percent each, the poll showed.
    Negotiations on forming a Jamaica government at the national
level collapsed this year, forcing Merkel's conservatives and
the SPD to renew their governing coalition, a loveless alliance
that had been plagued by infighting.
    After the Bavaria election debacle, Merkel promised to
restore trust in her government. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said
""something has to change"" in the ruling coalition. [nL8N1WU02P] 
    Support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD),
which hailed the Bavaria result as ""an earthquake"" that would
rock the ruling coalition, was broadly steady in Hesse at 12
percent, the poll showed.
    Forschungsgruppe Wahlen surveyed 1,035 voters in Hesse from
Monday to Wednesday.

    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

the European Union warned of rules breaches in Italy's draft

    Italy's Prime Minister defended its free-spending budget on

unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules.[nL8N1WY213]

    By Andrew Galbraith
    SHANGHAI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks clawed back losses
on Friday as China's efforts to bolster investor confidence
helped its share markets rally, although data showing the
world's second-largest economy growing at the slowest pace since
2009 capped broader gains.
    The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside
Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was up 0.3 percent after earlier falling
as much as 0.9 percent ahead of the release of China's latest
GDP reading.
    Spreadbetters in Europe expect shares in Germany, where big
exporters are sensitive to the health of China's economy, to
fall at the open, with the DAX <.GDAXI> seen opening down 0.15
percent. France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> is expected to open 0.04
percent lower, but the FTSE 100 <.FTSE> is seen rising 0.24
percent.
    Australian shares <.AXJO> fell 0.05 percent and Japan's
Nikkei average <.N225> ended 0.6 percent lower for its third
straight week of declines.
    China shares see-sawed but were up firmly in early afternoon
trade following statements of government support for the market.
The Shanghai index <.SSEC>, which in the morning fell to its
weakest level in four years, turned around to gain 2.3 percent
around 0620 GMT. The blue-chip index <.CSI300> surged 2.7
percent.
    The rebound in China followed weakness on Wall Street on
Thursday, which had earlier set the tone for many Asian markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 1.27 percent, the
S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 1.44 percent and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> dropped 2.06 percent.
    As the Asian day wore on, investors in China shrugged off
data showing that China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third
quarter, its weakest pace since 2009 and below expectations, as
a campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the
United States weighed on the economy. [nL4N1WQ2N8]
    ""Weakness is largely coming from the secondary industry-
most notably manufacturing,"" said Betty Wang, senior China
economist at ANZ. ""We may review our Q4 forecasts. Property
investment continues to hold up which may provide some support.""
    
    GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
    Shares in China had initially sputtered at the open of
trade, then firmed as investors digested statements from senior
regulators pledging support for private firms and companies
facing liquidity problems. [nL3N1WZ1AA]
    China's banking and insurance regulator also said on Friday
that it may allow bank wealth management subsidiaries to invest
directly in stocks. [nB9N1VJ002]
    Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC
Nikko Securities in Tokyo, said that downward pressure on
Chinese growth in part reflected the impact of Beijing's
long-running deleveraging campaign.
    ""The government has been aware of the negative impact from
deleveraging and has swung towards easing around June, but the
positive impact is yet to be felt,"" he said. ""There should be
enough funding and if the funds trickle down to public works, we
could expect to see positive impact in the next quarter.""
    But analysts cautioned that China's economy would continue
to face difficulties.
    ""Looking ahead, economic outlook is not optimistic with
exports facing further headwinds as U.S. tariffs kick in and
demand from emerging countries ebbs,"" said Nie Wen, an analyst
at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
    China's premier said this week that the economy faces
increased downward pressure, but that government will take
measures to stabilise growth amid the trade war. [nL3N1WX61B]
    In the latest trade war volley, the U.S. has requested that
a World Trade Organization dispute resolution panel look into
tariffs imposed by China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico
in retaliation to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.
[nL8N1WY6NU]
    Further fraying market nerves, the European Commission on
Thursday said a draft 2019 budget from Italy was in
""particularly serious non-compliance"" with EU rules, setting the
stage for a possible unprecedented rejection of the country's
fiscal plan. [nL8N1WY213]
    On Thursday, the flight to safe-haven assets partly dampened
rising U.S. Treasury yields. On Friday, however, the 10-year
yield <US10YT=RR> rose to 3.1826 percent from the U.S. close on
Thursday of 3.175 percent.
    The two-year yield <US2YT=RR>, sensitive to expectations of
higher Fed fund rates, rose to 2.8871 percent.
    The euro <EUR=> was up 0.1 percent at $1.1464, while the
dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback against a basket
of six major rivals, was a touch higher at 95.925.
    The dollar was up 0.23 percent against the yen at 112.44
<JPY=>.
    Oil prices ticked higher after falling on Thursday. U.S.
crude <CLc1> was up 0.4 percent at $68.92 a barrel and Brent
crude <LCOc1> was trading at $79.61 per barrel, also 0.4 percent
higher. 
    Spot gold <XAU=> gained 0.3 percent to $1,228.60 per ounce.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    EARLY MORNING HEADLINE ROUND-UP: CHINA, CONSTRUCTION, AUTOS IN FOCUS (0546 GMT)
    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - European leaders wind down their
talks in Brussels today by meeting their Asian counterparts in
an EU-Asia summit intended to show multilateral cooperation
still lives on in the Trump era. Everything from trade to
climate change will be on the agenda, as will the signing of a
much-delayed EU-Singapore trade pact. On the Brexit stand-off,
the EU is for now choosing to wax optimistic about the chances
of a deal while making clear that it is now entirely up to
Theresa May to bring her government round to the compromise
close to being clinched last weekend.
    May's finance minister Philip Hammond will meanwhile be
hoping that public finance figures for September due for release
today contain no nasty surprises ahead of his Oct. 30 budget,
where he is under pressure to deliver spending hikes in areas
such as health. August's deficit came in well above expectations
on a combination of subdued tax receipts, a rise in the state
pension and higher EU budget payments. Voter support for higher
spending on Britain's battered public services is rising:
Hammond's boss May believes the government must respond to
ensure opposition Labour do not capitalise.
    Poland holds local elections on Sunday that will be an
interesting midterm test of the popularity of the Law and
Justice (PiS) party and its mix of social conservatism,
nationalism and voter-pleasing welfare benefit policies. Much of
the focus will be on the capital Warsaw and whether the PiS
candidate can beat the centrist favourite in what has long been
a stronghold for the rival Civic Platform (PO). That would be a
major upset suggesting that PiS' brand of populism works with
urban voters too.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    Another day, another dollop of bad news. After sharp drops
last night on Wall Street and a fresh blowout in Italian bond
yields, this morning has been dominated by data showing China's
Q3 economic growth was the weakest since 2009, dragged down by
weak industrial output including a 10 percent fall in car output
in September. But pledges of support from regulators and PBOC
governor Yi Gang have stabilised local equity markets, and in
fact Shanghai and Shenzen have jumped almost 3 percent though
they are down around 30 percent this year. But the prospect of
stimulus is likely to pressure the yuan further; offshore yuan
touched two-month lows yesterday. And the data dampened the mood
right across Asia with Japan, Australia and Korean stocks all
taking a hit before tracking the Chinese markets.
    In Europe, shares are set to open marginally lower, with the
China-exposed DAX likely to see the most pain. All that is just
convincing more people that the stock market bull is being kept
alive merely with the glucose injections provided by US tax
cuts. That is expected to allow for 20 percent plus earnings
growth in the US this quarter. However, there was already some
disappointment last night from industrials, while tech stocks
fell 2 percent. Later today we have earnings from Honeywell as
well as State Street and Proctor and Gamble, the latter showing
how consumer goods demand is holding up in the developing world
too. 
     World stocks are set for their fourth straight week of
losses, their longest losing streak since 2015, though the
S&P500 will likely snap a three-week losing streak. While all
the nerves have dampened yields of safe Bunds and Treasuries,
there could be fresh concerns about Europe where the European
Commission called Italy’s 2019 budget ""particularly serious
non-compliance"" with EU rules, setting the stage for an
unprecedented rejection of the country's fiscal plan. Italian
yields this morning are up 5 bps after they spiked yesterday to
5-1/2 year highs, and this morning, money markets have cut back
expectations of an ECB rate rise in September 2019, and are now
fully pricing a rate rise only in October. Clearly, markets are
expecting the Italy woes to impact the ECB decision.
    On currency markets, eyes are likely to be on the yuan which
is fast heading towards the 7 per dollar mark. The euro too is
likely to come under pressure from the Italy issues, having hit
a 10-day low versus the dollar on Thursday. But emerging
currencies are set for their second straight week of gains
according to an MSCI index. Sterling is a touch higher after the
EU’s Barnier said a deal was 90 percent done - even though he
added that the Irish border issue could still derail it. 
    European stocks opened slightly lower after a sharp fall on
Thursday as Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are
bad news for Germany’s stock market which is the most reliant on
the world’s second largest economy. DAX is just in the red.
Rhetoric between European Commission and Italian government
ramps up over the budget. Some recurring themes were emerging
from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in China,
issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing
regulations weighing on autos. Tyre maker Michelin blamed
slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth
forecasts for tyre demand. The stock was indicated down 5 to 7
percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to
“difficulties” in its construction businesses, and traders saw
the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. Sweden’s Volvo was the
outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly
profit expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and
construction equipment and forecasting high demand in its main
markets of Europe and North America in 2019. M&A could also be a
driver for UK retail property developer Intu which confirmed on
Friday it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium
formed by British billionaire John Whittaker and Saudi Arabian
and Canadian investors. One trading desk saw the shares rising 8
percent.

 (Adds details, updates prices)
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The pound briefly rose on Friday
after European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit
deal with the United Kingdom was 90 percent done, although
political uncertainty in Britain kept the gains in check.
    More positive noises out of Brussels about reaching a Brexit
trade deal - the dominant driver of sterling - have been offset
by growing unhappiness within Prime Minister Theresa May's own
party and her rivals about the sort of Brexit agreement she
wants to forge.
    ""A domestic political storm may well be about to hit London.
The latest move to extend the transition period beyond December
2020 looks to have really destabilised the domestic political
landscape,"" said MUFG analysts in a note.
    ""A break below $1.3000 in GBP/USD looks inevitable now, and
of course this scenario reinforces EUR/USD downside risks as
well.""       
    Sterling rose to a day's high versus the dollar of $1.3038
<GBP=D3> after Barnier's comments, but it later gave up those
gains and to trade down slightly at $1.3013, its weakest since
Oct 5. 
    It strengthened 0.2 percent against the euro to 87.86 pence
<EURGBP=D3>. 
    ""Ninety percent of the accord on the table has been agreed
with Britain,"" Barnier told France Inter radio, adding that the
Irish border issue remained a sticking point and could derail
any agreement. [nP6N1WB00B]
    Britain's foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Friday it
would be hard to resolve the issue of a backstop to the Irish
border problem in Brexit talks without more detail on the future
relationship with the EU after Brexit. [nL9N1SI02M]

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - While European
heavyweights like Thyssenkrupp and Siemens restructure, the $45
bln Swiss-Swedish group still sits on a largely unrelated power
business. Now CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer is finally mulling action,
he should opt for a full spinoff rather than a half-hearted
partial sale.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - ABB is exploring a sale of its power grids business,
Reuters reported on Oct. 18 citing people familiar with the
matter. 
    - ABB is examining various options for its second-largest
but lowest-margin business, Reuters reported citing three
sources. A decision is likely by early next year. 
    - ""A sale of a majority is the preferred option at moment,
although selling a minority or spinning it off are also
possible,” one source told Reuters.
    - Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer two years ago said he
would keep the unit that sells power-plant equipment and
services to utility companies, defying activist shareholder
Cevian Capital.
    - Credit Suisse and investment banking boutique Dyal Co. are
advising ABB on a deal for the unit that generated $10.4 billion
in revenue last year.
    - ABB’s Zurich-listed shares closed at 21.16 euros on Oct.
18 and are down 19 percent so far this year.

    By Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Investors sold Italian bonds and
the euro on Friday, with Italy's bond yield hitting four-year
highs as the European Union called its draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules.
    Late on Thursday, the European Commission told Rome in a
letter https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/18_10_18_commission_letter_to_italy_en_0_1.pdf
 that planned government spending was too high and that its
structural deficit would rise instead of fall, and that the
country's public debt would not fall in line with EU rules.
[nL8N1WY6JF]
    Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte defended the budget.
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the
month. [nL8N1WY4UV]
    While it isn't unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of their budget plans, the sending
of a formal letter and the tone of the comments were
particularly strong, analysts said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid said in a note to clients. 
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent
in early trade on Friday, the highest since February 2014.
<IT10YT=RR>
    The closely watched Italian/German bond yield spread hit a
fresh 5-1/2 year high of 332 basis points. <DE10IT10=RR>
    Portuguese and Spanish bonds, that have been resilient so
far through the Italian budget worries, were also sold, with
several analysts suggesting that this was the first sign of
contagion from Italy. [GVD/EUR]
    Italian stocks <.FTSEMIB> tumbled nearly 1.2 percent, while
its bank stocks <.FTIT8300> in particular fell almost 3 percent.
    The news also weighed on the euro, which fell to a two-month
low. <EUR=D4> [FRX/]
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP (Italian government bond)
yields moved notably higher ""correlations could well strengthen
and this would provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the
tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the
European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.
    Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an
interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this
week, they were projecting an increase next September.

    Stock markets all round were a bit lacklustre: data showing
China's economy growing at its slowest pace since 2009 weighed
on shares in Asia, although Chinese shares staged a recovery

    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan

    Australian shares <.AXJO> fell 0.05 percent and Japan's

 (Adds details, quote, updates prices)
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The pound rose on Friday after
European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal with
the United Kingdom was 90 percent done, although political
uncertainty in Britain kept the gains in check.
    Barnier also warned that failure to resolve the Irish border
question could still derail any deal.
    More positive noises out of Brussels about reaching a Brexit
trade agreement - the dominant driver of sterling - have been
offset by growing unhappiness within Prime Minister Theresa
May's own party and her rivals about the sort of Brexit
agreement she wants to forge.
    ""A domestic political storm may well be about to hit London.
The latest move to extend the transition period beyond December
2020 looks to have really destabilised the domestic political
landscape,"" said MUFG analysts in a note.
    ""A break below $1.3000 in GBP/USD looks inevitable now, and
of course this scenario reinforces EUR/USD downside risks as
well.""       
    Sterling rose to a day's high versus the dollar of $1.3038
<GBP=D3> after Barnier's comments, before extending to as high
as $1.3047.
    Official data showing Britain's government recorded a
smaller budget deficit than expected in September also provided
some support to the currency. [nL9N0PR02N]
    The pound was 0.2 percent higher against the euro to 87.785
pence <EURGBP=D3>. 
    ""Ninety percent of the accord on the table has been agreed
with Britain,"" Barnier told France Inter radio, adding that the
Irish border issue remained a sticking point and could derail
any agreement. [nP6N1WB00B]
    On Thursday, May and other EU leaders voiced renewed
confidence that they could secure a Brexit deal, yet the two
sides remain at odds over how to deal with their only land
border, between the British province of Northern Ireland and
Ireland. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    May had also signalled that she would consider extending a
so-called transition period ""for a matter of months"" after
Britain leaves the EU at the end of March.
    Britain's Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Friday it
would be hard to resolve the issue of a backstop to the Irish
border problem in Brexit talks without more detail on the future
relationship with the EU after Brexit. [nL9N1SI02M]
    In a note to clients on Friday, RBC analysts said there had
been no improvement ""whatsoever"" in British export performance
despite sterling tumbling and remaining weak since the British
voted to leave the EU in 2016.
    ""Unless domestic demand surprises to the upside, which seems
unlikely, we still see downside export surprises as a key
vulnerability for UK rates and GBP,"" they said.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government is trying a risky gamble. Its promise to boost
spending has triggered a clash with the European Commission.
Lengthy procedures mean the spat could drag on until European
Parliament elections in May. With radical parties gaining
ground, the next Commission may be more lenient or weaker. But
intense market pressure could spoil the plan.
    Rome’s EU-sceptic coalition partners – the 5-Star Movement
and the League – want to boost the budget deficit to 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2019 to fulfil expensive electoral promises. That’s
below an EU’s self-imposed cap of 3 percent but above the 1.8
percent deficit target this year. And it breaches EU rules that
require countries to cut their deficit to lower debt,
particularly when, like Italy, their borrowing is as high as 131
percent of GDP.
    Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, engaged in an
escalating slanging match with Italian leaders, wants budget
changes, and could open an excessive deficit procedure, a
process that can lead to fines. Such threats could fall on deaf
ears in Italy. Italy’s spending plans are popular with voters,
while the EU is not. Only 44 percent of Italians in an October
Eurobarometer poll backed the union, the lowest proportion of
any EU country. 
    Rome knows that a formal EU censure would take time. Italy
has until December to approve its budget. And the Commission
would be unwise to act before April, when it might have data
showing Italy’s debt will not fall. That’s just a month before
EU voters choose the next Parliament, which will approve
Juncker’s successor, and vet commissioners. Rising support for
anti-EU movements means mainstream conservative and socialist
parties will not be able to control the assembly. The new
executive would reflect a more fragmented and radical political
landscape, and could turn out to be less rigid than the present
one, or weaker.  
    While the EU process is lengthy, bond markets’ judgment can
be swift. Interest rates on Italy's 10-year sovereign debt have
risen to a four-year peak of 4.2 percent. The turmoil could hit
the economy, and trigger banks’ insolvencies. It could also
strain the bickering coalition and prompt a government collapse.
Italy’s budget gamble is already backfiring.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Oct. 18 his
coalition government would move ahead with a planned
expansionary budget despite criticism from the European
Commission and the risk of fines for breaching euro zone fiscal
rules.
    - Italy is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
in 2019 to finance measures including wider unemployment
benefits and an early retirement scheme, up from a target
deficit of 1.8 percent this year. The budget contravenes EU
rules that require Italy and other indebted countries to
steadily narrow the fiscal deficit to zero.
    - The European Commission said the budget plans would
constitute an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules in a
letter to Rome on Oct. 18. The Commission has the power to
launch a so-called excessive deficit procedure against Italy
that could ultimately lead to a fine.
    - Italy’s public debt stood at around 131 percent of GDP in
2017, the second-highest as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone
after Greece.
    - Italian 10-year government bond yields rose to 4.2 percent
in early morning trading on Oct. 19, the highest level in
four-and-a-half years.

should reach 235 million euros ($270 million), or 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product, this year versus 0.1 percent in 2017,
the statistics office said on Friday, citing the forecast of the
finance ministry.
    The surplus will be larger than the finance ministry
forecast a year ago, when it was projected at 0.4 percent of
GDP.
    The office also said public debt will increase to 32.1
billion euros this year from 31.9 billion in 2017, but economic
growth will decrease it as a percentage of GDP. It will reach
70.3 percent of GDP this year versus 74.1 percent last year.
    Slovenia, which narrowly avoided an international bailout of
its banks in 2013, returned to growth a year later. A robust
expansion, based on exports, investments and household spending,
enabled it to erase budget deficits and reduce debt.
    Finance Minister Andrej Bertoncelj said last week the
country expects a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2019 and debt
is due to fall to 66.6 percent of GDP, mainly because of
economic growth [nL8N1WR47N].
    The government expects the economy to expand by 3.7 percent
in 2019 versus 4.4 percent this year [nL8N1WD3MO].

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - For a company that
claims to be on the forefront of industrial technology, ABB
<ABBN.S> is strangely behind the times when it comes to
financial engineering. Recent restructuring by European
heavyweights like Thyssenkrupp <TKAG.DE> and Siemens <SIEGn.DE>
makes the Swiss-Swedish group’s power grids unit look even more
conspicuous. Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer would be best to
spin it off entirely.
    The $45 billion group is considering selling all or part of
the business that sells kit to power-grid operators, Reuters
reported. Activist Cevian Capital - its second largest
shareholder after Investor AB <INVEb.ST>, the vehicle of
Sweden’s Wallenberg family – has long pushed for a separation to
increase management focus. Yet after a strategy review,
Spiesshofer in October 2016 opted to keep the business.
    Shares in the group that makes everything from factory
robots to circuit breakers have fallen 3.5 percent since then,
while the Thomson Reuters Europe Industrials Index rose 14
percent over the same period. The power unit earned $10.4
billion of revenue in 2017, 2 percent less in comparable terms
than the previous year. Sales shrunk at an average of 6 percent
year-on-year in the first two financial quarters of 2018. Back
in 2016, Spiesshofer set a target for the division to earn a
margin on earnings before interest, tax and amortization of
between 10 percent and 14 percent. It managed just 9.7 percent
in the first half of the year.
    That’s admittedly an improvement on the margin of around 5
percent and 7 percent the business reported in 2014 and 2015.
Peers like Siemens, Crompton Greaves <CROP.NS>, Hubbell <HUBB.N>
 and Fluor <FLR.N> trade on an average multiple of just over 1.2
times revenue. Even assuming a 20 percent discount, ABB’s
business would now be worth around $10 billion. Still,
Spiesshofer has failed to show that there are synergies between
it and the rest of the company. Power grids President Claudio
Facchin could probably have pulled off the same turnaround as
CEO of an independent company.
    ABB currently favours a majority sale, Reuters says. That
would be fine if, say, an infrastructure investor like Macquarie
were to offer a premium valuation and Spiesshofer returned cash
to investors. Failing that, he should just hand the company
straight to shareholders. A messy partial sale would fail to fix
ABB’s conglomerate discount, and muddy corporate governance.
Germany’s Thyssenkrupp last month said it will spin off its
elevators, car parts and plant engineering businesses to
shareholders. Spiesshofer should consider similarly radical
financial retooling.

    - ABB is exploring a sale of its power grids business,
Reuters reported on Oct. 18 citing people familiar with the
matter. 
    - ABB is examining various options for its second-largest
but lowest-margin business, Reuters reported citing three
sources. A decision is likely by early next year. 
    - ""A sale of a majority is the preferred option at moment,
although selling a minority or spinning it off are also
possible,” one source told Reuters.
    - Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer two years ago said he
would keep the unit that sells power-plant equipment and
services to utility companies, defying activist shareholder
Cevian Capital.
    - Credit Suisse and investment banking boutique Dyal Co. are

International's (RBI) <RBIV.VI> businesses in Russia, Ukraine
and Romania are growing steadily and will help the lender to
exceed its core capital ratio target this year, finance chief
Martin Gruell said.    
    RBI, which operates across eastern Europe from the Czech
Republic to Russia and down to the Balkans, aims to reach a
fully loaded common equity tier 1 (CET 1) ratio, a measure of
capital strength, of around 13 percent post dividend in the
medium term. 
    ""We will significantly exceed our 13 percent target by
year-end,"" Gruell told an investor fair in Vienna.  
    The bank plans to reward shareholders with a dividend ""not
lower than last year's,"" he added.
     For 2017, RBI paid 0.62 euros per share, its first dividend
in four years after it went through a radical restructuring in
the wake of the financial crisis.   
    When asked about the bank's nearly 20 percent share price
drop since the beginning of the year, the finance chief said
this was mainly due to worries about an escalation of tensions
between the U.S. and Russia. The shares slipped 2 percent on
Friday.
    He said he expected ""record earnings"" in Romania and a
profit of more than 100 million euros ($114.52 million) in
Ukraine. Growth in Russia was continuing. 
    Russia is an important market for RBI as it has just under
10 percent of its assets there, but the lender said earlier that
only 0.1 percent of its total assets were linked to companies
directly affected by sanctions. [nL5N1SM19R]     
    ""It is primarily the fear of more sanctions in Russia,"" 
Gruell said, adding that nervousness before the U.S.
congressional elections in November obviously played a role.

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    EARLY MORNING HEADLINE ROUND-UP: CHINA, CONSTRUCTION, AUTOS IN FOCUS (0546 GMT)
    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

    * Vontobel's U.S. deal with Lombard Odier highlights trend
    * Local players still dominate U.S. private banking market

    By Angelika Gruber
    ZURICH, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ten years after a booming
business with discretion-minded U.S. clients cost Swiss banks
billions of dollars and put an end to Swiss banking secrecy, the
world's private banking hub is looking to reestablish ties with
American customers.
    Facing a highly competitive and largely saturated Swiss
market and sluggish growth prospects in Europe, Swiss money
managers are now courting wealthy Americans who might be seeking
to invest some of their cash abroad. More billionaires hail from
the United States than from anywhere else.
    Vontobel <VONN.S>, for example, is to buy rival Lombard
Odier's international portfolio of U.S.-based clients with 1.2
billion Swiss francs ($1.21 billion) in assets under management
as it expands in the region. [nL8N1WZ0QD]
    That will boost the 2.4 billion francs Vontobel's own North
American-focused Swiss Wealth Advisors now manages.
    ""North America is one of our focus markets in which we
intend to achieve above-average growth,"" Georg Schubiger, head
of Vontobel Wealth Management, said on Friday.
    The bank aims to manage 5 billion Swiss francs for U.S.
private banking clients, Chief Executive Zeno Staub said.
    UBS <UBSG.S>, Switzerland's biggest bank and the world's
largest wealth manager, has maintained a large U.S. presence
even after $780 million in settlements with U.S. authorities
over undeclared assets U.S. clients had held with the bank.
    It books onshore business for North American clients in
offices in New York and across the country, accounting for
roughly half the bank's wealth management business. 
    UBS, like other Swiss money managers, is looking to court
U.S. expats as well. After merging its North American and
international wealth management businesses this year, it sees
opportunities with U.S. customers living and booking money
abroad.
    The bank is expected to announce more details at an investor
day on Oct. 25. 
   
    COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE
    Size matters now that special regulations from U.S.
authorities -- particularly the Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act and also from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
-- have made offshore business with American customers more
complex.
    ""As a rule of thumb, you need about $2 billion in managed
assets, which is quite a lot for small banks in a single
market,"" Ralph Kreis, director of consulting firm AlixPartners,
said.
    Business below that threshold is worthwhile only for
institutions focusing on a specific segment or particularly
profitable customers, he added. 
    Many banks have faced challenges in building or rebuilding
business with U.S. customers, Kreis said.
    This has dissuaded major private banks -- including
Switzerland's second-biggest, Credit Suisse <CSGN.S>, and
third-largest listed bank, Julius Baer <BAER.S> -- from offering
wealth management services within the United States.
    While the U.S. domestic private banking market is largely
dominated by local players like Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N>, Swiss
banks see lucrative opportunities in courting Americans seeking
to do safe business offshore.
    
    SAFE HAVEN
    Very wealthy individuals tend to diversify their assets over
several regions, and Swiss banks see a role in offering
tax-compliant investment opportunities in a stable country with
a crisis-proof currency.
    ""We offer a safe haven,"" said Vontobel manager Patrice E.
Humbel, responsible for the U.S. market. 
    ""Two-thirds of our customers have European DNA. They are
Germans, Italians, French or Swiss who are first-, second- or
third-generation U.S. citizens.""
    Above a certain size, banks need a licence from the SEC to
be able to offer investment products to U.S. citizens. 
    ""In Switzerland, there are about 40 to 50 firms with this
licence,"" AlixPartners' Martin Buechel said.
    That number has roughly doubled over the last four years,
said Anne Liebgott, a consultant who provides information for
Americans seeking Swiss wealth management services.
    For practical and regulatory purposes, many banks separate
their U.S. business into distinct units that operate
independently and offer tailored products.
    Geneva-based private bank Pictet said it now manages $6.2
billion in assets out of its Pictet North America Advisors
division, while UBS subsidiary Swiss Financial Advisors said it
manages around 5 billion Swiss francs.

idea of an extension to a Brexit transition period during which
Britain would keep EU rules in place after it leaves the bloc, a

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy’s radical
government is trying a risky gamble. Its promise to boost
spending has triggered a clash with the European Commission.
Lengthy procedures mean the spat could drag on until European
Parliament elections in May. With radical parties gaining
ground, the next Commission may be more lenient or weaker. But
intense market pressure could spoil the plan.
    Rome’s EU-sceptic coalition partners – the 5-Star Movement
and the League – want to boost the budget deficit to 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2019 to fulfil expensive electoral promises. That’s
below an EU’s self-imposed cap of 3 percent but above the 1.8
percent deficit target this year. And it breaches EU rules that
require countries to cut their deficit to lower debt,
particularly when, like Italy, their borrowing is as high as 131
percent of GDP.
    Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, engaged in an
escalating slanging match with Italian leaders, wants budget
changes, and could open an excessive deficit procedure, a
process that can lead to fines. Such threats could fall on deaf
ears in Italy. Italy’s spending plans are popular with voters,
while the EU is not. Only 44 percent of Italians in an October
Eurobarometer poll backed the union, the lowest proportion of
any EU country. 
    Rome knows that a formal EU censure would take time. Italy
has until December to approve its budget. And the Commission
would be unwise to act before April, when it might have data
showing Italy’s debt will not fall. That’s just a month before
EU voters choose the next Parliament, which will approve
Juncker’s successor, and vet commissioners. Rising support for
anti-EU movements means mainstream conservative and socialist
parties will not be able to control the assembly. The new
executive would reflect a more fragmented and radical political
landscape, and could turn out to be less rigid than the present
one, or weaker.  
    While the EU process is lengthy, bond markets’ judgment can
be swift. Interest rates on Italy's 10-year sovereign debt have
risen to a four-year peak of 4.2 percent. The turmoil could hit
the economy, and trigger banks’ insolvencies. It could also
strain the bickering coalition and prompt a government collapse.
Italy’s budget gamble is already backfiring.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Oct. 18 his
coalition government would move ahead with a planned
expansionary budget despite criticism from the European
Commission and the risk of fines for breaching euro zone fiscal
rules.
    - Italy is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
in 2019 to finance measures including wider unemployment
benefits and an early retirement scheme, up from a target
deficit of 1.8 percent this year. The budget contravenes EU
rules that require Italy and other indebted countries to
steadily narrow the fiscal deficit to zero.
    - The European Commission said the budget plans would
constitute an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules in a
letter to Rome on Oct. 18. The Commission has the power to
launch a so-called excessive deficit procedure against Italy
that could ultimately lead to a fine.
    - Italy’s public debt stood at around 131 percent of GDP in
2017, the second-highest as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone
after Greece.
    - Italian 10-year government bond yields rose to 4.2 percent
in early morning trading on Oct. 19, the highest level in
four-and-a-half years.

dwindled since the United States pulled out of the international
nuclear deal with Tehran, data showed on Friday, despite
Berlin's attempts to shield companies from renewed U.S.
sanctions against Tehran.
    Data from the Association of German Banks (BdB) showed
exports down 4 percent to 1.8 billion euros over the first eight
months of the year, while the threat of long-arm U.S. sanctions
had largely frozen banks' export finance activities.
    President Donald Trump caused dismay across Europe when he
withdrew from the 2015 multilateral agreement aimed at
containing Iran's nuclear programme in May and reimposed
sanctions in August.
    Trump called the deal flawed in Iran's favour.
Co-signatories including Germany, France and Britain say it is
the best way to ensure Iran gets no nuclear bomb. Iran has
warned it could leave the pact if its economic benefits are not
protected.
    Europe's giant manufacturing exporters, who had been keen to
expand their business with a large, and now potentially
fast-growing and wealthy new market, were particularly hard hit
by the decision. Germany is the West's biggest exporter to Iran.
    But despite efforts by European governments to help
companies continue their business with the Islamic Republic,
both banks and exporters have had to draw in their horns.
    This week, Holger Bingmann, head of the association of
German exporters, said the fall in Iran export volumes so far
was ""just the beginning of a downward spiral"".
    The European Union is considering creating a Special Purpose
Vehicle (SPV) to enable trade with Iran and more broadly help
the bloc avoid the extraterritorial reach of U.S. law.

    IT'S NOT LIKE BEFORE THE FEB CORRECTION - IT'S WORSE (1207 GMT)
    Those who believe we are just a few days or weeks away from another February-style
correction must bear in mind that the current market environment is actually way worse than it
was at the time. 
    As noted by Makor strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre in his Trans-Market-Express
newsletter, ""back in February this year, most leading equity markets were still in the green
across the blue planet; now, they are - almost universally – in the red"". 
    ""Central bankers in general and the Fed in particular were a lot less hawkish,"" he also
recalls while pointing out that crucially, the U.S. and EU equity stars - mainly tech and luxury
shares - were still shining, quite unlike today.  
    Another point which could be made is that the trade war situation is arguably much worse:
pundits and analysts were expecting Trump to back down ahead of the November mid-term and this 
is no longer the case. 
    For Kevin Muir, the 'MacroTourist' of East West Investment Management, progress on the trade
front is a pre-requisite to invest in equities.          
    ""Absent that, I think rallies should be sold,"" he writes.
     As Barbier de la Serre also notes: ""the February mayhem eventually proved to be mostly
technical in nature, and hence the relative brevity of its spasms"".
    No guarantees it will end so well this time if you add on Brexit and the Italian budget
crisis. 
    See below how world markets have taken a turn for the worse since February at the exception
of Wall Street:

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

    AUTOS DRIVE INTO A DITCH AS DAIMLER WARNS ON PROFIT (1337 GMT)
    As if the autos & parts sector needed any more bad news after Michelin's outlook cut this
morning... a surprise profit warning from German carmaker Daimler has sent its shares sliding to
a five-year low. 
    The sector's sinking down 3.5 percent at its lowest in two years and set for its worst day
since the Brexit vote selloff (see below). 
    Daimler blamed its profit warning on government measures concerning its diesel vehicles, and
said earnings would be significantly below last year's level. [nL8N1WZ4DQ]
    Peugeot, Renault, Valeo, are all down 4 to 5 percent while Volkswagen and BMW are falling
2.5 and 1.5 percent. Sales figures from the two French carmakers next week will be under quite a
cloud of worry in the sector...

    IT'S NOT LIKE BEFORE THE FEB CORRECTION - IT'S WORSE (1207 GMT)
    Those who believe we are just a few days or weeks away from another February-style
correction must bear in mind that the current market environment is actually way worse than it
was at the time. 
    As noted by Makor strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre in his Trans-Market-Express
newsletter, ""back in February this year, most leading equity markets were still in the green
across the blue planet; now, they are - almost universally – in the red"". 
    ""Central bankers in general and the Fed in particular were a lot less hawkish,"" he also
recalls while pointing out that crucially, the U.S. and EU equity stars - mainly tech and luxury
shares - were still shining, quite unlike today.  
    Another point which could be made is that the trade war situation is arguably much worse:
pundits and analysts were expecting Trump to back down ahead of the November mid-term and this 
is no longer the case. 
    For Kevin Muir, the 'MacroTourist' of East West Investment Management, progress on the trade
front is a pre-requisite to invest in equities.          
    ""Absent that, I think rallies should be sold,"" he writes.
     As Barbier de la Serre also notes: ""the February mayhem eventually proved to be mostly
technical in nature, and hence the relative brevity of its spasms"".
    No guarantees it will end so well this time if you add on Brexit and the Italian budget
crisis. 
    See below how world markets have taken a turn for the worse since February at the exception
of Wall Street:

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    EARLY MORNING HEADLINE ROUND-UP: CHINA, CONSTRUCTION, AUTOS IN FOCUS (0546 GMT)
    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

    By Tommy Wilkes and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The formation of Italy's
anti-establishment government and its intensifying row with
European Union authorities have lifted correlations between the
country's bonds and the euro to the highest since 2013. 
    That could be read as a sign of stress, namely worries that
Italy's woes would threaten the single currency. But lack of
contagion in other euro bond markets suggests otherwise, and
some reckon it may reflect expectations of European Central Bank
policy action should the dispute over Italy's budget escalate.
    Italian borrowing costs have surged to the highest since
early 2014, while the gap between 10-year German and Italian
government bonds - known as the Bund/BTP spread and a key
measure of Italian risk -- is also at its highest in more than
five years <IT10DE10=RR>
    But unlike the 2010-2012 Greek crisis, there has been little
spillover into other euro zone bond markets. Instead, it is the
euro that is feeling the blowback, approaching 15-month lows
<EUR=EBS> [L8N1WS26W].
    It has lost 6.6 percent versus the dollar since Italy's
early-March election that returned two parties once keen on a
return to the lira.
    Some of that is probably down to the dollar's rally, fuelled
by a strengthening U.S. economy. But there is also evidence that
the inverse correlation between the euro/dollar rate and the
BTP/Bund spread has strengthened considerably this year, meaning
the euro weakened each time the spread widened, as the following
chart shows:
   
    The inverse correlation, based on a 130-day period, rose to
87 percent at the end of August. In January, correlation was
near zero, Reuters analysis shows. Currently it stands at 84
percent.
    Correlations were previously this negative in late-2012/
early-2013, just after ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do
""whatever it takes"" to save the single currency.
    The inverse correlation clearly reflects concern that
populist politicians will pursue fiscally unsustainable policies
that euro zone authorities can do little to stop.
    But markets also clearly retain faith in Draghi's promise,
with bets growing he will act if the Italian situation worsens.
That in itself makes the current bubbling crisis different from
2012 in that the bloc's existence is not seen at risk.
    ""There is a view which is not really consensus yet, but
there is momentum towards the view that the ECB will probably
adopt a more dovish exit than what has been priced, as a result
of Italy and also because of expansion not being that strong,""
said Shweta Singh, senior economist at TS Lombard.
    So each time the Italian situation appears to worsen and
spreads widen, bets grow on ECB action, possibly by delaying
rate rises, currently expected next September. 
    On Friday, after the EU called the Italian draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of fiscal rules, the euro dipped to as
low as $1.1433 and the BTP/Bund spread widened to a fresh 5
1/2-year high [nL8N1WY213] [nL8N1WZ16J].
    Money markets, meanwhile, cut their bets on a September 2019
rate rise by the ECB. Bets have instead been pushed back to next
October.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Shares in Spanish
lenders dropped sharply after a court ruled banks may have to
refund mortgage taxes. That could mean a collective hit to
earnings of up to 1.5 bln euros, based on the last four years of
new loans. With lending rates set to rise, that’s painful but
manageable.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Spain's Supreme Court said it would review a ruling on
mortgage stamp duty on Oct. 19, a day after stating that banks
had to pay the tax, sparking a sector-wide selloff. 
    - The court said that as the ruling was a ""radical change""
in its criteria and had an ""enormous economic and social
impact"", a senior judge agreed to suspend all pending appeals on
the matter, Reuters reported. 
    - Shares in Spanish banks fell sharply on Oct. 18 after the
court said lenders must pay stamp duty on mortgage loans which
had previously been paid by customers, raising the prospect of
potentially billions of euros in compensation. 
    - “The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,” the court
said in a document, cited by Reuters on Oct. 18. 
    - After the court ruling, shares in Bankia fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell and Caixabank fell 6 percent and
5.5 percent, respectively.

    BEARS TIGHTENING THEIR GRIP OVER MSCI WORLD SHARES (1426 GMT)
    Some 58 percent of shares in the MSCI World index have fallen in bear market territory, a
proportion which has risen from last week, BAML reveals in its latest edition of The Flow Show. 
    The number now stands at 1,609 shares out of 2,767 shares, up from 1,557 shares, according
to the figures of Oct. 11.
    Because Wall Street seems somewhat immune to the woes of global markets, the following
figure might send a shiver or two down the neck of complacent investors: 46 percent of NYSE
stocks are in bear market territory as we speak. 
    On the bright side, bears don't always get it right:

    AUTOS DRIVE INTO A DITCH AS DAIMLER WARNS ON PROFIT (1337 GMT)
    As if the autos & parts sector needed any more bad news after Michelin's outlook cut this
morning... a surprise profit warning from German carmaker Daimler has sent its shares sliding to
a five-year low. 
    The sector's sinking down 3.5 percent at its lowest in two years and set for its worst day
since the Brexit vote selloff (see below). 
    Daimler blamed its profit warning on government measures concerning its diesel vehicles, and
said earnings would be significantly below last year's level. [nL8N1WZ4DQ]
    Peugeot, Renault, Valeo, are all down 4 to 5 percent while Volkswagen and BMW are falling
2.5 and 1.5 percent. Sales figures from the two French carmakers next week will be under quite a
cloud of worry in the sector...

    IT'S NOT LIKE BEFORE THE FEB CORRECTION - IT'S WORSE (1207 GMT)
    Those who believe we are just a few days or weeks away from another February-style
correction must bear in mind that the current market environment is actually way worse than it
was at the time. 
    As noted by Makor strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre in his Trans-Market-Express
newsletter, ""back in February this year, most leading equity markets were still in the green
across the blue planet; now, they are - almost universally – in the red"". 
    ""Central bankers in general and the Fed in particular were a lot less hawkish,"" he also
recalls while pointing out that crucially, the U.S. and EU equity stars - mainly tech and luxury
shares - were still shining, quite unlike today.  
    Another point which could be made is that the trade war situation is arguably much worse:
pundits and analysts were expecting Trump to back down ahead of the November mid-term and this 
is no longer the case. 
    For Kevin Muir, the 'MacroTourist' of East West Investment Management, progress on the trade
front is a pre-requisite to invest in equities.          
    ""Absent that, I think rallies should be sold,"" he writes.
     As Barbier de la Serre also notes: ""the February mayhem eventually proved to be mostly
technical in nature, and hence the relative brevity of its spasms"".
    No guarantees it will end so well this time if you add on Brexit and the Italian budget
crisis. 
    See below how world markets have taken a turn for the worse since February at the exception
of Wall Street:

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    It's more of the same from European results today with some recurring themes emerging:
companies are flagging challenges in the construction industry, China, and new emissions
regulations hitting autos. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profit, blaming difficulties in its construction
businesses. 
    Michelin also cut its sales forecasts and market growth forecasts due to weaker Chinese car
demand and the new emissions regulations - issues raised by Goldman analysts in their note
earlier this week. [nL8N1WX2RP]

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The pound rose on Friday after EU
Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal with the United
Kingdom was 90 percent done, although undercurrents of
uncertainty in Britain kept the gains in check.
    More positive noises out of Brussels about reaching a Brexit
agreement - the dominant driver of sterling - have been offset
by growing unease within Prime Minister Theresa May's
Conservative party about the sort of deal she is hoping to
forge.
    ""A domestic political storm may well be about to hit London.
The latest move to extend the (Brexit) transition period beyond
December 2020 looks to have really destabilised the domestic
political landscape,"" said MUFG analysts in a note.
    ""A break below $1.3000 in GBP/USD looks inevitable now.""    
  
    Sterling rose immediately <GBP=D3> after Barnier's comments,
before extending to as high as $1.3061 in late European trading.
    It rose as much as 0.2 percent against the euro at 87.785
pence <EURGBP=D3> before settling at 87.995 pence.
    Data showing Britain's government recorded a smaller budget
deficit than expected in September also provided some support to
the currency. [nL9N0PR02N]
    On Thursday, May and other EU leaders voiced renewed
confidence that they could secure a Brexit deal, yet the two
sides remain at odds over how to deal with their only land
border, between the British province of Northern Ireland and
Ireland. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    Barnier said on Friday that failure to resolve that issue
could still derail any deal. [nP6N1WB00B]
    Britain's foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Friday it
would be hard to resolve the issue of a backstop to the Irish
border problem in Brexit talks with the EU without more detail
on their future relationship. [nL9N1SI02M]
    In a note to clients on Friday, RBC analysts said there had
been no improvement in Britain's export performance despite
sterling tumbling and remaining weak since the British voted to
leave the EU in 2016.
    ""Unless domestic demand surprises to the upside, which seems
unlikely, we still see downside export surprises as a key
vulnerability for UK rates and GBP,"" they said.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 19: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Siena PMI 2016 
S.r.l., agranular cash flow securitisation of mortgage and non-mortgage loans 
granted to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) located in Italy. 

The transaction's revolving period ended in February 2018 such that the 
transaction is now static. The underlying loans were originated by Banca Monte 
dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. (B/Stable).

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

No Subsequent Purchases Quickens Deleveraging

No subsequent portfolios were sold to the issuer between the last rating action 
until February 2018, the end of the revolving period. The originator has 
repurchased part of the pool, leading to rapid amortisation of the notes with 
the full repayment of the class A1 notes , and increase in credit enhancement 
(CE) for the remaining rated notes. The largest increase in CE was seen in the 
class A2 notes at 85.9%, from 69.3% a year ago. Ratings for the class A and B 
notes are capped by Italy's Country Ceiling of 'AA'.

Partial Redemption of Subordinated Notes 

Available funds were incorrectly allocated to redeem the junior notes. As a 
result the principal funds paid to the senior notes was less than it would 
otherwise have been. The servicer has informed Fitch that the junior notes will 
not be amortised further until all senior notes have been redeemed in line with 
the documentation. The notes' ratings are not impacted as the portfolio has 
amortised much faster than initially expected, leading to a significant increase 
in CE for all the rated notes.

Improved Loan Book Performance

Although updated data received by the originator shows a continued trend of 
improvement in the bank loan book performance, Fitch has kept the default 
probability assumptions of the bank loan book at 6%, compared to with a country 
benchmark for Italy of 4.75%, as the observed default rates tend to average 6%. 
The considerable gap of the bank benchmark to the country benchmark is, in 
Fitch's view, reasonable giventhe continued negative rating migration in the 
transaction's underlying pool.

Pool Performance within Expectations

Cumulative defaults, including loans that migrated into 'default status' after 
being bought backby the bank , increased to currently 3.3% of the initial pool 
from 0.7% a year ago. The cumulative default rate would have increased to 4.18% 
(from 1.75% last year) if we had factored in loans with an internal probabilty 
of default (PD) of 100%, as per latest loan-by-loan data; these loans are not 
yet in arrears for more than 300 days/or classified as sofferenzas. The 
cumulative default rate of 4.18% is still within Fitch's expectations.

Capped Ratings

The class A and B ratings are subject to a cap on Italian structured finance 
transactions at Italy's Country Ceiling of 'AA'. 

Counterparty Risks

The class C notes would have no liquidity coverage once they become the most 
senior notes and are therefore exposed to servicer interruption risk. The 
servicer is currently rated (B/Stable) but the transaction also includes a 
back-up servicing agreement with Securitisation Services S.p.A. ThereforeFitch 
has capped the rating at 'BBBsf' for the class C notes andchanged the Outlook to 
Stable from Positive.

DUE DILIGENCE 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

A 125% default multiplier applied to the portfolio's mean default rate, and with 
this increase added to all rating default levels, would lead to a downgrade of 
up to two notches for the rated notes.

Decreasing the recovery rates assigned to the underlying obligors by 25% could 
result in a downgrade of up to four notches for the rated notes.

DATA ADEQUACY 

Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has 
received about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There were 
no findings that affected the rating analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the 
results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio information or 
conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring.

Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party 
assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information and concluded that there 
were no findings that affected the rating analysis.

Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted 
sample of the originator's origination files and found the information contained 
in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies 
and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset 
portfolio.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's 
rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that 
it is adequately reliable.

    * Italian bond yields fall across the curve
    * BTP/Bund spread falls from 5-1/2 year highs

 (Updates with detail on Moscovici comments, price action)
    By Dhara Ranasinghe and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italy's government bond yields
fell from 4-1/2 year highs and its stock market rallied on
Friday after European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici said he wanted to reduce tensions with Italy over the
country's contentious budget plans.
    Speaking at a news conference after a two-day visit to Rome,
Moscovici said Brussels shared Italy's declared goals of
boosting growth and cutting debt, and reiterated that no
decision had yet been taken over the budget.
    He said he did not fear contagion to other euro zone
countries stemming from the market tensions over Italy.
[nR1N1W5006]
    His remarks brought relief to Italian markets just a day
after a letter from the European Commission stepped up pressure
over the budget, labelling it an unprecedented breach of EU
fiscal rules, and sparking another violent selloff.[nL8N1WZ16J]
    ""It is hard to believe that he (Moscovici) is making these
comments having sent the letter yesterday. It shows his change
of tone and indicates that Brussels is mindful of the market
reaction and the corresponding risks,"" said Michael Leister,
rates strategist at Commerzbank.
    ""There was a new dimension in the sell-off in reaction to
this letter, Spain and Portugal showed clear sings of contagion
and Brussels has realised it wasn't the best strategy to
escalate the situation.""
    Italian bond yields were up to 17 basis points lower on the
day, fully reversing earlier rises. [nL8N1WZ16J]
    Ten-year bond yields were down 10 bps at 3.57 percent
<IT10YT=RR>, down from a 4-1/2 year high hit earlier at 3.78
percent.
    Thirty-year bond yields fell from a 4-1/2 year high of
around 4.15 percent <IT30YT=RR>, while two-year yields were down
17 bps after rising almost 20 bps on Thursday. 
    The 10-year bond yield gap over safer Germany -- effectively
the risk premium on Italian bonds -- narrowed to 312 bps, having
hit its widest in 5-1/2 years at around 338 bps.    
    As Italy's bond market rallied, the country's top stock
index <.FTMIB> climbed into positive territory, trading up 0.25
percent. The bank stocks index <.FTIT8300> also rapidly pared
losses, last trading up 0.03 percent. 
    Banking stocks had come under heavy selling pressure earlier
in the day from the renewed spike in sovereign bond yields.
    Italian lenders hold around 375 billion euros of domestic
bonds - accounting for 10 percent of their assets - and the
spike in yields, by eroding the value of those holdings, eats
into their capital levels.
    Earlier on Friday, five-year credit default swaps in Italian
bank UniCredit <CRDI.MI> rose to 204 basis points, from a
closing price of 194 bps on Thursday and was the highest since
Dec 2016 <UNIC5YEUAM=MG>. [nL8N1WZ3SM]
    ""Ultimately there could be a good outcome but we will get a
lot of negative headlines in between that,"" said Timothy Graf,
head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street.
    ""But Italy isn't Greece. Its external balances are healthier
and it's a much more important economy and I don't think the
brinkmanship that was allowable with Greece is allowable with
Italy,"" he said, referring to the Greek debt crisis.
    The recovery in Italian debt also weakened demand for bond
safe havens. 
    Germany's 10-year Bund yield rose 2 bps at 0.44 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, having hit its lowest in almost six weeks at 0.39
percent. Two-year German bond yields rose from two-month lows at
minus around 0.67 percent <DE2YT=RR>.

    CLOSING SNAPSHOT: IN TOUCHING DISTANCE OF 22-MONTH LOWS (1622 GMT) 
    This was a very choppy session with no shortage of political risks with the Italian/EU
budget row and some terrible earnings updates such as Bouyges, Sopra or Michelin. In the end
though, the STOXX limited its losses to 0.1 percent and posted a weekly gain of 0.6 percent.

    HOW TRADE WAR NEWS HURTS CHINA, NOT WALL STREET (1416 GMT) 
    Wall Street is having it both ways.
    Oxford Economics has issued a study which exposes how negative trade war news predominantly
hits Chinese shares and how, in contrast, U.S. shares benefit the most from positive news
development on the conflict. 
    Knowing how important stock markets are for Trump and that the S&P 500 is still positive 
year-to-date versus a Chinese market in bear territory, chances for his administration to back
down seem actually quite slim in this light.

    BEARS TIGHTENING THEIR GRIP OVER MSCI WORLD SHARES (1426 GMT)
    Some 58 percent of shares in the MSCI World index have fallen in bear market territory, a
proportion which has risen from last week, BAML reveals in its latest edition of The Flow Show. 
    The number now stands at 1,609 shares out of 2,767 shares, up from 1,557 shares, according
to the figures of Oct. 11.
    Because Wall Street seems somewhat immune to the woes of global markets, the following
figure might send a shiver or two down the neck of complacent investors: 46 percent of NYSE
stocks are in bear market territory as we speak. 
    On the bright side, bears don't always get it right:

    AUTOS DRIVE INTO A DITCH AS DAIMLER WARNS ON PROFIT (1337 GMT)
    As if the autos & parts sector needed any more bad news after Michelin's outlook cut this
morning... a surprise profit warning from German carmaker Daimler has sent its shares sliding to
a five-year low. 
    The sector's sinking down 3.5 percent at its lowest in two years and set for its worst day
since the Brexit vote selloff (see below). 
    Daimler blamed its profit warning on government measures concerning its diesel vehicles, and

    IT'S NOT LIKE BEFORE THE FEB CORRECTION - IT'S WORSE (1207 GMT)
    Those who believe we are just a few days or weeks away from another February-style
correction must bear in mind that the current market environment is actually way worse than it
was at the time. 
    As noted by Makor strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre in his Trans-Market-Express
newsletter, ""back in February this year, most leading equity markets were still in the green
across the blue planet; now, they are - almost universally – in the red"". 
    ""Central bankers in general and the Fed in particular were a lot less hawkish,"" he also
recalls while pointing out that crucially, the U.S. and EU equity stars - mainly tech and luxury
shares - were still shining, quite unlike today.  
    Another point which could be made is that the trade war situation is arguably much worse:
pundits and analysts were expecting Trump to back down ahead of the November mid-term and this 
is no longer the case. 
    For Kevin Muir, the 'MacroTourist' of East West Investment Management, progress on the trade
front is a pre-requisite to invest in equities.          
    ""Absent that, I think rallies should be sold,"" he writes.
     As Barbier de la Serre also notes: ""the February mayhem eventually proved to be mostly
technical in nature, and hence the relative brevity of its spasms"".
    No guarantees it will end so well this time if you add on Brexit and the Italian budget
crisis. 
    See below how world markets have taken a turn for the worse since February at the exception
of Wall Street:

    THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADS TO ""ITALEXIT"" (1005 GMT)
    Courtesy of Eric Dor, head of economic research at the IESEG School of Management in France,
here's a chart showing clearly how a chain of events could turn the EU/Italian budget crisis
into a nightmare 'Italexit' scenario for the euro zone.
    Yes, Italian government bond yields are at four-year highs, yes some in money markets are
betting the tug-of-war could force the ECB to delay its first rate rise, yes shares in Italian
banks are close to two-year lows, but no, an 'Italexit' isn't lurking around the corner, Dor
believes.  
    ""I tend to put my trust in human rationality and that a full-blown crisis is in the interest
of no one,"" he just told us, noting how high the stakes are for the Italian and the euro zone
(particularly French) banking sector.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: OUTLOOK CUTS GALORE, ITALIAN BANKS SLIDE (0754 GMT)
    No shortage of bad news coming from a range of European companies this morning with Michelin
and Bouygues both warning sales and profit, respectively, will come in lower than expected. 
    Bouygues is down 7.4 percent and Michelin is down 6.7 percent at the bottom of the CAC 40.
    Michelin's pessimistic outlook on the tyre market is weighing on rival Continental too, down
3 percent at the bottom of the DAX, and dragging the autos & parts index <.SXAP> down 1.7
percent, the worst-performing sector. 
    French consultancy and IT services firm Sopra Steria is the top faller, down 20.5 percent
after it cut its full-year earnings forecasts saying its banking software business has been hit.
    To find a silver lining among the flurry of forecast cuts you have to drill down to UK
mid-caps: Intu Properties is jumping 13 percent (to 200p) after it said it's considering a
takeover bid at 215p. 
    Overall European stocks are barely staying above water, with the STOXX 600 flat and euro
zone stocks down 0.2 percent.
    Meanwhile in Italy stocks are down 0.8 percent (with Spain's IBEX down 0.6 percent in a
typical peripheral contagion move) after a ramp-up in tensions between Italy's government and
the European Commission. Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> is sliding 2.2 percent as yields rise.

    ON OUR RADAR: MICHELIN, BOUYGUES, VOLVO, INTU (0651 GMT)
    European stocks were set to open slightly higher on Friday after a sharp fall on Thursday as
Wall Street slid. Weak GDP numbers from China are bad news for Germany’s stock market which is
the most reliant on the world’s second largest economy. 
    DAX futures were flat and IBEX futures were down 0.2 percent with peripheral spreads under
pressure as rhetoric between the European Commission and Italian government ramps up over the
budget.
    Some recurring themes were emerging from European earnings, in particular the slowdown in
China, issues in construction, and new WLTP emissions testing regulations weighing on autos. 
    Tyre maker Michelin blamed slowing Chinese car demand and emissions testing regulations for
its sales outlook cut, also downgrading its market growth forecasts for tyre demand. The stock
was indicated down 5 to 7 percent. 
    French conglomerate Bouygues warned on profits due to “difficulties” in its construction
businesses, and traders saw the shares falling 5 to 6 percent. 
    Sweden’s Volvo was the outlier, seen rising 3 to 4 percent after it beat quarterly profit
expectations thanks to strong demand for trucks and construction equipment and forecasting high
demand in its main markets of Europe and North America in 2019.
    M&A could also be a driver for UK Retail property developer Intu which confirmed on Friday
it was considering a takeover offer from a consortium formed by British billionaire John
Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were seen up 8 to 10 percent.

    A SCOLDING FROM BRUSSELS (0623 GMT)
    Expect a risk-off day after Brussels' criticism of Italy's populist budget. In a letter to
Rome, the European Commission said that the country's planned government spending was too high,
the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not
fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    While the rebuke was no surprise, it's the first step towards requesting a new budget, could
hit banking stocks as yields are rising and is likely to stir concerns about political tensions
in the common currency zone.
    ""It is likely that risk-off prevails into the weekend even if these letters are initiations
to a discussion,"" say SocGen analysts in a note this morning.

    MORNING CALL: CHINA GROWTH MISS TO WEIGH (0522 GMT)   
    German shares are expected to fall this morning after a weaker-than-expected GDP growth
number out of China - with Germany's big exporters the most sensitive to the Chinese economy's
health. Spreadbetters expect the FTSE 100 to rise, though, as the pound trades at a 10-day low
on the deadlock over Brexit.
    Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as China posted its weakest economic growth since the
global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest
rates and Italy's free-spending budget. [nL3N1WZ1UT]
    China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, missing analysts'
expectations as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States began to bite. [nL4N1WQ2N8] 
    According to spreadbetters CMC Markets, the FTSE 100 is expected to open 17 points higher at
7,044, the DAX is expected to open 17 points lower at 11,572, and the CAC 40 is expected to open
2 points lower at 5,114.

finalised, not published)
    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A report on risks to the
stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff if
Britain leaves the EU with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be finalised in coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks and the BoE have called on Brussels to take preventive
action to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives
contracts if there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern, but the private sector could
take action to mitigate risks, such as shifting contracts from
London to the EU before March.
    Once the interim report is finalised, ""we can see what
concrete steps are necessary, whether there are also some
regulatory steps that are necessary,"" Dombrovskis said.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Asked about concerns over derivatives in a no-deal Brexit,
Dombrovskis' top civil servant, Olivier Guersent, said: ""There
is no cliff.""
    ""On 30th of March... nothing happens,"" Guersent said, adding
that contracts would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
    But banks say Brussels is slow to deal with potential
contract disruption in order to pile pressure on them to staff
new hubs in the EU before March and shift the contracts to them.
    Mark Hoban, head of the IRSG, a financial services think
tank backed by the financial sector, said the sector was waiting
for regulators in Britain and the EU to sign cooperation
agreements to deal with potential disruption to contracts.
    ""My suspicion is that you have got MOUs stuck in desk
drawers on both sides of the Channel. What the regulators are
waiting for is the green light from the Commission that allows
conversations to happen.""
    Giving the green light would give markets more confidence
about Brexit Day, but instead there is unhelpful brinkmanship,
Hoban said.

    By Crispian Balmer
    ROME, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Moody's on Friday cut Italy's
sovereign debt rating to one notch above junk status because of
concerns over government budget plans, but in a move that could
calm investor anxiety, it said the outlook was stable.
    Moody's lowered the rating to ""Baa3"" from a previous ""Baa2""
just five months after warning of a possible downgrade for the
eurozone's third-largest economy.
    The ratings agency said a prime reason for its cut was the
government's recently announced budget, which forecast a deficit
of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year, three
times higher than the previous target.
    It said the shift towards an expansionary fiscal policy
meant Italy's public debt would likely remain around the current
130 percent of GDP in the coming years, rather than decline.
    ""... that makes Italy vulnerable to future domestic or
externally-sourced shocks, in particular to weaker economic
growth,"" Moody's said in a statement.
    Concerns over Rome's expansive budget plans have weighed
heavily on Italian government bonds in recent weeks, with the
spread between German and Italian benchmark 10-year paper
hitting 5-1/2 year highs on Friday.
    The coalition government, which took office in June, has
said it needs to increase spending to boost Italy's anaemic
economy. The budget promises to introduce a minimum income for
the poor, cut taxes and water down a 2011 pension reform.
    ""Most of the government's spending increases are structural
in nature, implying that they will be difficult to reverse,""
Moody's wrote.
    Moody's said the planned measures should boost the country's
output, but predicted that they would have less impact than the
government was predicting. 
    ""The economic plans of the government, while supportive of
growth in the near term, do not amount to a coherent programme
of reforms that will lift Italy's mediocre growth performance on
a sustained basis,"" it said.
    Underscoring growing concern over Italy, the European
Commission sent Rome a warning letter on Thursday over the
budget, the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to
Brussels rejecting the budget and to fines against Italy.
    The government has said it intended to plough ahead with its
budget regardless.
    Fitch on Aug. 31 cut its outlook on Italy's ""BBB"" rating to
""negative"". S&P has said it would review its ratings on Italy on
Oct. 26. The agency rates Italy's debt ""BBB"" with a stable
outlook, following an upgrade from ""BBB-"" last October.
    Moody's said it was maintaining a stable outlook because
""Italy still exhibits important credit strengths that balance
the weakening fiscal prospects.""
    It listed these strengths as Italy's large and diversified
economy, substantial current account surpluses of above 2
percent of GDP, a near balanced international investment
position and high wealth levels amongst Italian families.

    LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of supporters
of the European Union began marching through London on Saturday
as part of what organisers say will be the largest ever
demonstration to demand that the British government holds a
public vote on the terms of Brexit.    
    The protesters waved the blue and gold flag of the EU and
held up ""Bollocks to Brexit"" banners under sunny skies to call
for another referendum on the eventual deal on how Britain will
leave the world's biggest trading bloc.
    The march comes as pressure builds on Prime Minister Theresa
May over her negotiating strategy with just over five months
until Britain is due to leave. There is, so far, no divorce deal
and some rebels in May's Conservative Party have threatened to
vote down a deal if she clinches one.
    James McGrory, one of the organisers of the march, said the
public should have the chance to change their minds because the
decision will impact their lives for generations. 
    ""People think the Brexit negotiations are a total mess, they
have no faith in the government to deliver the promises that
were made, partly because they cannot be delivered,"" he said. 
    At the march, demonstrators carried placards saying ""Brexit
is pants"" and ""time for an EU turn."" Members of parliament from
all the main political parties are set to join the
demonstration.
    Organisers estimate that more than 100,000 people will take
part. Crowds will gather near Hyde Park and pass Downing Street
and finish outside of parliament.
    The 2016 referendum saw 52 percent vote in favour of leaving
the European Union. But the past two years have been politically
fraught as the government has struggled to agree on a plan and
there are fears that Britain leave the bloc without a deal.
    Some opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favour of
remaining in the European Union, but there has yet to be a
decisive change in attitudes and many in Britain say they have
become increasingly bored by Brexit.
    The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out holding a second
referendum. The opposition Labour party said last month they
open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the
bloc in certain circumstances.
    Brexit supporters say a second referendum would trigger a
major constitutional crisis.
    ""We had a vote, we voted to leave, the idea to have a second
referendum would be incredibly damaging,"" said Richard Tice,
Vice-Chairman of Leave Means Leave, which wants a clean break
with the EU.
    ""People need to be under no illusions as to how people feel
about what is a significant potential for a total betrayal of
democracy in this country.""

coalition parties met on Saturday to patch up a row over a
disputed tax amnesty which has threatened to undermine the
anti-establishment government.
    The coalition included the amnesty among measures to fund
costly electoral promises which are set to sharply lift the
budget deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output next year,
flouting European Union rules that require steady progress
towards a balanced budget.
    But the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement, the two parties in the coalition, have fallen out over
a widening of the amnesty to shield financial criminals,
including money launderers.
    Five-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has accused the League of
tricking its coalition partner by surreptitiously broadening the
scope of the amnesty in the final draft of the 2019 budget.
    League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini held
out an olive branch to his coalition partners on Friday by
saying he was ready to change contested parts of the amnesty.
    Speaking on Saturday before flying to Rome for a coalition
meeting, Salvini said he would not ""call into the question the
government over a tiny piece of legislation which the 5-Star
have changed their mind about.""
    Di Maio welcomed Salvini's decision and said the League was
""a found-again friend"".
    The coalition meeting between Di Maio, Salvini and Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte will be followed by a cabinet meeting
over the tax measures included in the 2019 budget.
    Conte ruled out a government crisis in an interview with Il
Fatto Quotidiano daily on Saturday.
    The 5-Star has opposed tax amnesties in the past but the
League, which has a traditional voter base of self-employed
businessmen, had pushed for the measure.
    Italy, which suffers from high tax evasion, has often
resorted to tax amnesties to raise money.
    The government's free-spending plans have led to a clash
with EU authorities and prompted a downgrade by Moody's which on
Friday lowered Italy's sovereign rating to one notch above junk
status. [nL3N1WZ5VO]

government
    * European Parliament vote, general election in Poland in
focus
    * EU relations a theme in campaigning

    By Pawel Florkiewicz and Pawel Sobczak
    WARSAW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Poles vote in a regional election
on Sunday with gains expected for the ruling eurosceptic Law and
Justice (PiS) party, whose nationalist rhetoric and
institutional reforms have fuelled a deepening rift with the
European Union. 
    PiS swept into power in 2015 on a promise of voter-pleasing
welfare bumps, social conservatism and more state say in the
economy. The party remains broadly popular, despite accusations
at home and abroad of a shift towards authoritarian rule.
     The election is part of a larger struggle over Europe's
future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban, a PiS ally, shake
up the European Union and right-wing parties make gains across
the continent.
    While it dominates national politics, PiS controls a small
minority of city halls, and has a majority in only one
provincial assembly out of 16.
    If successful in gaining seats, PiS will have better access
to local funding, a factor which could affect parliamentary
elections in 2019. It will also have more influence over schools
and theatres, important tools in the party's nationalist agenda.
    PiS opposes abortion, contraception and IVF fertility
treatment and wants culture and education to be more
conservative.
    ""Dear citizens, if you want more money to reach here for
infrastructure and industry, then vote for PiS candidates,""
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told voters during a rally in
Kielce in southern Poland on Oct. 13. 
    Opinion polls show PiS could win 33-37 percent of votes for
provincial assembly members. A coalition of centrist opposition
parties, the Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, is forecast to
capture about 24 percent of the vote. Post-election coalitions
could affect how many assemblies PiS will control.
    The centrist candidate for Warsaw mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski,
46, is seen winning 41-42 percent of vote on Sunday, and
securing the office in a second round of voting on Nov. 4,
beating PiS' Patryk Jaki, 33.
    A spike in PiS support in cities, traditionally centrist
strongholds, would show its brand of populism gaining broader
appeal and would be a major upset for the Civic Platform, the
home party of European Council President Donald Tusk. 
    
    ""DISAPPOINTING EU""
    A good result for PiS would add to concerns in Brussels
ahead of European Parliament elections in May by boosting 
eurosceptic groups that oppose efforts at closer EU integration.
    Underlining divisions, the EU's top court ordered the Warsaw
government on Friday to suspend an overhaul of the country's
Supreme Court and reinstate judges forced into early retirement.
    The moves were part of broader reforms of the judiciary,
which PiS says are crucial to making the system more fair and
efficient, but opponents criticise as an attack on democratic
checks and balances.
    Throughout his campaign, Warsaw's mayoral candidate Jaki
said he sides with ordinary people against what he describes as
an arrogant Civic Platform municipal elite.
    Trzaskowski, a long-time EU emissary for his party, says he
wants his native Warsaw to remain ""open, tolerant and European"".
    He accuses the PiS-run justice ministry, where Jaki is a
deputy minister and which is at the heart of the government's
conflict with Brussels over court reforms, of policies that
could lead Poland to leaving the EU.
    ""It's a straight road towards taking Poland out of the EU,""
he said on Wednesday.
    Like Orban's Fidesz party in Hungary, PiS argues the powers
of Brussels should be reined in, and accuses EU institutions of
meddling in Poland's internal affairs.
    ""It's depressing that the EU is so engaged in our politics.
I don't think it should,"" said Agnieszka Zdziuch, a 44-year-old
office worker in the town of Staszow in southern Poland.
    Voting starts at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and ends at 9
p.m., exit poll results are expected shortly afterwards.

    By Jeff Mason and David Dolan
    ELKO, Nev./ISTANBUL, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President
Donald Trump joined European leaders on Saturday in pushing
Saudi Arabia for more answers about Jamal Khashoggi after Riyadh
changed its story and acknowledged that the journalist died over
two weeks ago at its consulate in Istanbul. 
    Saudi Arabia said early on Saturday that Khashoggi, a critic
of the country's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, had died in a fight inside the building.
    Germany called that explanation ""inadequate"" and questioned
whether countries should sell arms to Saudi Arabia, while France
and the European Union urged an in-depth investigation to find
out what happened to the Washington Post columnist after he
entered the consulate on Oct. 2 for documents for his marriage.
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a Saudi national and
U.S. resident, was killed inside the consulate by a team of
Saudi agents and his body cut up.
    The Khashoggi case has caused an international outrage and
frayed political and business ties between Western powers and
U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, the world's No.1 oil exporter.
    Asked during a trip to Nevada if he was satisfied that Saudi
officials had been fired over Khashoggi's death, Trump said:
""No, I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a
big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to
the answer.""
    Trump's comments about the Khashoggi incident in recent days
have ranged from threatening Saudi Arabia with ""very severe""
consequences and warning of economic sanctions, to more
conciliatory remarks in which he has played up the country's
role as a U.S. ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well
as a major purchaser of U.S. arms. 
    He had earlier called the Saudi narrative of what happened
to Khashoggi credible.         
    Riyadh provided no evidence on Saturday to support its
account and made no mention of what had become of Khashoggi's
body. 
    French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a full
investigation and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a joint
statement with her foreign minister, said the Saudi account was
not enough.
    ""We expect transparency from Saudi Arabia about the
circumstances of his death ... The information available about
events in the Istanbul consulate is inadequate,"" the Germans
said. [nS8N1TF01O] 
    German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called into question the
sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. [nL8N1X00SH] 
    Trump said it was possible that Prince Mohammed had been
unaware of the circumstances around the death of Khashoggi, 59.
Trump said he would speak with the prince. 
    For Western allies, a main question in the Khashoggi affair
will be whether they believe that the prince, who has painted
himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman, 82, had
handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him.
    Trump, who has forged close ties with Saudi Arabia and the
crown prince, said he was concerned that it was unclear where
the journalist's body is.    
    Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened
to the body ""before long"", a senior Turkish official said
earlier on Saturday. [nL8N1X00CN]
    Officials told Reuters in Turkey on Thursday that
Khashoggi's remains may have been dumped in Belgrad Forest
adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of
Yalova, 90 km (55 miles) south of Istanbul,     
    Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording
purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate.
Pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, citing the audio,
said his torturers cut off his fingers during an interrogation
and later beheaded him.
    Trump said no one from his administration has seen video or
a transcript of what happened inside the consulate.
    A group of 15 Saudi nationals arrived in Istanbul in two
planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was
there and later left the country, a Turkish security source told
Reuters.

    SAUDI VERSION
    Saudi Arabia had until now strenuously denied that Khashoggi
had died in the consulate. 
    But the Saudi public prosecutor said on Saturday that a
fight broke out between Khashoggi and people who met him in the
building, leading to his death. Eighteen Saudi nationals had
been arrested, the prosecutor said. 
    A Saudi official told Reuters separately: ""A group of Saudis
had a physical altercation and Jamal died as a result of the
chokehold. They were trying to keep him quiet.""
    Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, tweeted in
Arabic: ""They have taken your body from this world, but your
beautiful smile will stay in my world forever.""
    Saudi state media said King Salman had ordered the dismissal
of five officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court
adviser seen as the right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, and
deputy intelligence chief Ahmed Asiri.
    The crisis prompted the king to intervene, five sources with
links to the Saudi royal family told Reuters. [nL8N1WW5RF]
    The king also ordered a restructuring of the intelligence
service, to be led by Prince Mohammed, suggesting the prince
still retained wide-ranging authority.
    Saudi Arabia's regional allies - including Egypt, Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates - issued statements in praise of
the king.
    The dismissed official Qahtani, 40, rose to prominence after
latching onto Prince Mohammed, becoming a rare confidant in his
inner circle.
    Sources say Qahtani would regularly speak on behalf of the
crown prince and has given direct orders to senior officials
including in the security apparatus.
    The New York Times reported on Saturday, citing U.S. and
Saudi officials, that Qahtani created the strategy behind the
deployment an online army to harass Khashoggi and other critics
of the kingdom on Twitter. [nL2N1X00AC]
    People close to Khashoggi and the government said Qahtani
had tried to lure the journalist back to Saudi Arabia after he
moved to Washington a year ago fearing reprisals for his views.
    Asiri joined the Saudi military in 2002, according to Saudi
media reports, serving as spokesman for a coalition backing
Yemen's ousted president after Prince Mohammed took Saudi Arabia
into that country's civil war in 2015. He was named deputy chief
of foreign intelligence in 2017.    
    A Saudi official familiar with the Saudi investigation said
the crown prince had no knowledge of the specific operation that
resulted in Khashoggi's death, 
    ""There were no orders for them to kill him or even
specifically kidnap him,"" said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. There was a standing order to bring
critics of the kingdom back to the country, he added.

    LATEST SAUDI VERSION
    As Saudi Arabia faced intensifying international scepticism
over its story, a senior Saudi official laid out a new version
of the death in which a team of 15 Saudi nationals sent to
confront Khashoggi had threatened him with being drugged and
kidnapped and then killed him in a chokehold when he resisted. A
member of the team then dressed in Khashoggi's clothes to make
it appear as if he had left the consulate. [nL8N1X00YX]
    French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a full
investigation into the killing and German Chancellor Angela

    ""We expect transparency from Saudi Arabia about the

    German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called into question the
sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. [nL8N1X00SH] 
    Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Riyadh's
explanations lacked consistency and credibility. 
    Trump said it was possible that Prince Mohammed had been
unaware of the circumstances around the death of Khashoggi, 59. 
    For Western allies, a main question will be whether they
believe that the prince, who has painted himself as a reformer,

running of Saudi Arabia to him.
    Trump, who has forged close ties with Saudi Arabia and the
crown prince, said he was concerned that it was unclear where
the journalist's body is.    
    
    SEARCH FOR BODY
    According to the senior Saudi official, the Saudi team
rolled up Khashoggi's body in a rug, took it out in a consular
vehicle and handed it to a ""local cooperator"" for disposal.
    One of the operatives then donned Khashoggi's clothes,
eyeglasses and Apple watch and left through the back door of the
consulate in an attempt to make it look like Khashoggi had
walked out of the building, the senior Saudi official said.
    Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened
to the corpse ""before long"", a senior Turkish official said
earlier on Saturday. [nL8N1X00CN]
    Officials told Reuters in Turkey on Thursday that
Khashoggi's remains may have been dumped in Belgrad Forest
adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of
Yalova, 90 km (55 miles) south of Istanbul,     
    Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording
purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate.
Pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, citing the audio,
said his torturers cut off his fingers during an interrogation
and later beheaded him.
    Trump said no one from his administration has seen video or
a transcript of what happened inside the consulate.
    Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, tweeted in
Arabic: ""They have taken your body from this world, but your
beautiful smile will stay in my world forever.""            
    Saudi Arabia had previously denied that Khashoggi died in
the consulate. 
    But the Saudi public prosecutor said on Saturday that a
fight broke out between Khashoggi and people who met him in the
building, leading to his death. Eighteen Saudi nationals had
been arrested, the prosecutor said.
    Saudi state media said King Salman had ordered the dismissal
of five officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court
adviser seen as the right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, and
deputy intelligence chief Ahmed Asiri.
    The crisis prompted the king to intervene, five sources with
links to the Saudi royal family told Reuters. [nL8N1WW5RF]
    The king also ordered a restructuring of the intelligence
service, to be led by Prince Mohammed, suggesting the prince
still retained wide-ranging authority.
    The dismissed official Qahtani, 40, rose to prominence after
latching onto Prince Mohammed, becoming a rare confidant in his
inner circle.
    Sources say Qahtani would regularly speak on behalf of the
crown prince and has given direct orders to senior officials
including in the security apparatus.
    The New York Times reported on Saturday, citing U.S. and
Saudi officials, that Qahtani created the strategy behind the
deployment an online army to harass Khashoggi and other critics
of the kingdom on Twitter. [nL2N1X00AC]
    People close to Khashoggi and the government said Qahtani
had tried to lure the journalist back to Saudi Arabia after he
moved to Washington a year ago fearing reprisals for his views.
    Asiri joined the Saudi military in 2002, according to Saudi
media reports, serving as spokesman for a coalition backing
Yemen's ousted president after Prince Mohammed took Saudi Arabia
into that country's civil war in 2015. He was named deputy chief
of foreign intelligence in 2017.

    Talks between Britain and the EU have stalled over a

    ""We would accept a potential extension by a few months

an indefinite customs union and a limbo period,"" Braverman told

    * German foreign min says cancellations send right signal
    * Kaeser has not made up his mind - Siemens spokesman

    BERLIN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Siemens <SIEGn.DE> boss Joe
Kaeser came under pressure from senior German politicians on
Sunday to pull out of an investment conference in Saudi Arabia
next week following Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death.
    Many business executives including the heads of Deutsche
Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Uber Technologies and Siemens rival ABB
<ABBN.S> have dropped out of Riyadh's Future Investment
Initiative conference amid outrage about Khashoggi's fate.
    The leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), Andrea Nahles,
called on Kaeser to follow the example of other executives and
cancel his plans to attend the conference.
    ""I hope that Joe Kaeser will rethink this,"" she told the
Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
    Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, also from the SPD, told German
public television on Saturday evening that cancellations sent
the right signal.
    ""I certainly wouldn't participate in an event in Riyadh at
the moment,"" he said. ""And I have great understanding for those
who have cancelled."" [nL8N1X00R9]
    Norbert Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Christian Democratic Union who chairs the German parliamentary
foreign affairs committee, also urged Kaeser to skip the event.
    ""This applies in my view, for example, to the Siemens CEO
who has confirmed his attendance,"" he told the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper.
    A spokesman for Siemens said Kaeser had not yet decided
whether to attend the conference. He said he expected Kaeser to
make a decision on Sunday.
    The engineering conglomerate has won orders to supply gas
turbines, power plant components and trains to Saudi Arabia.
Last year, it signed a declaration of intent to work with Saudi
authorities to equip infrastructure projects which Siemens said
could be worth at least a billion euros.
    Merkel and Maas have reacted strongly to Saudi Arabia's
admission that Khashoggi died in the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul, condemning the killing and demanding Riyadh make clear
what happened.

    * European governments have been more forceful
    * Saudi official lays out new account of killing

    By Lesley Wroughton and Marwa Rashad
    JERUSALEM/RIYADH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's
explanation of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a
""good first step but not enough"", the U.S. Treasury secretary
said on Sunday, adding it was premature to discuss sanctions
against Riyadh over the incident.
    The comments from Steven Mnuchin are the latest from the
administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that appear aimed
at censuring a killing that has sparked global outrage while
protecting relations with the world's top oil exporter.
    European governments have been more forceful in dismissing
Riyadh's explanation that Khashoggi died following a fistfight
in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. On Sunday,
Britain's Brexit minister said the account was not credible.
    ""It would be premature to comment on sanctions and premature
to comment on really any issues until we get further down the
investigation and get to the bottom of what occurred,"" Mnuchin
told reporters in Jerusalem.
    He confirmed he would not attend a Saudi investment
conference on Tuesday. However, he said he would visit Riyadh as
planned for talks with his counterpart there on joint efforts to
counter terrorist financing and plans by Washington to reimpose
sanctions against Iran in November.
    After denying any involvement in the disappearance of
Khashoggi, 59, for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said the
journalist and critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had
died in a fistfight at the consulate. An hour later, another
Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold.
    Reflecting the intensifying international scepticism over
its account, a senior Saudi government official has laid out a
new version that in key respects contradicts previous
explanations. [nL8N1X108Q]
    The latest account includes details on how the team of 15
Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi had threatened him
with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed him in a
chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team then dressed in
Khashoggi's clothes to make it appear as if he had left the
consulate.
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a Saudi national and
U.S. resident, was killed inside the consulate by a team of
Saudi agents and his body cut up.
    Trump's comments about the Khashoggi incident in recent days
have ranged from threatening Saudi Arabia with ""very severe""
consequences and warning of economic sanctions, to more
conciliatory remarks in which he has played up the country's
role as a U.S. ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well
as a major purchaser of U.S. arms.
    ""I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a
big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to
the answer,"" Trump told reporters this weekend, when asked about
the Saudi investigation and the subsequent firing of Saudi
officials over the incident.
    In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said that
""obviously there's been deception, and there's been lies"".
    
    SHIFTING NARRATIVE
    Saudi Arabia's account of the incident has changed multiple
times. The authorities initially dismissed reports that
Khashoggi had gone missing inside the consulate as false and
said he had left the building soon after entering. When the
media reported a few days later that he had been killed there,
they called the accusations ""baseless"".
    Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, said the
explanation that Khashoggi had died after a fistfight was not
believable. 
    ""No, I don't think it is credible,"" he said in an interview
on BBC TV. 
    For Western allies, a main question will be whether they
believe that the prince, who has painted himself as a reformer,
has any culpability. King Salman, 82, had handed the day-to-day
running of Saudi Arabia to him.
    Trump has forged close ties with Saudi Arabia and the crown
prince, citing the kingdom's economic importance and its role in
countering the influence of rival Iran in the region.
    French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Saudi Arabia's
admission that Khashoggi had been killed was welcome ""progress"",
but urged the kingdom to follow through with a full and
transparent investigation.
    ""I note that the Saudi authorities have changed tack,
admitted the facts and accepted some responsibility, so we're
making progress,"" Le Maire said on France 3 television. ""But
full light needs to be shed.""
    Some governments and prominent executives have said they
would pull out of an upcoming investment conference in Saudi
Arabia. Among the latest, the government of New Zealand said it
would not attend, as did the head of the main banking unit of
Japanese financial group MUFG.
    
    SEARCH FOR BODY
    According to the senior Saudi official, the Saudi team
rolled up Khashoggi's body in a rug, took it out in a consular
vehicle and handed it to a ""local cooperator"" for disposal.
    One of the operatives then donned Khashoggi's clothes,
eyeglasses and Apple watch and left through the back door of the
consulate to make it look like Khashoggi had walked out of the
building, the senior Saudi official said.
    Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened
to the corpse ""before long"", a senior Turkish official said on
Saturday. 
    Officials told Reuters in Turkey on Thursday that
Khashoggi's remains may have been dumped in Belgrad Forest
adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of
Yalova, 90 km (55 miles) south of Istanbul.
    Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording
purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate.
    Pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, citing the
audio, said his torturers cut off his fingers during an
interrogation and later beheaded him.
    Trump said no one from his administration had seen video or
a transcript of what happened inside the consulate.

    JERUSALEM/RIYADH, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's
explanation of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a
""good first step but not enough"", the U.S. Treasury secretary
said on Sunday, adding it was premature to discuss any sanctions
against Riyadh over the incident.
    The comments from Steven Mnuchin are the latest from the
administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that appear aimed
at censuring a killing that has sparked global outrage while
protecting relations with the world's top oil exporter.
    European governments, as well as some lawmakers in Trump's
own Republican party, have been more forceful in dismissing
Riyadh's explanation that Khashoggi died following a fistfight
in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. On Sunday,
Britain's Brexit minister said that account was not credible.
    ""It would be premature to comment on sanctions and premature
to comment on really any issues until we get further down the
investigation and get to the bottom of what occurred,"" Mnuchin
told reporters in Jerusalem.
    While Mnuchin said he would not attend a Saudi investment
conference on Tuesday, he will still visit Riyadh as planned for
talks with his counterpart there on joint efforts to counter
terrorist financing and plans by Washington to reimpose
sanctions against Iran in November.
    Khashoggi, a Saudi national and U.S. resident, went missing
after entering the consulate to obtain documents for his
upcoming marriage. After denying any involvement in the
59-year-old's disappearance for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on
Saturday said the prominent journalist and critic of Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman had died during a fight in the
building. An hour later, another Saudi official attributed the
death to a chokehold.
    Reflecting the intensifying international scepticism over
its account, a senior Saudi government official has laid out a
new version that in key respects contradicts previous
explanations. [nL8N1X108Q]
    The latest account includes details on how the team of 15
Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi had threatened him
with being drugged and kidnapped and killed him in a chokehold
when he resisted. A member of the team dressed in Khashoggi's
clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate.
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a Washington Post
columnist, was killed inside the consulate by the team of Saudi
agents and his body cut up.
    Trump's comments about the incident in recent days have
ranged from threatening Riyadh with ""very severe"" consequences
and warning of economic sanctions, to conciliatory remarks
emphasising the kingdom's role as an ally against Iran and
Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms.
    ""I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a
big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to
the answer,"" Trump told reporters this weekend, when asked about
the Saudi investigation and Riyadh's subsequent firing of Saudi
officials over the incident.
    In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said that
""obviously there's been deception, and there's been lies"".
    
    SHIFTING NARRATIVE
    For Saudi Arabia's allies - particularly in the West - the
question will be whether they believe that the prince, who has
painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman,
82, had handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him.
    A leading Republican U.S. senator said he believed the crown
prince was behind the killing, adding that the Saudis had lost
all credibility in their explanations of his death.
    ""Yes, I think he did it,"" Senator Bob Corker, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview
with CNN. [nL2N1X105B]
    Saudi Arabia's account of the incident has changed multiple
times. The authorities initially dismissed reports that
Khashoggi had gone missing inside the consulate as false and
said he had left the building soon after entering. When the
media reported a few days later that he had been killed there,
they called the accusations ""baseless"".
    Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, said the
explanation that Khashoggi had died after a fistfight was not
believable. 
    ""No, I don't think it is credible,"" he told BBC TV. 
    King Salman ordered the dismissal of five officials,
including Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court adviser seen as the
right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, and deputy intelligence chief
Ahmed Asiri, Saudi state media reported on Saturday.
    Eighteen Saudi nationals had been arrested, the Saudi public
prosecutor said in a statement. 
    The king also ordered a restructuring of the intelligence
service, to be led by Prince Mohammed, suggesting the prince
still retained wide-ranging authority.
    French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Saudi Arabia's
admission that Khashoggi had been killed was welcome ""progress"",
but urged the kingdom to follow through with a full and
transparent investigation.
    ""I note that the Saudi authorities have changed tack,
admitted the facts and accepted some responsibility, so we're
making progress,"" Le Maire said on France 3 television. ""But
full light needs to be shed.""
    Some governments and prominent executives have said they
would pull out of an upcoming investment conference in Saudi
Arabia. Among the latest, the government of New Zealand said it
would not attend, as did the head of the main banking unit of
Japanese financial group MUFG.
    
    SEARCH FOR BODY
    According to the senior Saudi official, the Saudi team
rolled up Khashoggi's body in a rug, took it out in a consular
vehicle and handed it to a ""local cooperator"" for disposal.
    One of the operatives then donned Khashoggi's clothes,
eyeglasses and Apple watch and left through the back door of the
consulate to make it look like Khashoggi had walked out of the
building, the senior Saudi official said.
    Turkish investigators are likely to find out what happened
to the corpse ""before long"", a senior Turkish official said on
Saturday. 
    Officials told Reuters in Turkey on Thursday that
Khashoggi's remains may have been dumped in Belgrad Forest
adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of
Yalova, 90 km (55 miles) south of Istanbul.
    Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording
purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate.
    Pro-government Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, citing the
audio, said his torturers cut off his fingers during an
interrogation and later beheaded him.
    Trump said no one from his administration had seen video or
a transcript of what happened inside the consulate.

    By Doina Chiacu and Kylie MacLellan
    WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Sunday
called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul
consulate a ""huge and grave mistake"", but sought to shield its
powerful crown prince from the widening crisis, saying Mohammed
bin Salman had not been aware.
    The comments from Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir were some
of the most direct yet from Riyadh, which has given multiple and
conflicting accounts about Khashoggi's killing on Oct.2, first
denying his death before admitting it on Saturday amid an
international outcry.
    The kingdom's weeks of denial and lack of credible evidence
in the face of allegations from Turkish officals that Khashoggi
had been killed have shaken global confidence in ties with the
world's top oil exporter, Western governments say.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said on Sunday that
Saudi Arabia's admission that the Washington Post columnist had
been killed in a fistfight was a ""good first step but not
enough"", though he added it was premature to discuss any
sanctions against Riyadh.
    Three major European powers - Germany, Britain and France -
pressed Saudi Arabia to provide facts to back up its earlier
explanation of a fight, while Chancellor Angela Merkel said
Germany would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while the current
uncertainty over Khashoggi's fate persisted. [nS8N1TF01R]
    Speaking to U.S. broadcaster Fox, Jubeir, the Saudi foreign
minister, extended condolences to Khashoggi's family.
    ""This is a terrible mistake. This is a terrible tragedy. Our
condolences go out to them. We feel their pain,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, a huge and grave mistake was made and I assure
them that those responsible will be held accountable for this.""
    He said the Saudis did not know how Khashoggi, a Saudi
national and U.S. resident, had been killed or where his body
was. He also said that Prince Mohammed, defacto ruler of Saudi
Arabia, was not responsible.
    ""This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding
the authorities and responsibilities they had.  They made the
mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and
they tried to cover up for it.""  
    Khashoggi went missing after entering the consulate to
obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. 
    After denying any involvement in the 59-year-old's
disappearance for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said
Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, had died during a fight
in the building. An hour later, another Saudi official
attributed the death to a chokehold.
    ""Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the
strongest possible terms,"" Germany, Britain and France said in
their joint statement on Sunday. 
    ""There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly
what happened ... beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so
far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts
to be considered credible.""
    Reflecting international scepticism over its account, a
senior Saudi government official has laid out a new version that
in key respects contradicts previous explanations. [nL8N1X108Q]
    The latest account includes details on how the team of 15

    ERDOGAN TO SPEAK
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed inside the
consulate by the team of Saudi agents and his body cut up.
Turkish sources say the authorities have an audio recording
purportedly documenting Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate.
    In a speech on Sunday, Erdogan appeared to suggest that he
was getting ready to release some information about the Turkish
investigation, and would do so at his weekly speech to members
of his ruling AK Party in parliament.
    He has remained largely silent on the case, although
Turkey's pro-government newspapers have released information
detailing a 15-member team that purportedly arrived in Istanbul
to confront Khashoggi at the consulate.
    ""I will make my statements about this issue on Tuesday at
the party group meeting,"" Erdogan said. 
    For Saudi Arabia's allies - particularly in the West - the
question will be whether they believe that the prince, who has
painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman,
82, had handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him.

 (Recasts with exit polls)
    By Alicja Ptak and Joanna Plucinska
    WARSAW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Poland's ruling Law and Justice
(PiS) party scored modest gains in regional government in
Sunday's election, an exit poll showed, a result likely to
embolden the eurosceptic PiS in its conflict with the European
Union over democratic standards.
    PiS swept into power in 2015 on a promise of voter-pleasing
welfare reforms, social conservatism and a bigger state role in
the economy. It remains broadly popular, despite accusations at
home and abroad of a shift towards authoritarian rule.
    The party won some 32.3 percent of votes for provincial
assemblies, compared with 26.9 percent in a vote four years
earlier. A coalition of centrist opposition parties was set to
win some 24.7 percent, the poll by Ipsos pollster showed.
    ""This result bodes well for the parliamentary election,"" PiS
leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said after the exit poll was released.
    In the closely-watched race for mayor of the capital Warsaw,
however, the PiS candidate, Patryk Jaki, 33, came in second
place after Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, a pro-EU centrist.
    Final results of the election will be released by the
electoral commission by the middle of the week. 
    The election is part of a larger battle over Europe's
future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban - who like PiS
believes the EU's powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc
and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
    While exit poll results can not give a clear indication of
how many of Poland's 16 provincial assemblies will fall under
PiS control, any gains will mean better access to local funding.
That could affect a general election in 2019. 
    ""I don't believe in a liberal democracy, because it leads to
anarchy,"" said Stanisław Lawniczak, 68, a real estate manager
who voted for PiS candidates in Warsaw.

 (Adds comments, context)
    By Marcin Goclowski and Agnieszka Barteczko
    WARSAW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Poland's ruling eurosceptic Law
and Justice (PiS) scored limited gains in regional government in
Sunday's election, but lost a high-profile race for Warsaw
mayor, an exit poll showed, laying bare divisions in Poland over
the party's democracy record.
    Since sweeping into power in 2015, PiS has remained broadly
popular, benefiting from voter-pleasing welfare reforms,
nationalist rhetoric and strong economic growth. 
    But critics at home and abroad have accused it of a tilt
towards authoritarian rule after moves to increase government
control over the judiciary and public media that have also
fuelled Poland's isolation within the European Union.
    The party won some 32.3 percent of votes for provincial
assemblies, compared with 26.9 percent in a vote four years
earlier and 37.6 percent it scored in the 2015 parliamentary
election. A coalition of centrist opposition parties was set to
win some 24.7 percent, an opinion poll by Ipsos showed.
    A strong showing for the agrarian PSL party, which was on
track to win 16.6 percent on Sunday, was a blow for PiS which
had focused much of its election campaign on winning the rural
vote.
    In Warsaw, however, the PiS candidate, Patryk Jaki, 33, came
in second place after Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, a pro-EU centrist,
who unexpectedly secured the office in a first round of voting
by winning more than 50 percent of votes.
    If confirmed, the results will mean PiS could struggle to
keep its support base during a parliamentary election in late
2019 and a presidential vote a year later.
    PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said the party's showing on
Sunday bodes well for next year, but he added: ""We have to work,
work, and work some more."" PiS leader told party activists after
exit polls came out: ""The election campaign is starting.""
    Final results of the election will be released by the
electoral commission by the middle of the week. 
    The election is part of a larger battle over Europe's
future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban - who like PiS
believes the EU's powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc
and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
    With Brussels entering campaign mode ahead of a European
Parliament election in May, the Polish vote could give some
hints on whether eurosceptic groups can secure a stronger voice
and thwart further EU integration.
    ""I'd say its a tie, with some advantage for the opposition,""
said Warsaw University political scientist Rafal Chwedoruk of
the Polish vote.    
    
    QUESTIONS OVER LIBERAL DEMOCRACY
    While exit poll results can not give a clear indication of
how many of Poland's 16 provincial assemblies will fall under
PiS control, any gains will mean better access to local funding.
That could affect a general election in 2019. Since the 2014
election, PiS only controls one such assembly.
    ""I don't believe in a liberal democracy, because it leads to
anarchy,"" said Stanisław Lawniczak, 68, a real estate manager
who voted for PiS candidates in Warsaw. 
    The turnout in the election topped 50 percent and was the
highest in a regional vote since Poland overthrew communism in
1989, an indication of deep-running divisions that may have
galvanised voters.
    Winning Warsaw, a bastion of anti-government protests since
2015, was seen as the top prize in the election, with PiS' Jaki
vowing city hall under his leadership would side with ordinary
people against what he calls arrogant, liberal elites.
    A long-time EU emissary for the centrist Civic Platform
party, Trzaskowski had promised the capital would remain ""open,
tolerant and European"".
    ""I hope the victory in Warsaw is the first step and that we
will win upcoming votes. It's important for Poland that
politicians who respect the rule of law have access to power,""
Trzaskowski said after exit polls came out.
    Underlining divisions, the EU's top court ordered the Warsaw
government on Friday to suspend an overhaul of the Supreme Court
and reinstate judges forced into early retirement.
    The moves were part of broader reforms of the judiciary,
which PiS says are crucial to making the system more fair and
efficient, but opponents say they are an attack on democratic
checks and balances.

    By Doina Chiacu and Kylie MacLellan
    WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Sunday
called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul
consulate a ""huge and grave mistake,"" but sought to shield its
powerful crown prince from the widening crisis, saying Mohammed
bin Salman had not been aware.
    The comments from Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir were some
of the most direct yet from Riyadh, which has given multiple and
conflicting accounts about Khashoggi's killing on Oct. 2, first
denying his death and later admitting it amid an international
outcry.
    The weeks of denial and lack of credible evidence in the
face of allegations from Turkish officials that Khashoggi had
been killed have shaken global confidence in ties with the
world's top oil exporter.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said Saudi Arabia's
admission that the Washington Post columnist was killed in a
fistfight was a ""good first step but not enough,"" though he
added it was premature to discuss sanctions against Riyadh.
    Three European powers - Germany, Britain and France -
pressed Riyadh to provide facts, and Chancellor Angela Merkel
said Germany would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while
uncertainty over Khashoggi's fate persisted. [nS8N1TF01R]
    Late on Sunday, the Saudi Press Agency said both Saudi King
Salman and Prince Mohammed had called Khashoggi's son, Salah, to
express condolences.
    Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, had extended condolences
to Khashoggi's family earlier on Sunday.
    ""This is a terrible mistake. This is a terrible tragedy. Our
condolences go out to them. We feel their pain,"" Jubeir told the
U.S. broacaster Fox. ""Unfortunately, a huge and grave mistake
was made and I assure them that those responsible will be held
accountable for this.""
    He said the Saudis did not know how Khashoggi, a Saudi
national and U.S. resident, had been killed or where his body
was. He also said Prince Mohammed was not responsible.
    ""This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding
the authorities and responsibilities they had. They made the
mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and
they tried to cover up for it.""  
    Khashoggi vanished after entering the consulate to obtain
documents for his upcoming marriage. 
    After two weeks denying any involvement in the 59-year-old's
disappearance, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said Khashoggi, a critic
of the crown prince, died during a fight in the building. An
hour later, another Saudi official attributed the death to a
chokehold.
    ""Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the
strongest possible terms,"" Germany, Britain and France said in
their joint statement. 
    ""There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly
what happened ... beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so
far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts
to be considered credible.""
    Reflecting international scepticism over its account, a
senior Saudi government official laid out a new version that
contradicts previous explanations. [nL8N1X108Q]
    The latest account includes details on how 15 Saudis sent to
confront Khashoggi had threatened him with being drugged and
kidnapped and killed him in a chokehold when he resisted. A
member of the team dressed in Khashoggi's clothes to make it
appear as if he had left the consulate.
    
    ERDOGAN TO SPEAK
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed inside the
consulate by the Saudi agents and his body cut up. Turkish
sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly
documenting Khashoggi's murder.
    In a speech on Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan appeared to suggest he was getting ready to release some
information about the Turkish investigation, and would do so at
his weekly speech to members of his ruling AK Party in
parliament.
    Erdogan has remained largely silent on the case, although
Turkey's pro-government newspapers have released information
about events at the consulate.
    ""I will make my statements about this issue on Tuesday at
the party group meeting,"" Erdogan said.
    Turkey's Anadolu agency said early on Monday that Erdogan
and U.S. President Donald Trump had spoken on the telephone and
agreed that ""all aspects"" of the case needed to be cleared up.
    For Saudi Arabia's allies - particularly in the West - the
question will be whether they believe that the prince, who has
painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman,
82, has handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him.
    ""I am not satisfied until we find the answer. But it was a
big first step, it was a good first step. But I want to get to
the answer,"" Trump told reporters this weekend, when asked about
the Saudi investigation and Riyadh's firing of officials over
the incident.
    In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said that
""obviously there's been deception, and there's been lies.""
    A leading Republican U.S. senator said he believed the crown
prince was behind the killing, adding that the Saudis had lost
all credibility in their explanations of his death. ""Yes, I
think he did it,"" Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, told CNN, referring to the crown prince.
[nL2N1X105B]
    King Salman ordered the dismissal of five officials,
including Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court adviser seen as the
right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, and deputy intelligence chief
Ahmed Asiri, Saudi state media reported on Saturday.
    The king also ordered a restructuring of the intelligence
service, to be led by Prince Mohammed, suggesting the prince
still retained wide-ranging authority.
    Some governments and prominent executives have said they
would pull out of a forthcoming investment conference in Saudi
Arabia. Among the latest, the government of New Zealand said it
would not attend, as did the head of the main banking unit of
Japanese financial group MUFG.
    According to the senior Saudi official, the Saudi team
rolled up Khashoggi's body in a rug, took it out in a consular
vehicle and handed it to a ""local cooperator"" for disposal.

    * Most investors think Italian budget standoff contained
    * But euro may be more closely linked to politics than
understood 
    * Euro and BTP/bund spread inverse correlation as high as 87
pct

    By Tommy Wilkes and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The formation of Italy's
anti-establishment government and its intensifying row with
European Union authorities have lifted correlations between the
country's bonds and the euro to the highest since 2013. 
    That could be read as a sign of stress, namely worries that
Italy's woes would threaten the single currency. But lack of
contagion in other euro bond markets suggests otherwise, and
some reckon it may reflect expectations of European Central Bank
policy action should the dispute over Italy's budget escalate.
    Italian borrowing costs have surged to the highest since
early 2014, while the gap between 10-year German and Italian
government bonds - known as the Bund/BTP spread and a key
measure of Italian risk -- is also at its highest in more than
five years <IT10DE10=RR>
    But unlike the 2010-2012 Greek crisis, there has been little
spillover into other euro zone bond markets. Instead, it is the
euro that is feeling the blowback, approaching 15-month lows
<EUR=EBS> [L8N1WS26W].
    It has lost 6.6 percent versus the dollar since Italy's
early-March election that returned two parties once keen on a
return to the lira.
    Some of that is probably down to the dollar's rally, fuelled
by a strengthening U.S. economy. But there is also evidence that
the inverse correlation between the euro/dollar rate and the
BTP/Bund spread has strengthened considerably this year, meaning
the euro weakened each time the spread widened, as the following
chart shows:
   
    The inverse correlation, based on a 130-day period, rose to
87 percent at the end of August. In January, correlation was
near zero, Reuters analysis shows. Currently it stands at 84
percent.
    Correlations were previously this negative in late-2012/
early-2013, just after ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do
""whatever it takes"" to save the single currency.
    The inverse correlation clearly reflects concern that
populist politicians will pursue fiscally unsustainable policies
that euro zone authorities can do little to stop.
    But markets also clearly retain faith in Draghi's promise,
with bets growing he will act if the Italian situation worsens.
That in itself makes the current bubbling crisis different from
2012 in that the bloc's existence is not seen at risk.
    ""There is a view which is not really consensus yet, but
there is momentum towards the view that the ECB will probably
adopt a more dovish exit than what has been priced, as a result
of Italy and also because of expansion not being that strong,""
said Shweta Singh, senior economist at TS Lombard.
    So each time the Italian situation appears to worsen and
spreads widen, bets grow on ECB action, possibly by delaying
rate rises, currently expected next September. 
    On Friday, after the EU called the Italian draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of fiscal rules, the euro dipped to as
low as $1.1433 and the BTP/Bund spread widened to a fresh 5
1/2-year high [nL8N1WY213] [nL8N1WZ16J].
    Money markets, meanwhile, cut their bets on a September 2019
rate rise by the ECB. Bets have instead been pushed back to next
October.

    BUDGET PLANS
    Romania's government is considering a series of measures to
reduce spending ahead of drafting its budget plan for 2019,
including freezing public sector wages at their 2018 levels and
capping tax contributions to a mandatory private pension scheme,
a document sent to the European Commission showed.
    Senate speaker and the head of junior ruling coalition party

the measure would heighten emigration. www.profit.ro
    
    MINIMUM WAGE

    WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR: EUROPE SET TO SNAP 3-DAY LOSING STREAK (0651 GMT)
    European shares are expected to snap a three-day losing streak at the open today, helped by
deal-making activity and after Moody's kept its outlook on Italy at stable on Friday, while some
downbeat earning updates could weigh. Euro STOXX 50 futures are up 0.8 percent.
    Trade-hit automakers will be in focus after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli
unit for 6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hurt last week by Daimler's profit warning,
could find support after Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the threat of air
pollution leading to driving bans. [nL3N1X229D] [nL8N1X10X0]
    Italian banks could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after Moody's kept
the Italy's sovereign ratings outlook stable while delivering an expected downgrade on Friday.
    In earnings, eyes on Ryanair after it posted a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warned
that European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter, while Philips saw its profit
rising less than expected, due to currency headwinds. [nS8N1WP004] [nL8N1X20NQ]
    This week 22 percent of the STOXX 600's market will have reported results. European earnings
are seen up 13.6 percent in the third quarter, while euro zone earnings are seen up 11.7
percent. US earnings are expected to rise more than 22 percent.

car maker agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli unit for $7.1 billion, while in results, Ryanair
<RYA.I> could be under pressure after posting a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warning
European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter. Also in focus is Philips <PHG.AS>
after its profit rose less than expected.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN SHARES SEEN SLIGHTLY UP (0525 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open slightly higher today as earning updates continue to
roll in and investors await for further developments in Brexit negotiations following a big
march in London over the weekend to demand a second vote [nL8N1X00FF]. Eyes are also on Italy's
budget discussions following Moody's downgrade on Friday [nL3N1WZ5VO].
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 19 points higher at 7,046, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 15 points lower at 11,574 and Paris' CAC to open 3 points lower at 5,113. 
    Over in Asia, shares pared early losses as Chinese stocks swung higher for a second session
on Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. That helped offset geopolitical
concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit. [nL3N1X203D]

Union member states to follow its example in stopping arms
exports to Saudi Arabia as long as uncertainty remains over the
killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Economy Minister Peter
Altmaier said on Monday.
    Riyadh has given multiple and conflicting accounts on what
led to Khashoggi's death on Oct. 2 at its consulate in Istanbul.
On Sunday, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir called the killing a
""huge and grave mistake"" but sought to shield Saudi Arabia's
powerful crown prince. [nL8N1X10M8]
    Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday that Germany would
stop arms exports to Saudi Arabia as long as the uncertainty
around Khashoggi's death persisted. [nS8N1TF01R]
     Altmaier, a close ally of Merkel, said Riyadh's
explanations on the case so far had not been satisfactory.
    ""The government is in agreement that we will not approve
further arms exports for the moment because we want to know what
happened,"" Altmaier told ZDF broadcaster.
    So far this year the German government had approved weapons
exports worth more than 400 million euros ($462 million) to
Saudi Arabia, making it the second-biggest recipient of German
arms after Algeria.
    Asked whether Germany would roll back previously agreed arms
deals with Saudi, he said a decision would be made ""very soon"".
    Altmaier said other EU states should stop arms exports to
Saudi Arabia in order to increase pressure on Riyadh over the
Khashoggi case. 
    ""For me it would be important that we come to a joint
European stance,"" Altmaier said.
    ""Because only if all European countries are in agreement, it
will make an impression on the government in Riyadh. It will not
have any positive consequences if we halt arms exports but other
countries at the same time fill the gap.""
    Senior German politicians have also urged Siemens [SIEGn.DE]
CEO Joe Kaeser over the weekend to pull out of an investment
conference in Saudi Arabia later this week. [nL8N1X10HA]

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Preliminary results in Poland's
weekend local elections are coming through today, but already it
looks like a less-than- resounding victory for the ruling Law
and Justice (PiS) party. Notably they failed to carry off the
main prize of Warsaw and lost in other urban areas, where
scepticism about the PiS brand of socially conservative,
autocratic rule is highest. It is too early to make predictions
about what this means for next year's parliamentary elections,
but a similar result could allow opposition parties to band
together and defeat PiS.
    Whether the presence on Saturday of some 700,000 people on
the streets of London calling for a fresh vote on Brexit will
influence events remains to be seen, but in the meantime its
business as usual on the impasse story. UK Brexit negotiator
Dominic Raab's suggestion that he could accept an extension of
the post-Brexit transition period, but only if the Irish
backstop was dropped. That was been promptly shot down by
Dublin; it was always unlikely that the EU side would back down
from a key part of its negotiating stance so cheaply. Today PM
Theresa May will attempt to quell some of the mounting domestic
criticism of her handling of the talks by telling parliament
that the deal is 95 percent done.
    Perhaps with a view to pre-empting the market impact of
negative news, Italian sources said at the weekend they expect
the European Commission to reject Rome's 2019 budget as early as
Tuesday. In the meantime, Italian bonds have perked up on the
back of 5-Star leader Luigi di Maio's assurance that Italy wants
to remain in the euro and the relief that Moody's at least kept
its outlook on Italian debt stable despite an expected downgrade
of its sovereign rating to Baa3 on Friday.

MARKETS 7.55 A.M.   
Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of
stock market support saw Chinese shares stage their biggest
one-day surge in almost three years, while 10-year Italian
borrowing costs recorded their biggest one-day plunge since June
after Moody’s credit firm on Friday downgraded Italy’s sovereign
rating to the final rung of investment grade but revised its
outlook to stable from negative. The two influences brightened
the increasingly gloomy mood on world markets rattled by the
Sino-U.S. trade war, rising U.S. interest rates, Italy’s
standoff and messy Brexit negotiations. With the current
corporate earnings season also chiming in as a positive so far,
stock markets around the world have bounced back modestly after
last week’s steep losses. While the Shanghai-Shenzhen CSI300
benchmark climbed more than 4 percent – its biggest daily jump
since November 2015 – and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose more than 2
percent, gains in Tokyo and Seoul were a more restrained 0.3
percent. U.S. and European stock futures were up about 0.4
percent. MSCI’s all-country world stock market index was up 0.2
percent after losses of almost 4 percent last week, its worst
week since March. 
    In Italy, Moody’s decision to move the sovereign ratings to
stable eased outside fears of another imminent cut of the rating
to ""junk"" status and stoked hopes S&P would do likewise when it
reviews the credit this Friday coming. The sharp 25-basis-point
drop in 10-year Italian yields and some 40-basis-point retreat
in two-year yields also reflects the degree of speculative
positioning in that market at the end of last week. Moody’s said
its decision to downgrade Italy was because the new government’s
controversial budget was only likely to stabilise the country’s
debt-to-GDP ratio rather than set it on a downward path as
promised with European Union monitors, leaving the country’s
budget math and debt sustainability more open to a surprise
domestic or global growth shock. Although the European
Commission is expected to ask Rome to re-draft the budget, it’s
not clear yet whether it will enact its ""excessive deficit
procedure"" that could lead to penalties on Rome. EU commissioner
Pierre Moscovici said a period of dialogue was not necessary. So
far, the government insists it can convince Brussels of the
merits of its plans. Deputy PM Di Maio said on Monday the
government was ready to discuss the plans, was mindful of recent
bond market moves and had no intention of leaving the euro. 
    With one eye on this week’s European Central Bank meeting,
the bond market rally in Italy helped the euro/dollar exchange
rate higher first thing Monday. The dollar was a touch easier
more broadly, with the yen underperforming as world stock
markets rallied. Sterling was steady after failure to reach a
Brexit agreement at last week EU summit has shifted attention
back onto UK PM Theresa May’s position within her own party back
at home. An estimated two-thirds of a million people took to the
streets of London at the weekend demanding another referendum on
Brexit.
    In corporate news, trade-hit automakers will be in focus
after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli unit for
6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hit last week by
Daimler's profit warning, could find support after Chancellor
Angela Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the
threat of air pollution leading to driving bans. Italian banks
could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after
the  Moody's move. In earnings, eyes were on Ryanair after it
posted a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warned that
European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter.
Philips saw its profit rising less than expected, due to
currency headwinds.

election results on Tuesday at the earliest, an election
official said, after an exit poll showed the ruling Law and
Justice (PiS) scored limited gains in Sunday's contest.
    The eurosceptic PiS scored 32.3 percent backing in the race
for regional assemblies but unexpectedly lost a landmark battle
over liberal Warsaw in the first round of voting. [nL8N1X104A]
    ""When it comes to the collective results of the election
they might be released on Tuesday, Wednesday,"" Wieslaw
Kozielewicz, the deputy head of the electoral committee, told a
news conference on Monday.
    The PiS result indicated by the poll appears stronger than
its result in regional elections four years ago, when it gained
26.9 percent, but worse than a 2015 parliamentary election tally
of 37.6 percent.
    In most cities a second round of voting will be needed to
decide who will become their mayors.
    The result puts a question mark over its ability to defeat
the opposition, despite huge social transfers, record-low
unemployment, high economic growth and a strong pro-PiS campaign
conducted by state media.
    ""This is not a victory they (PiS) could be happy about, it's
a Pyrrhic victory ... This skirmish was not in favour of PiS,
but after three years in power this referendum did not go so
badly for the PiS,"" Marek Migalski, a political scientist and
former PiS European Parliament MP told TVN24 broadcaster.
    The exit polls suggests PiS may be unable to rule in most
regional assembly constituencies as two biggest opposition
groupings - centrist Civic Platform (PO) in coalition with
liberal Nowoczesna and agrarian PSL party - achieved a combined
41.3 percent of votes. In most biggest cities PO won.
    ""We always have had worse result in regional election than
in parliamentary election,"" upper house of parliament deputy
speaker and ruling coalition MP Adam Bielan told TVN24. 
    ""The time for assessment will come only after the second
round of regional election is conducted."" 
    A number of factors contributed to the worse-than-expected
outcome for the ruling party, including mistakes in the final
days of the campaign that mobilised the opposition electorate.
    On Friday the European Union's top court ruled that Poland
should suspend an overhaul of the country's Supreme Court and
reinstate judges forced into early retirement by PiS. The party
that was accused by rigthts groups of breaching European norms
by exerting too much power over the judiciary. [nnL8N1WZ4G7] 
    ""We don't know what the government will do, but according to
the EU court's decision that we've learned about last week, the
judges can come back to work today,"" the Supreme Court
spokesperson said.

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
dropped across the curve on Monday after ratings agency Moody's
kept the country's sovereign ratings outlook stable while
delivering an expected downgrade on Friday [nL3N1WZ5VO].
    Investors were worried the agency would not only downgrade
Italy's sovereign rating to Baa3 - the lowest investment grade 
- but also set the outlook at ""negative"", increasing the risk of
a junk rating for the euro zone's third-largest economy. 
    ""Not only did Moody's keep the ratings outlook as stable,
but they were also fairly optimistic on the Italy deficit,
saying it could be around 2.5 percent for the next three years,""
said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz. 
    ""Other calculations, including ours, come to different
(higher) conclusions, so overall it looks like a downgrade to
junk is unlikely now from Moody's in the short term. We don't
expect one from S&P, either,"" Lenz added. 
    S&P Global is scheduled to review Italy's credit rating on
Friday. It now rates the country two notches above junk at BBB. 
    Italy's five-year government bond yield dropped 36 basis
points to a two-week low of 2.63 percent. The benchmark 10-year
yield was 26.5 bps lower at 3.39 percent, its biggest daily drop
since early June <IT5YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR>. 
    The Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread
tightened to 284 bps <DE10IT10=RR>. 
    The rally follows late-Friday gains that came after European
Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he wanted to
reduce tensions with Italy.
    Italy's two-year government bond yield also extended falls
by as much as 43 bps, reaching a two-week low of 1.24 percent,
after Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated
that the country does not intend to leave the euro [nR1N1VZ022].
    Short-dated Italian debt has been particularly sensitive to
any hint the country may reconsider its membership of the single
currency bloc. 
    This came after an Italian government source told Reuters
the European Commission was set to ask Italy to revise its draft
budget on Tuesday, the first time ever it would take such action
against a member state [nL8N1X10UW].
    Di Maio said the Italian government was ready to discuss
spending plans with the EU authorities.     
    ""It does sound like there is a path to compromise,"" Lenz of
DZ Bank said. ""Investors are even speculating that Italy might
consider reducing the budget deficit further.""
    Spanish and Portuguese government 10-year bond yields also
dropped on Monday, by about 8 bps each. <ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR> 
    That was partly because of the Italian bond rally but also
because Moody's changed its ratings outlook for the Spanish
region of Catalonia to stable from negative. It said the economy
had not been hurt by its unilateral declaration of independence
last year [nMDY11HDGQ].
    Higher-grade euro zone bond yields rose as they lost some of
their safe-haven bid, both in the light of the Italian news and
as global stock markets rallied on hopes of stimulus from the
Chinese central bank [MKTS/GLOB].
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, was up 4.5 bps to 0.48 percent. <DE10YT=RR>

693,4554,464365afb35fcb38d31aeeef30424c48,"Greek current account surplus shrinks in August, tourism revenues rise",2018-10-22 16:16:52,EUR,0.0,2018-10-22 16:16:59,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    ATHENS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Greece's current account balance
showed a smaller surplus in August compared to the same month a
year earlier on the back of a wider trade deficit and a
deterioration in the primary income balance, the Bank of Greece
said on Monday.
    Central bank data showed the surplus shrank to 1.564 billion
euros ($1.80 billion) from a surplus of 1.826 billion euros in
August 2017. Tourism revenues increased to 3.6 billion euros
from 3.55 billion in the same month a year earlier.
    ""In July the current account showed a surplus of 1.6 billion
euros, down by 262 million year-on-year, mainly due to a
deterioration in the primary income account, which was
attributable to lower receipts from dividends, interest and
profits,"" the Bank of Greece said.
    It said the trade gap rose slightly despite a pickup in
export growth.
    In January to August, Greece's current account showed a
deficit of 910 million euros, up by 857 million euros
year-on-year as the trade deficit widened and the primary income
account surplus shrank.
    In 2017 as a whole, Greece's current account deficit reached
1.5 billion euros, down by 418 million year-on-year.

    ISTANBUL, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Five Turkish employees of the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul are giving statements as witnesses
under an investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, Turkish broadcaster NTV said on Monday.
    Twenty consulate workers, including the consul's driver,
gave statements to prosecutors in relation to the incident last
week, NTV has reported previously. Prosecutors are seeking
statements from a total of 45 employees, CNN Turk said.
    Khashoggi went missing on Oct. 2 when he entered the
consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming
marriage. After weeks of denying knowledge of his fate, Saudi
officials said the prominent journalist was killed in a ""rogue
operation"".
    Comments from Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on
Sunday were some of the most direct yet from Riyadh, which has
given multiple and conflicting accounts about Khashoggi's
killing on Oct. 2, first denying his death and later admitting
it amid an international outcry. [nL2N1X107K]
    Jubeir called Khashoggi's killing a ""huge and grave
mistake,"" but sought to shield its powerful crown prince from
the widening crisis, saying Mohammed bin Salman had not been
aware.
    After two weeks denying any involvement in the 59-year-old's
disappearance, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said Khashoggi, a critic
of the crown prince, died during a fight in the building. An
hour later, another Saudi official attributed the death to a
chokehold. [nL8N1X108Q]
    ""Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the
strongest possible terms,"" Germany, Britain and France said in
their joint statement.
    In a speech on Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan
appeared to suggest he was getting ready to release some
information about the Turkish investigation, and would do so at
his weekly speech on Tuesday to members of his ruling AK Party.
[nL8N1X10PV]
    Erdogan has remained largely silent on the case, although
Turkey's pro-government newspapers have released information
about events at the consulate. Turkish sources say the
authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting
Khashoggi's murder inside the consulate.

shipbuilding group Uljanik <ULJN.ZA> on Monday held their second
strike in less than two months, this time over unpaid salary for
September.
    In late August, the workers downed tools because of
uncertainty over payments for July and August. Those two months'
salaries were secured after the government reached a deal with a
local bank. [nL8N1VM3QV]
    Uljanik owns two docks, with some 4,000 workers, located in
the northern Adriatic cities of Pula and Rijeka. Some 1,500
started a protest march on Monday through the streets of Pula.
    The shipbuilding group has had liquidity problems in the
last 12 months. In January, the government helped it stay afloat
with state guarantees for a loan worth 96 million euros ($111
million). [nB5N1JD02F]
    Under European Union rules, no further state guarantees or
direct payments from the budget are allowed.
    Earlier this year, Uljanik chose local firm Kermas Energija
as its strategic partner and submitted a restructuring plan,
which the European Commission rejected as inadequate. Management
has yet to complete another restructuring plan.
    The chosen strategic partner reportedly aimed to convert
part of the shipyard into a tourism business, drawing worker
opposition. Economy Minister Darko Horvat said the government
was also in contact with potential investors from Ukraine, Italy
and the Netherlands.
    Finance Minister Zdravko Maric said last week the state
might have to pay 4.2 billion kuna ($651 million) for the costs
of state guarantees extended to Uljanik in the past.
[nL8N1WY2FR]
    Workers control less than 50 percent of the company, with
the state also being a minority shareholder. Other owners
include several local banks and the country's top insurer,
Croatia Osiguranje <CROR.ZA>.
    Croatia's once-prosperous shipbuilding industry has
struggled to survive since independence from Yugoslavia in the
early 1990s. It has lost business to Asian shipbuilders, such as
those in South Korea, missing opportunities to modernise and
produce more sophisticated vessels.

    By Conor Humphries
    DUBLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Ryanair <RYA.I> hopes to reach
deals with all of its major unions by Christmas, in a sign an
end may be in sight to the damaging flight disruptions which
have dragged on its shares.
    The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, on Monday
reported a 7 percent fall in profits due in part to high fuel
costs and intense competition, but it said these factors were
helping it resolve its industrial relations troubles.
    ""Given the adverse environment that's out there for airlines
and the number of job losses being reported in recent weeks both
by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common
sense approach being taken by the unions,"" Chief Executive
Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation. 
    Recent progress ""leaves us with only really Germany and to a
lesser extent Belgium as the only two larger markets where we
haven't now concluded agreements,"" O'Leary said. 
    ""We would be hopeful of concluding agreements with them this
side of Christmas,"" he added.
    Ryanair shares were 3.9 percent higher at 11.97 euros at
0925 GMT, partly because the fall in April-September profit was
less than the 9 percent drop forecast by analysts.
    Investors have also been watching closely for progress in
talks with unions after a year of turmoil since Ryanair bowed to
pressure to recognise them for the first time last December.
     
    UNION AWAITS OFFER
    Ryanair's shares are down 17 percent compared to three
months ago and by almost 40 percent from a peak of 19.39 euros
in August last year.
    The airline issued a profit warning on Oct. 1 citing damage
to booking from strikes and cutting its forecast for full-year
profit by 12 percent. [nL8N1WH1EH]
    It also angered unions by closing bases in Germany and the
Netherlands and on Monday Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan
said cutting capacity further ""would probably be the sensible
thing to do"" if oil prices climb or fares fall further.
    A spokesman for Belgium's LBC-NVK union said it was waiting
for an offer from Ryanair on Thursday and said they had warned
the airline they could strike again if there is no progress. 
    A spokesman for German unions VC and Verdi did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.
    Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer,
reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the
six months to Sept. 30, better than the 1.127 billion euros
forecast in a company poll of more than 10 analysts. 
    Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said this was due to a smaller
than expected loss at subsidiary Laudamotion and a lower tax
charge and said the results pointed to good cost control and an
attractive foreign exchange hedge. 
    But Ryanair would have to follow up on union recognition
agreements with more complex collective labour agreements, which
""does leave the risk of further disruption as negotiations
continue"", Simpson added.

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The buyout group is
paying $7.1 billion for a Fiat Chrysler-owned supplier. The
double-digit earnings multiple is a coup for new FCA CEO Mike
Manley. The big premium to where the industry trades needs some
justifying. But regular investors may also be too gloomy about
the sector.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Calsonic Kansei on Oct. 22 said it has agreed to buy Fiat
Chrysler’s car-parts business Magneti Marelli for a total
transaction value of 6.2 billion euros. The Japanese auto
supplier, owned by private-equity group KKR, said its Chief
Executive Beda Bolzenius will lead the combined group. 
    - The sale is the first big decision for newly minted FCA
Chief Executive Mike Manley, who took over in July after
long-time boss Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died due to
complications from surgery. 
    - KKR bought Calsonic from Nissan and other shareholders in
2016. At the time, it said it would help Calsonic, which relies
on Nissan for the bulk of its global sales, to expand
internationally. 
    - Fiat’s Milan-listed shares were up 5.4 percent to 14.16
euros at 0800 GMT on Oct. 22.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: UP BUT OFF HIGHS (0942 GMT)
    The news on the Italian rating front has provided some more relief to investors which,
combined with hopes of economic stimulus in China, has pushed the European markets back into
positive territory following three straight sessions in the red.
    After the initial buoyancy, however, main country benchmarks have come off highs,
illustrating how investors prefer to refrain from taking big risks as potential headwinds
abound.
    Italy -- which is just one of the possible problem areas -- is due to send a letter on its
budget to the EU Commission by noon today and despite the conciliatory remarks from Commissioner
Moscovici, expectations are running quite low, suggesting more volatility ahead.
    ""Investors are almost certain that Italy's reply to the EU is unlikely to suffice to stop
the EU Commission from rejecting the budget plan,"" says Alexander Aldinger at BayernLB.

    WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR: EUROPE SET TO SNAP 3-DAY LOSING STREAK (0651 GMT)
    European shares are expected to snap a three-day losing streak at the open today, helped by
deal-making activity and after Moody's kept its outlook on Italy at stable on Friday, while some
downbeat earning updates could weigh. Euro STOXX 50 futures are up 0.8 percent.
    Trade-hit automakers will be in focus after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli
unit for 6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hurt last week by Daimler's profit warning,
could find support after Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the threat of air
pollution leading to driving bans. [nL3N1X229D] [nL8N1X10X0]
    Italian banks could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after Moody's kept
the Italy's sovereign ratings outlook stable while delivering an expected downgrade on Friday.

    This week 22 percent of the STOXX 600's market will have reported results. European earnings
are seen up 13.6 percent in the third quarter, while euro zone earnings are seen up 11.7
percent. US earnings are expected to rise more than 22 percent.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN SHARES SEEN SLIGHTLY UP (0525 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open slightly higher today as earning updates continue to
roll in and investors await for further developments in Brexit negotiations following a big
march in London over the weekend to demand a second vote [nL8N1X00FF]. Eyes are also on Italy's
budget discussions following Moody's downgrade on Friday [nL3N1WZ5VO].
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 19 points higher at 7,046, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 15 points lower at 11,574 and Paris' CAC to open 3 points lower at 5,113. 
    Over in Asia, shares pared early losses as Chinese stocks swung higher for a second session
on Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. That helped offset geopolitical
concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit. [nL3N1X203D]

 (Recasts, add shares, analyst, details throughout)
    By Junko Fujita and Agnieszka Flak 
    TOKYO/MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan's Calsonic Kansei,
owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR <KKR.N>, has agreed to buy
Fiat Chrysler's <FCHA.MI> Magneti Marelli for 6.2 billion euros
($7.1 billion) to form the seventh-largest independent car parts
supplier.
    The first big deal by FCA's newly-appointed chief executive
Mike Manley, who took over in July after the sudden death of
long-time boss Sergio Marchionne, creates a company with revenue
of 15.2 billion euros ($17.5 billion), the companies said.
    The newly formed Magneti Marelli CK Holdings is likely to
cut costs through synergies and expand its customer base as
components makers try to keep up with a shift by carmakers into
autonomous driving, connected cars and electric vehicles.
    ""This combination with Calsonic Kansei has emerged as an
ideal opportunity to accelerate Magneti Marelli's future
growth,"" Manley said on Monday of the FCA unit, which
specialises in lighting, powertrain and high-tech electronics. 
    FCA shares were up 5.2 percent at 0906 GMT as investors
welcomed the hefty price tag, which will boost FCA's net cash
position and raises expectations of a share buyback.
    ""Getting this transaction completed at the price agreed is a
significant early milestone and accomplishment,"" George
Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said of Manley and his
team's ability to match Marchionne's deal-making reputation.
    Marchionne had set in motion a process to spin off the unit
and distribute its shares to FCA shareholders by early 2019, but
said in June that FCA would still be ""receptive"" to an offer.
    Neither FCA nor its top shareholder, Fiat's founding Agnelli
family, will have a stake in the combined business but FCA said
it would enter into a multi-year agreement to secure supplies to
its plants and also to maintain operations and staff in Italy.
    
    GLOBAL AMBITION
    KKR bought Calsonic from Nissan and other shareholders in
2016, saying it would help the parts maker, which relies on the
Japanese carmaker for most of its sales, to expand globally.
    Calsonic has been in talks with FCA for months and made an
initial 5.8 billion euro bid, sources have said. [nL8N1W7400]
    FCA does not break out earnings for Magneti Marelli, which
sits within its components unit alongside robotics specialist
Comau and castings firm Teksid. The unit employs around 43,000
people and operates in 19 countries.
    A takeover of Magneti Marelli had remained elusive as
potential bidders were offering too little or were only
interested in some parts of the business. 
    FCA also preferred the Calsonic offer to a pure private
equity bidder because it limits the risk of the unit being
broken up, sources have said. 
    JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were financial advisers to FCA
on the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of
next year and is subject to regulatory approvals.

    AUTOS: SPICING IT UP WITH BREAKUPS (1132 GMT) 
    Fiat Chrysler's <FCHA.MI> 6.2 billion euros sale of high-tech parts-making unit Magneti
Marelli to KKR is quite a coup for the Italian-American carmaker's new boss Mike Manley and it's
by extension quite a big deal for the European automotive sector, which is deep in bear market
territory (about 30 pct). 
    The dismantling of conglomerates, from General Electric to Siemens, had been identified as a
tempting trade and trend for 2018 but had so far been a disappointment, in particular in the
telco and car industry.
    ""We are excited about longer term upside opportunities,"" Barclays analysts said in February
about the structural reviews unveiled by management teams at Daimler, Volkswagen and Continental
and amid rumours those German giants could follow the footsteps of the arguably successful
spin-off of Ferrari from Fiat Chrysler.
    One clear positive of the Marelli deal is that the divestment has been made at an
encouraging price and not through an IPO, which often seems like a last resort.
    ""While it is no secret that FCA has been intending to separate Marelli from its core
business, both the structure of the transaction, sale vs. spin-out, and the valuation are net
positives for investors in our view"", Evercore ISI analysts commented. 
    At the moment, Fiat Chrysler is up 5.3 percent and the whole European automotive sector is
running at about 0.7 percent, twice as fast as the general market.
    Another high profile breakup:

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: UP BUT OFF HIGHS (0942 GMT)
    The news on the Italian rating front has provided some more relief to investors which,
combined with hopes of economic stimulus in China, has pushed the European markets back into
positive territory following three straight sessions in the red.
    After the initial buoyancy, however, main country benchmarks have come off highs,
illustrating how investors prefer to refrain from taking big risks as potential headwinds
abound.
    Italy -- which is just one of the possible problem areas -- is due to send a letter on its
budget to the EU Commission by noon today and despite the conciliatory remarks from Commissioner
Moscovici, expectations are running quite low, suggesting more volatility ahead.
    ""Investors are almost certain that Italy's reply to the EU is unlikely to suffice to stop
the EU Commission from rejecting the budget plan,"" says Alexander Aldinger at BayernLB.

    WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR: EUROPE SET TO SNAP 3-DAY LOSING STREAK (0651 GMT)
    European shares are expected to snap a three-day losing streak at the open today, helped by
deal-making activity and after Moody's kept its outlook on Italy at stable on Friday, while some
downbeat earning updates could weigh. Euro STOXX 50 futures are up 0.8 percent.
    Trade-hit automakers will be in focus after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli
unit for 6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hurt last week by Daimler's profit warning,
could find support after Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the threat of air
pollution leading to driving bans. [nL3N1X229D] [nL8N1X10X0]
    Italian banks could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after Moody's kept
the Italy's sovereign ratings outlook stable while delivering an expected downgrade on Friday.
    In earnings, eyes on Ryanair after it posted a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warned
that European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter, while Philips saw its profit
rising less than expected, due to currency headwinds. [nS8N1WP004] [nL8N1X20NQ]
    This week 22 percent of the STOXX 600's market will have reported results. European earnings
are seen up 13.6 percent in the third quarter, while euro zone earnings are seen up 11.7
percent. US earnings are expected to rise more than 22 percent.

car maker agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli unit for $7.1 billion, while in results, Ryanair
<RYA.I> could be under pressure after posting a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warning

    European shares are expected to open slightly higher today as earning updates continue to
roll in and investors await for further developments in Brexit negotiations following a big

    Over in Asia, shares pared early losses as Chinese stocks swung higher for a second session

 (Adds Italy Treasury comments, background)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Italian sovereign bond yields
headed on Monday for their biggest daily drop since June after
Moody's agency held off cutting the country's credit rating
outlook to negative and the government promised not to expand
the deficit further.
    Moody's downgraded Italy's rating to Baa3 - the lowest
investment grade category - on Friday as expected. But investors
had fretted it would also set the outlook at ""negative""
following high-spending budget proposals that put Rome at odds
with Brussels.
    Moody's kept the outlook at stable, triggering a relief
rally across Italian bond and stock markets. [nL3N1WZ5VO]  
    That decision pushed the threat of a ratings cut to junk
further into the future. Fears of such a cut had recently sent
bond yields to 4-1/2-year highs.
    ""Not only did Moody's keep the ratings outlook as stable,
but they were also fairly optimistic on the Italy deficit,
saying it could be around 2.5 percent for the next three years,""
said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz. 
    ""Other calculations, including ours, come to different
(higher) conclusions, so overall it looks like a downgrade to
junk is unlikely now from Moody's in the short term. We don't
expect one from S&P, either,"" Lenz added. 
    Italy's two-year government bond yield dropped 25 basis
points to a two-week low of 1.42 percent. The benchmark 10-year
yield was 14 bps lower at 3.44 percent at 1045 GMT <IT2YT=RR>
<IT5YT=RR>.    
    
    
    The Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread
tightened below the 300 basis point mark <DE10IT10=RR> at the
same time. 
    However, jitters remain as the European Union is expected to
ask Italy on Tuesday to revise its draft budget in what would be
the first such action against a member state. [nL8N1X10UW]
    S&P Global also is scheduled to review Italy's credit rating
on Friday. It now rates the country two notches above junk at
BBB and has the outlook at stable. 
    Analyst expectations are mixed, with some expecting a
one-notch downgrade while others expect only a change in the
outlook to negative from stable currently. 
    The session was volatile as a result; yields rose off early
lows, before receiving fresh impetus to move down around 10.15
GMT when the Italian Treasury told the European Commission it
would stick to its contested budget plans, but promised not to
further expand the deficit in the 2020-2021 period. [nR1N1VZ02J]
    Should the EU decide to reject the draft budget anyway, it
would formally begin a long legal dispute that will increase
market pressure on Italy until it is resolved. [nL8N1WV23B]    
    Spanish and Portuguese government 10-year bond yields also
dropped on Monday, by about five bps each. <ES10YT=RR>
<PT10YT=RR> 
    Higher-grade euro zone bond yields rose as they lost some of
their safe-haven bid, both in the light of the Italian news and
as global stock markets rallied on hopes of stimulus from the
Chinese central bank [MKTS/GLOB].
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, was up 4 bps to 0.475 percent. <DE10YT=RR>

in 2017 amounted to 0.9 percent of gross domestic product, the
state statistics bureau said on Monday, slightly revising
upwards its figure from April when it said the surplus was 0.8
percent.
    The surplus amounted to 3.16 billion kuna ($488.73 million).
    It is the first time Croatia had recorded a budget surplus.
    The statistics bureau also said that Croatia's public debt
at the end of last year amounted to 77.5 percent of GDP, or
283.3 billion kuna, down from 80.2 percent a year before.
    Croatia wants to reduce its public debt towards 60 percent
of GDP in the coming years as the government said its goal was

expires in late 2020, wants Croatia to join the European
Exchange Mechanism (ERM-2) in early 2020, a tool for testing the
currency stability before joining the euro. Staying in ERM-2 is
necessary for at least two years.
    For this year the government plans a general budget deficit
of 0.5 percent.

    BERLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf
Scholz said on Monday that Italy with its large debt level had
to be more careful when taking on new debt, adding it was now up
to Italian politicians to resolve their budget dispute with the
European Commission.
    The Italian Treasury told the European Commission on Monday
that it would stick to its contested budget plans, but promised
to intervene if it failed to meet its debt and deficit goals
[nL8N1X22UD].
    The draft budget for 2019 boosts welfare spending, lowers
the retirement age and widens the deficit to 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product [nL8N1WV1L6]. That is below the European
Union's threshold of 3 percent of GDP, but it threatens to
increase Italy's debt, now around 130 percent of GDP.
    ""Actually it's pretty simple: Someone with a lot of debt has
to be more careful when taking on new debt than someone who has
little debt,"" Scholz said during an event about Europe when
asked by a citizen to comment on Italy.
    ""When you have a debt level of 130 percent of economic
output, which is the case in Italy, then you simply have to be
more careful,"" said Scholz, a member of the centre-left Social
Democrats (SPD).
    Scholz said it was the job of the European Commission, the
EU's executive arm, to warn Rome that its draft budget was
violating the rules of the bloc's growth and stability pact.
    He added that he did not want to ""to play the game of the
populists"" who think they can ignore the rules and at the end
others will pay the bill.
    ""That's why it's so important that we say this has to be
decided there. This is a decision that has to be taken in Italy
and they have to deal with it,"" Scholz said.
    But the Social Democrat also had some praise for the Italian
government, pointing to Rome's efforts to introduce a
state-backed insurance scheme for long-term unemployed.
    ""This shows that not all ideas that are currently under
discussion there are totally unrealistic,"" Scholz said.
    The European Commission said last week Italy's budgetary
plan was in clear breach of EU fiscal rules. It will discuss and
decide on Tuesday the next steps in the procedure for assessing
Italy's 2019 draft budget.

    ""WHAT WOULD MAKE US REVERSE OUR PREFERENCE FOR US OVER EUROPE?"" (1245 GMT)
    JP Morgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka are giving the old continent a (slim) chance. 
    Even though they've just confirmed their overweight U.S. vs European stocks, they look at
what could possibly help them change their mind, and - surprise, surprise - say earnings & Italy
play the key role.
    Their cautious view on the Italian outlook and expectations that the relative US/Europe
earnings trend is not going to reverse for the time being however means it's still too early to
make the jump. 
    ""We need clarity on Italy to buy into (the) Eurozone trade,"" they say.
    ""While the deterioration is unlikely to happen in a straight line, our concern is that
peripheral spreads will remain elevated, the new Italian government will stay confrontational
and the bond market will keep testing them,"" they add.
    ""We do not see European earnings outperforming the US in the near future, and have in our Q3
preview argued that upcoming results in Europe will be unhelpful,"" they note.

    AUTOS: SPICING IT UP WITH BREAKUPS (1132 GMT) 
    Fiat Chrysler's <FCHA.MI> 6.2 billion euros sale of high-tech parts-making unit Magneti
Marelli to KKR is quite a coup for the Italian-American carmaker's new boss Mike Manley and it's
by extension quite a big deal for the European automotive sector, which is deep in bear market
territory (about 30 pct). 
    The dismantling of conglomerates, from General Electric to Siemens, had been identified as a
tempting trade and trend for 2018 but had so far been a disappointment, in particular in the
telco and car industry.
    ""We are excited about longer term upside opportunities,"" Barclays analysts said in February
about the structural reviews unveiled by management teams at Daimler, Volkswagen and Continental
and amid rumours those German giants could follow the footsteps of the arguably successful
spin-off of Ferrari from Fiat Chrysler.
    One clear positive of the Marelli deal is that the divestment has been made at an
encouraging price and not through an IPO, which often seems like a last resort.
    ""While it is no secret that FCA has been intending to separate Marelli from its core
business, both the structure of the transaction, sale vs. spin-out, and the valuation are net
positives for investors in our view"", Evercore ISI analysts commented. 
    At the moment, Fiat Chrysler is up 5.3 percent and the whole European automotive sector is
running at about 0.7 percent, twice as fast as the general market.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: UP BUT OFF HIGHS (0942 GMT)
    The news on the Italian rating front has provided some more relief to investors which,
combined with hopes of economic stimulus in China, has pushed the European markets back into
positive territory following three straight sessions in the red.
    After the initial buoyancy, however, main country benchmarks have come off highs,
illustrating how investors prefer to refrain from taking big risks as potential headwinds
abound.
    Italy -- which is just one of the possible problem areas -- is due to send a letter on its
budget to the EU Commission by noon today and despite the conciliatory remarks from Commissioner
Moscovici, expectations are running quite low, suggesting more volatility ahead.
    ""Investors are almost certain that Italy's reply to the EU is unlikely to suffice to stop
the EU Commission from rejecting the budget plan,"" says Alexander Aldinger at BayernLB.

    WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR: EUROPE SET TO SNAP 3-DAY LOSING STREAK (0651 GMT)
    European shares are expected to snap a three-day losing streak at the open today, helped by
deal-making activity and after Moody's kept its outlook on Italy at stable on Friday, while some
downbeat earning updates could weigh. Euro STOXX 50 futures are up 0.8 percent.
    Trade-hit automakers will be in focus after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli
unit for 6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hurt last week by Daimler's profit warning,
could find support after Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the threat of air
pollution leading to driving bans. [nL3N1X229D] [nL8N1X10X0]
    Italian banks could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after Moody's kept
the Italy's sovereign ratings outlook stable while delivering an expected downgrade on Friday.
    In earnings, eyes on Ryanair after it posted a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warned
that European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter, while Philips saw its profit
rising less than expected, due to currency headwinds. [nS8N1WP004] [nL8N1X20NQ]
    This week 22 percent of the STOXX 600's market will have reported results. European earnings
are seen up 13.6 percent in the third quarter, while euro zone earnings are seen up 11.7
percent. US earnings are expected to rise more than 22 percent.

    European shares are expected to open slightly higher today as earning updates continue to
roll in and investors await for further developments in Brexit negotiations following a big
march in London over the weekend to demand a second vote [nL8N1X00FF]. Eyes are also on Italy's
budget discussions following Moody's downgrade on Friday [nL3N1WZ5VO].

    Over in Asia, shares pared early losses as Chinese stocks swung higher for a second session

    BRUSSELS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The European Commission will
discuss and decide on Tuesday the next steps in the procedure
for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget, a Commission spokesman
said on Monday.
    The EU executive confirmed it had received a reply from
Italy on its budget by a Monday deadline, after the Commission
said last week the country's budgetary plan was in clear breach
of EU fiscal rules and demanded clarifications from Rome.
    ""Tomorrow the Commission will discuss the procedure and will
determine the next steps,"" the spokesman told a news conference.
    On Tuesday the EU Executive holds its weekly meeting.
    Under EU rules, the Commission has time until Oct. 29 to
decide whether to send back the budget to Rome for changes. 
    If it did so, Italy would have three weeks to amend its
budgetary plans from the date of the Commission's rejection.
    The stand-off could be prolonged for weeks if the budget
remained unchanged. [nL8N1WV23B]

    Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open higher at
the start of a busy week of earnings on Monday, as global stocks
rose on hopes of economic stimulus in China and an easing of
tensions over Italy's debt.
    Shanghai's benchmark blue-chip index <.CSI300> surged over 4
percent after China promised to provide stimulus to stabilize
its economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. [.SS]
    U.S.-listed shares of Chinese heavyweights Alibaba <BABA.N>,
JD.com <JD.O> and Baidu <BIDU.O> rose about 3 percent in
premarket trading.
    ""Anytime you've got European markets or Asian markets
trading higher as we come into our open, we tend to get a
positive open,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading
and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.
    Investors also took relief from a Moody's report kept
Italy's sovereign rating outlook at stable, boosting shares in
Europe. 
    The Italian Treasury said it did not intend to further
expand the budget deficit in 2020 and 2021, easing some worries
about the country's debt. [nL8N1X22UD]
    ""I am expecting a little bit of a bounce today, but the rest
of this week is going to be volatile like we saw last week,""
Frederick added.
    The S&P 500 <.SPX> ended last week with little gains as
fears about global growth and rising interest rates induced
volatility into markets and overshadowed some strong quarterly
earnings reports.
    Investors are looking ahead to earnings from about 160 S&P
500 companies this week, including those of Microsoft <MSFT.O>,
Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O>.
    Ahead of the pivotal congressional elections, U.S. President
Donald Trump said the administration was studying a tax cut for
middle-income earners, which according to Charles Schwab's
Fredrick, was adding to market optimism. [nL2N1X00C9]
    Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts,
profit of S&P 500 companies are expected to grow 22 percent in
the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
    At 8:55 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 91 points, or
0.36 percent. S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> were up 10.5 points, or
0.38 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> were up 56.75 points,
or 0.8 percent.
    Kimberly-Clark rose 1.6 percent after the Huggies diaper
maker said its Chief Executive Officer Thomas Falk will step
down and posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit.
[nL3N1X23WX] 
    Intel gained 1.1 percent after Nomura upgraded the stock to
""buy"", according to a trader.
    Hasbro <HAS.O> tumbled 5.7 percent after its quarterly
results missed estimates, as the demise of major retail partner
Toys 'R' Us hurt sales in the United States and Europe.
[nL3N1X23NX]
    Rival Mattel <MAT.O> also fell 3.8 percent.

    WARSAW, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Poland's ruling eurosceptics
could see their firm grip on power loosened over the next couple
of years as liberal, city-dwellers angry at the government's
democratic record are voting against them in growing numbers,
regional elections showed.
    Final results of Sunday's nationwide ballot for city hall
chiefs and provincial assemblies will be published on Tuesday at
the earliest, the electoral commission said on Monday. But exit
polls showed Law and Justice (PiS) made only limited gains and
lost a high-profile contest for Warsaw mayor.
    While still more popular than the centrist opposition around
the country overall, the PiS government saw its support fall in
big cities, traditionally bastions of liberalism in Poland.
    The outcome lays bare mounting divisions in the country over
PiS policies toward the judiciary and media that critics at home
and abroad say point to a tilt towards authoritarianism. 
    PiS says its institutional reforms aim at making Poland a
fairer society that is less dependent on the European Union.
    ""The magnitude of our victory is not what we had expected,""
Zbigniew Kuzmiuk, a PiS member of the European Parliament, told
public radio. ""There was an extraordinary mobilisation on the
other side, because of the polarisation (of society).""
    The election is part of a larger battle for Europe's soul as
Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban - who like PiS believes the
EU's powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc and
right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
    An exit poll by Ipsos pollster showed PiS scoring 33 percent
of votes for provincial assemblies, against 26.7 percent for a
centrist coalition. 
    In cities of over 500,000 inhabitants, PiS won 23.1 percent,
against 47.3 percent for its main opponents. Four years earlier,
that gap stood at 25.2 percent against 44.1 percent.
    Markets showed little reaction to Sunday's vote, although
economists said PiS may have to loosen the purse strings in the
coming months as it heads toward a parliamentary election in
2019 and a presidential vote in 2020.
    If repeated in the parliamentary election, the provincial
assembly results would mean PiS could struggle to retain its
grip on power without entering into a coalition.
        
    WARSAW POWER
    Exit polls also showed that PiS lost most of the 10 large
cities where voting was surveyed, although several contests face
a runoff on Nov. 4.
    In the race for Warsaw mayor, centrist candidate Rafal
Trzaskowski, 46, unexpectedly won office in the first round,
with 54.1 percent of vote, more than the 50 percent needed to
avoid a runoff.
    ""European issues were used as a bugbear in this election,""
said Jaroslaw Flis, a political scientist from the Jagiellonian
University in the southern city of Krakow.
    Underscoring tensions over Poland's relationship with the EU
and the country's contested judiciary reforms, the Supreme Court
on Monday urged judges forcibly retired by PiS to return to the
work.
    Its call follows a decision by the European Court of Justice
that Warsaw should suspend an overhaul of the top court and
reinstate the forcibly retired judges.
    Most Poles back EU membership. But PiS has consistently
accused Brussels institutions of hurting its efforts to reform
the nation which it says has lost touch with conservative
Catholic roots and become too liberal.
    Krzysztof Goworek, a 41-year-old financial market analyst,
is among the urban voters who find its rhetoric unacceptable.
    ""I don't like what's going on in the country,"" he said
outside a voting station in Warsaw. ""All these games around
democratic standards which are in place in Poland.""

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - British carmaker Aston Martin
<AML.L> is considering flying in components and moving more
parts through ports other than Dover if there is any border
friction after Britain leaves the EU, its boss told Reuters.
    London and Brussels hope to reach an agreement soon but the
automotive sector is worried that port and motorway snarl-ups
could disrupt production, affecting the movement of thousands of
components and vehicles to and from the continent every day.
    Aston, which earlier this month became the first British
carmaker in decades to list on the London Stock Exchange,
predominately uses Dover for moving components, but there is
concern the port may not be able to cope with new red tape.
    ""The European-sourced parts, which include the engine and
the gearbox as a complete assembly, come back in from Europe so
an alternative port is one way, predominately for lorries, and
then reserving space on aircrafts for one-off shipping,"" Chief
Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters. 
    ""You can get a few days of engines and gearboxes relatively
easily into the cargo decks of a plane so whilst it's relatively
expensive that is probably our primary backup,"" he said, adding
the firm only did so in an emergency at present. 
    Coventry and Birmingham airport, near the firm's central
English Gaydon plant, and the port of Sunderland are among the
locations the firm is considering for such contingencies. 
    With Britain due to leave the European Union on Mar. 29,
Palmer said the plan would have to be approved by the board by
the end of the year in a sign of the decisions executives are
needing to take without clarity on what Brexit will mean. 
    ""There is undoubtedly a cost associated with it, but it's
cheaper than not building cars,"" he said. 
    After earlier this year switching its car approvals from
Britain's vehicle agency to Spain's due to uncertainty over the
validity of such licences, Palmer said its next model, the
crossover DBX, will also be approved there. [nL8N1QG34Q] 
    ""You're forced to make a change,"" he told Reuters. ""Once you
set in place a process, you tend to stick with that process
because it works."" 
    The United States is also due to overtake Britain in 2018 as
the firm's single biggest country market as the firm continues a
strategy to mitigate Brexit risk with a U.S. sales drive,
reducing its reliance on the EU. [nL9N1H602O] 
    However, since listing at the start of the month, Aston's
share price has fallen by over 20 percent but Palmer said most
shareholders knew the firm would deliver long-term value as it
rolls out a series of new models. 
    ""When we made the pitch to investors, I think almost all
understood that this is basically a long-term story and it is
all about value creation... and that's what we are going to
deliver,"" he said.

    EUROPEAN SHARES HIT BY SUDDEN MOOD SWING ON ITALY (1359 GMT) 
    Everything seemed just nice and calm on European markets when all of a sudden, we noticed
that losses on Italian banks were dragging Milan down and that yields were starting to rise
again. Shortly after that, the STOXX was in the red and now down 0.35 percent.   
    No analysts we reached could provide a sole and definitive ""smoking gun"" for the reversal in
Italy, but here are a few interesting takes.
    ""These are roller coaster days. There was euphoria this morning and now we're back down to
earth. The truth is that nothing has really changed.... Probably someone has started to think
that Moody's rating move is not that positive after all,"" said Carlo Franchini, head of
institutional clients at Banca Ifigest in Milan.
     Italian yields got a boost on Monday after Moody's held off cutting the country's credit
rating outlook to negative. 
     ""Multiple research analysts were expecting a relief rally, but I think that we probably had
some profit taking as well,"" said Cyril Regnat, fixed income strategist at Natixis, noting ""the
probability of having a budget slippage next year is high."" 
    Ken Odeluga from City Index noted this story: Market turmoil forced Italy to tighten a bad
loan guarantee scheme as a possible driver of weakness. [nL8N1X237Q]
    ""This means bigger losses for banks, but market may be over-reacting,"" he wrote. 
    There's also a wider market context with the S&P 500 and the Dow opening in negative
territory, which is clearly not helping.

    ""WHAT WOULD MAKE US REVERSE OUR PREFERENCE FOR US OVER EUROPE?"" (1245 GMT)
    JP Morgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka are giving the old continent a (slim) chance. 
    Even though they've just confirmed their overweight U.S. vs European stocks, they look at
what could possibly help them change their mind, and - surprise, surprise - say earnings & Italy
play the key role.
    Their cautious view on the Italian outlook and expectations that the relative US/Europe
earnings trend is not going to reverse for the time being however means it's still too early to
make the jump. 
    ""We need clarity on Italy to buy into (the) Eurozone trade,"" they say.
    ""While the deterioration is unlikely to happen in a straight line, our concern is that
peripheral spreads will remain elevated, the new Italian government will stay confrontational
and the bond market will keep testing them,"" they add.
    ""We do not see European earnings outperforming the US in the near future, and have in our Q3
preview argued that upcoming results in Europe will be unhelpful,"" they note.

    AUTOS: SPICING IT UP WITH BREAKUPS (1132 GMT) 
    Fiat Chrysler's <FCHA.MI> 6.2 billion euros sale of high-tech parts-making unit Magneti
Marelli to KKR is quite a coup for the Italian-American carmaker's new boss Mike Manley and it's
by extension quite a big deal for the European automotive sector, which is deep in bear market
territory (about 30 pct). 
    The dismantling of conglomerates, from General Electric to Siemens, had been identified as a
tempting trade and trend for 2018 but had so far been a disappointment, in particular in the
telco and car industry.
    ""We are excited about longer term upside opportunities,"" Barclays analysts said in February
about the structural reviews unveiled by management teams at Daimler, Volkswagen and Continental
and amid rumours those German giants could follow the footsteps of the arguably successful
spin-off of Ferrari from Fiat Chrysler.
    One clear positive of the Marelli deal is that the divestment has been made at an
encouraging price and not through an IPO, which often seems like a last resort.
    ""While it is no secret that FCA has been intending to separate Marelli from its core
business, both the structure of the transaction, sale vs. spin-out, and the valuation are net
positives for investors in our view"", Evercore ISI analysts commented. 
    At the moment, Fiat Chrysler is up 5.3 percent and the whole European automotive sector is
running at about 0.7 percent, twice as fast as the general market.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: UP BUT OFF HIGHS (0942 GMT)
    The news on the Italian rating front has provided some more relief to investors which,
combined with hopes of economic stimulus in China, has pushed the European markets back into
positive territory following three straight sessions in the red.
    After the initial buoyancy, however, main country benchmarks have come off highs,
illustrating how investors prefer to refrain from taking big risks as potential headwinds
abound.
    Italy -- which is just one of the possible problem areas -- is due to send a letter on its
budget to the EU Commission by noon today and despite the conciliatory remarks from Commissioner
Moscovici, expectations are running quite low, suggesting more volatility ahead.
    ""Investors are almost certain that Italy's reply to the EU is unlikely to suffice to stop
the EU Commission from rejecting the budget plan,"" says Alexander Aldinger at BayernLB.

    WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR: EUROPE SET TO SNAP 3-DAY LOSING STREAK (0651 GMT)
    European shares are expected to snap a three-day losing streak at the open today, helped by
deal-making activity and after Moody's kept its outlook on Italy at stable on Friday, while some
downbeat earning updates could weigh. Euro STOXX 50 futures are up 0.8 percent.
    Trade-hit automakers will be in focus after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli
unit for 6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hurt last week by Daimler's profit warning,
could find support after Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the threat of air
pollution leading to driving bans. [nL3N1X229D] [nL8N1X10X0]
    Italian banks could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after Moody's kept
the Italy's sovereign ratings outlook stable while delivering an expected downgrade on Friday.
    In earnings, eyes on Ryanair after it posted a 7 percent fall in summer profits and warned
that European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter, while Philips saw its profit
rising less than expected, due to currency headwinds. [nS8N1WP004] [nL8N1X20NQ]
    This week 22 percent of the STOXX 600's market will have reported results. European earnings
are seen up 13.6 percent in the third quarter, while euro zone earnings are seen up 11.7
percent. US earnings are expected to rise more than 22 percent.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona-October 22: Fitch Ratings says that the decision by Fiat 
Chrysler Automobiles N.V.(FCA) to sell its automotive components business 
Magneti Marelli will be mildly positive for its overall credit profile but will 
not trigger an immediate upgrade to its rating (BB/Positive). 

The positive impact from this sale on FCA's debt position and leverage is likely 
to be limited in the short term as we expect some of the proceeds to be 
distributed to shareholders rather than applied to debt reduction. Nonetheless, 
FCA's funds from operations-adjusted net leverage has been declining 
consistently since 2012-2013 to less than 1x at end-2017 and we expect further 
improvement towards less than 0.5x by end-2020.

The sale of Magnetti Marelli has been anticipated and the announced transaction 
value, at EUR6.2 billion is at the high end of market expectations. The 
transaction will refocus FCA's business profile and investment requirements on 
the group's core auto manufacturing business. Automotive suppliers, similar to 
manufacturers, are increasing R&D and capex in response to changing industry 
trends such as the shift of powertrain towards electric engines and connected 
and autonomous vehicles. In particular, investment required to meet increasingly 
stringent emission regulation will burden Magnetti Marelli's cash generation in 
the coming years and its divestment will enable FCA to concentrate its financial 
resources on its other divisions.

The rating of FCA reflects our expectations that its free cash flow (FCF) margin 
will increase to more than 1.5% in the foreseeable future, a level commensurate 
with a higher rating. FCA has gained significant headroom in its ratings in the 
past 12 months with Fitch expecting sustainable FCF in the foreseeable future, 
combined with lower leverage.

The transaction is expected to close in 1H19, subject to regulatory approvals 
and other customary closing conditions.

721,4678,5b66a2fe3d0903f8251ab480945473f8,FACTBOX-How does a leadership challenge to a Conservative UK prime minister work?,2018-10-22 22:28:29,EUR,0.05296,2018-10-22 22:28:41,"{'EUR': 'Neutral', 'GBP': 'Positive'}","    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's
position as leader of the Conservative Party - and consequently
her premiership - is under threat, with some lawmakers who
oppose her approach to negotiating Britain's departure from the
European Union saying they are taking steps to call a confidence
vote. [nL8N1X10ID] 
    Below is an explanation of how May could face a leadership
challenge under the ruling Conservative Party's rules:
   
    - What needs to happen for there to be a leadership contest?
    A leadership challenge can be triggered if 15 percent of the
 Conservative members of parliament (MPs) write letters
demanding a confidence vote to the chairman of the party's ""1922
Committee"", which represents lawmakers who have no government
jobs.
    The Conservatives have 315 MPs so 48 would need to write
such letters for a confidence vote to be called.
    
    - Could this happen to May?
    Some eurosceptic MPs say publicly they have submitted such
letters in protest over her Brexit negotiating strategy.
However, the 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady is the only
person who knows how many have done so, including those who have
written to him confidentially.
    Brady was reported as saying this month that some MPs have
claimed to have submitted letters, when if fact they had not.  
    
    - What will happen during a confidence vote?
    All Conservative MPs could vote for or against their leader.
   If May wins she remains in office and cannot be challenged
again for 12 months. If she loses, she must resign and is barred
from standing in the leadership election that follows.
    
    - How quickly can a no confidence vote take place?
    Under Conservative rules, the 1922 Committee chairman in
consultation with the party leader decides the date of a vote,
to be held as soon as possible.
    In the last no confidence vote against a Conservative leader
in 2003 - when the party was in opposition - it was held the day
after the 1922 Committee chairman announced he had received
enough letters to trigger the vote.

    - What would happen if May lost a confidence vote? 
    If May lost a confidence vote there would be a leadership
contest to decide her replacement. However, a general election
would not automatically be triggered, and her replacement would
become prime minister.
    If several candidates come forward, a secret vote is held
among Conservative MPs to whittle down the field. The candidate
with the fewest votes is removed and another ballot among
Conservative lawmakers is held. The process is repeated until
two candidates remain, with votes held several days apart on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.    
    The final two candidates are then put to a postal ballot of
the wider Conservative Party membership, with the winner named
the new leader. Voters need to have been party members for more
than three months.
    When David Cameron decided to step down as prime minister
and Conservative leader after the EU referendum in 2016, five
candidates came forward. The field was narrowed to May and
then-junior minister Andrea Leadsom but she pulled out before
members voted, leaving May to become leader unopposed.

    - Who could replace May?
    The list of possible replacements is long, but there is no
clear frontrunner. Many of those expected to run used the
Conservative Party's annual conference this month to set out
their platform and priorities for any leadership bid.

 (Adds N.Irish party on rebel Brexit amendment, sterling)
    By Kylie MacLellan and William James
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will
on Monday say that 95 percent of Britain's Brexit deal has been
agreed but repeat her opposition to a European Union proposal
for the Irish border, a major stumbling block, as criticism
within her party grows.
    Facing some of the fiercest attacks to date over her Brexit
plans after again failing to clinch a deal at an EU summit last
week, May will try to calm passions in parliament where her
strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU supporters alike.
    With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to
exit the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the
so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. 
    But May's attempt to unlock the talks by considering an
extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current
proposed end date of December 2020 has further riled both pro-
and anti-EU factions in her deeply split Conservative Party.
    The extent of opposition to her plans could be laid bare on
Wednesday when pro-Brexit lawmakers, including the Northern
Irish party that props up her minority government, plan to stage
a rebellion on a piece of legislation related to the province.  
 
    On Monday, in an attempt to highlight how much progress has
been made in over a year of talks with the EU, she will tell
parliament the government has reached agreement on everything
from Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks.
    ""Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal
Agreement and its protocols are now settled,"" May will say,
according to excerpts from her statement to parliament.
    ""The shape of the deal across the vast majority of the
Withdrawal Agreement is now clear.""
    But the deal - the terms of Britain's divorce - cannot be
signed off until the two sides settle on future management of
the border between Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland.
    British and EU leaders are both committed to keeping the
border open, a crucial aspect of the 1998 Good Friday peace deal
that ended decades of Irish sectarian bloodshed.
    The EU proposal - for Northern Ireland to remain in the
bloc's customs union - has been rejected by May as it would
potentially create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain,
something ruled out by Northern Ireland's DUP party.
    At an EU summit in Brussels last week, any agreement seemed
just as far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and
diplomats saying that May had offered nothing new to ease the
deadlock. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    Since then, her proposal to extend the transition period has
stoked anger among Conservative eurosceptics, who fear she is
leading Britain into a deal that will make Britain a ""vassal
state"" indefinitely - unable ever to fully leave the EU or to
forge its own free trade deals with other countries.
    
    NATIONAL INTEREST
    Critics of May used Britain's Sunday newspapers to
rhetorically savage the British leader, with unnamed rivals
using phrases such as ""assassination is in the air"".
    A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48
Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the
party's so-called ""1922 Committee"" of backbenchers to demand
such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent.
    Newspapers reported May had been summoned to address
Conservative lawmakers in a private meeting on Wednesday. The
Daily Telegraph said she had held a 90-minute conference call
with her top ministers on Sunday to try and shore up support.
    On Wednesday one prominent hardline Brexiteer, former junior
Brexit minister Steve Baker, will try to block the EU's backstop
plan by attaching amendments to legislation passing through
parliament that would effectively make the proposal illegal. 
    The Telegraph reported the DUP planned to join with 40
Conservative lawmakers to vote in support of the amendment.
May's spokesman responded that the government would look at the
amendment ""in the usual way"". [nL8N1X23VE]
    The scale of votes against the government could provide an
indication of how many may ultimately refuse to back any final
Brexit deal with the EU when it is voted on in parliament.
    Britain's sterling currency suffered its worst day in a
month on Monday as fears grew that the Irish border issue and
Conservative infighting would see May face a leadership
challenge.  [nL8N1X2283]
    May used a piece in Monday's Sun newspaper to stress that
the Brexit negotiations were not about her and her future.
    ""When I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit
negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for
me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family
and for the whole of the United Kingdom,"" she wrote.
    ""Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal
fortunes. They’re about the national interest - and that means
making the right choices, not the easy ones.""

    Slovenia, which only narrowly avoided an international

    ""The latest ... forecasts of economic growth of Slovenia's
main trading partners indicate a solid rise of foreign demand
for the products of the Slovenian exports sector,"" the central
bank report said.
    Slovenia exports more than 65 percent of its production,
mainly to other European Union states. Main exports include
cars, car parts, pharmaceutical products and household
appliances.
    The monetary authority report cautioned, however, that
growth in investment by local companies was moderate due to
global uncertainties including trade conflicts, weak currencies
in some emerging market nations and Italy's public finance
problems.
    The bank urged the Slovenian government to keep a lid on
public spending as public debt remains high, expected to reach
70.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2018 versus 74.1 percent last
year. 
    It also highlighted persistent low labour productivity in
Slovenia, rising by only 1.9 percent on average over the past
two years and by only 1 percent in the first half of 2018.

Affairs said on Monday that a vote in the Macedonian parliament
that backed changing the country's name was rigged through a
combination of blackmail, threats and vote-buying.
    Macedonia's parliament on Friday approved a proposal to
change the country's name, bringing a decades-old dispute with

unblock its bid to join NATO, something Moscow opposes.

majority needed to enact constitutional changes had been secured
""through blackmail, and threatening and bribing opposition

    WILL Q3 EARNINGS BACK UP THE RETURN OF VALUE STOCKS NARRATIVE? (1529 GMT) 
    Good news for those who believe - and have bet in vain - that value stocks would make a
comeback in 2018 to end the era of growth and tech stocks supremacy. 
    ""Earnings results for Value stocks so far better than Growth"", Morgan Stanley analysts wrote
 in a European Equity Strategy note on the start of the earnings season.
    ""Value stocks have actually seen a net EPS beat, while Growth stocks have to date been the
source of disappointment"", they added, reminding that ""signs of an improvement in relative
earnings momentum"" had convinced them to go bullish Value versus Growth in December. 
    The recent fall from grace of the FAANG's in the United States and of luxury stocks in
Europe has been music to the ears to investors who have seen their bet against growth fail to
deliver for most of 2018.  
    Sceptics will however continue to argue that value stocks are the cheapest for a reason and
that therefore, at least in theory, they are the most vulnerable in a market crash. 
    It's often the other way around: they outperform the most when bursts of optimism make them
look very undervalued.
    Let's let readers decide if this works to illustrate growth versus value:

    EUROPEAN SHARES HIT BY SUDDEN MOOD SWING ON ITALY (1359 GMT) 
    Everything seemed just nice and calm on European markets when all of a sudden, we noticed
that losses on Italian banks were dragging Milan down and that yields were starting to rise
again. Shortly after that, the STOXX was in the red and now down 0.35 percent.   
    No analysts we reached could provide a sole and definitive ""smoking gun"" for the reversal in
Italy, but here are a few interesting takes.
    ""These are roller coaster days. There was euphoria this morning and now we're back down to
earth. The truth is that nothing has really changed.... Probably someone has started to think
that Moody's rating move is not that positive after all,"" said Carlo Franchini, head of
institutional clients at Banca Ifigest in Milan.
     Italian yields got a boost on Monday after Moody's held off cutting the country's credit
rating outlook to negative. 
     ""Multiple research analysts were expecting a relief rally, but I think that we probably had
some profit taking as well,"" said Cyril Regnat, fixed income strategist at Natixis, noting ""the
probability of having a budget slippage next year is high."" 
    Ken Odeluga from City Index noted this story: Market turmoil forced Italy to tighten a bad
loan guarantee scheme as a possible driver of weakness. [nL8N1X237Q]
    ""This means bigger losses for banks, but market may be over-reacting,"" he wrote. 
    There's also a wider market context with the S&P 500 and the Dow opening in negative
territory, which is clearly not helping.

    ""WHAT WOULD MAKE US REVERSE OUR PREFERENCE FOR US OVER EUROPE?"" (1245 GMT)
    JP Morgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka are giving the old continent a (slim) chance. 
    Even though they've just confirmed their overweight U.S. vs European stocks, they look at
what could possibly help them change their mind, and - surprise, surprise - say earnings & Italy
play the key role.
    Their cautious view on the Italian outlook and expectations that the relative US/Europe
earnings trend is not going to reverse for the time being however means it's still too early to
make the jump. 
    ""We need clarity on Italy to buy into (the) Eurozone trade,"" they say.
    ""While the deterioration is unlikely to happen in a straight line, our concern is that
peripheral spreads will remain elevated, the new Italian government will stay confrontational
and the bond market will keep testing them,"" they add.
    ""We do not see European earnings outperforming the US in the near future, and have in our Q3
preview argued that upcoming results in Europe will be unhelpful,"" they note.

    AUTOS: SPICING IT UP WITH BREAKUPS (1132 GMT) 
    Fiat Chrysler's <FCHA.MI> 6.2 billion euros sale of high-tech parts-making unit Magneti
Marelli to KKR is quite a coup for the Italian-American carmaker's new boss Mike Manley and it's
by extension quite a big deal for the European automotive sector, which is deep in bear market
territory (about 30 pct). 
    The dismantling of conglomerates, from General Electric to Siemens, had been identified as a
tempting trade and trend for 2018 but had so far been a disappointment, in particular in the
telco and car industry.
    ""We are excited about longer term upside opportunities,"" Barclays analysts said in February
about the structural reviews unveiled by management teams at Daimler, Volkswagen and Continental
and amid rumours those German giants could follow the footsteps of the arguably successful
spin-off of Ferrari from Fiat Chrysler.
    One clear positive of the Marelli deal is that the divestment has been made at an
encouraging price and not through an IPO, which often seems like a last resort.
    ""While it is no secret that FCA has been intending to separate Marelli from its core
business, both the structure of the transaction, sale vs. spin-out, and the valuation are net
positives for investors in our view"", Evercore ISI analysts commented. 
    At the moment, Fiat Chrysler is up 5.3 percent and the whole European automotive sector is
running at about 0.7 percent, twice as fast as the general market.

    MORNING SNAPSHOT: UP BUT OFF HIGHS (0942 GMT)
    The news on the Italian rating front has provided some more relief to investors which,
combined with hopes of economic stimulus in China, has pushed the European markets back into
positive territory following three straight sessions in the red.
    After the initial buoyancy, however, main country benchmarks have come off highs,
illustrating how investors prefer to refrain from taking big risks as potential headwinds
abound.
    Italy -- which is just one of the possible problem areas -- is due to send a letter on its
budget to the EU Commission by noon today and despite the conciliatory remarks from Commissioner
Moscovici, expectations are running quite low, suggesting more volatility ahead.
    ""Investors are almost certain that Italy's reply to the EU is unlikely to suffice to stop
the EU Commission from rejecting the budget plan,"" says Alexander Aldinger at BayernLB.

    WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR: EUROPE SET TO SNAP 3-DAY LOSING STREAK (0651 GMT)
    European shares are expected to snap a three-day losing streak at the open today, helped by
deal-making activity and after Moody's kept its outlook on Italy at stable on Friday, while some
downbeat earning updates could weigh. Euro STOXX 50 futures are up 0.8 percent.
    Trade-hit automakers will be in focus after Fiat Chrysler agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli
unit for 6.2 billion euros, while German carmakers, hurt last week by Daimler's profit warning,
could find support after Merkel promised legislative changes to ward off the threat of air
pollution leading to driving bans. [nL3N1X229D] [nL8N1X10X0]
    Italian banks could be supported as bond yields dropped across the curve after Moody's kept
the Italy's sovereign ratings outlook stable while delivering an expected downgrade on Friday.

that European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter, while Philips saw its profit
rising less than expected, due to currency headwinds. [nS8N1WP004] [nL8N1X20NQ]
    This week 22 percent of the STOXX 600's market will have reported results. European earnings
are seen up 13.6 percent in the third quarter, while euro zone earnings are seen up 11.7

car maker agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli unit for $7.1 billion, while in results, Ryanair

    European shares are expected to open slightly higher today as earning updates continue to
roll in and investors await for further developments in Brexit negotiations following a big

budget discussions following Moody's downgrade on Friday [nL3N1WZ5VO].

    Over in Asia, shares pared early losses as Chinese stocks swung higher for a second session

concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit. [nL3N1X203D]

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 22: Fitch Ratings has assigned Sabadell España 
Dividendo Fund, which is managed by Sabadell Asset Management (Sabadell),a 
'Strong' Investment Manager QualityRating The Outlook is Stable.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The rating is driven by the fund's strong investment process that benefits from 
Sabadell 's deep knowledge of the Spanish equity market and the resources, scale 
and history of Sabadellas investment manager. The rating also reflects 
Sabadell's combination of experienced staff and technological and risk resources 
that are well-suited to the fund's requirements. The Stable Outlook reflects the 
continuity and stability of processes and resource.

The 'Strong' rating of Sabadell España Dividendo is based on the following 
category scores:

Investment Process: Strong

Investment Resources: Proficient

Risk Management: Strong

Investment Performance: Consistent

Company and Client Servicing: Strong

Fund Presentation

The fund is an equity fund domiciled in Spain and mainly invested in the Spanish 
stock market. Its investment strategy is mainly driven by a bottom-up approach 
with a top-down view and an ability to manage its overall equity exposure. It 
also can invest in less liquid companies such as small and mid-caps and in other 
regions such as in Portugal. It had EUR268 million assets under management (AUM) 
as end-August 2018.

Strong Investment Process

Fitch views the investment process as strong, driven by the depth of research on 
a focussed investible universe and also benefitting from the ability to manage 
the total exposure to equity market with strategic and tactical approaches. The 
research is purely fundamental, sourced from the bank's research teams and based 
on company visits. This is complemented by a top-down macroeconomic analysis to 
detect macro trends and assess market valuation. The investment process is 
biased towards mid and small caps.

Proficient Investment Resources

Fitch views Sabadell's investment staff as proficient, given the size of the 
investible universe, number of funds managed and the model portfolio process. 
Moreover, the head of equities has stepped back from direct portfolio-management 
responsibilities so that roles and responsibilities are more clearly defined and 
segregated. The team adopts a consensual approach. Technology resources provide 
an adequate fit to the fund's requirements.

Strong Risk Management

Fitch judgess the risk-management framework as sound. Risk management is 
conducted by an independent team based on daily and monthly risk-limit 
monitoring accompanied by defined escalation processes. The risk-management 
framework incorporates scenario analysis based on assumed equity volatility 
regimes and redemptions, value at risk (VaR) measurement, and stress testing.

Consistent Investment Performance

Fitch views the fund's realised performance as consistent with peers' and the 
fund's benchmark. The fund has outperformed both peers and its benchmark over 
the last three years to July 2018 but has suffered higher volatility. Fitch also 
took into account that the fund's more short-term performance measures are 
improving such as the Sharpe ratio and the maximum drawdown.

Strong Company and Client Servicing

Fitch views Sabadell as a strong company. Sabadell is a 100% subsidiary of Banco 
Sabadell, the fourth-largest private bank in Spain. It had EUR37 billion in 
AUM)at end-2017, and has been growing ahead of the market. It provides asset 
management across all main asset classes, with the majority of its AUM in 
investment funds. Client servicing is of good quality, in our view.

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

The rating may be sensitive to material adverse changes to any of the 
aforementioned rating drivers, notably through weakened financial conditions, 
deterioration in performance, processes and policies. A material deviation from 
Fitch's guidelines for any key rating drivers could cause the rating to be 
downgraded.

    By Sinéad Carew
    NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were slightly lower
in choppy trade on Monday as some investors showed earnings
season nerves and the dollar strengthened, while long-dated U.S.
Treasury prices edged higher. 
    The U.S. dollar rose as the British pound fell on news that
Brexit negotiations with the European Union over Northern
Ireland remained in flux and as the euro continued its slide on
political uncertainty over Italy's budget. [nL8N1X244L]
    Falling stocks boosted demand for low-risk debt, though
gains were limited as investors remained on edge with rising
inflation pressures and further potential interest rate hikes by
the Federal Reserve. [nL2N1X212T]
    The third-quarter earnings season and U.S. midterm elections
also weighed on investor enthusiasm, along with the rising
dollar, according to money managers. 
    ""People are looking at the negatives and saying that it's a
situation where there are more headwinds. At least until the
midterms, it's going to be difficult to make any significant
progress on the upside. The drift will be lower,"" said Alan
Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment
advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 65.74 points,
or 0.26 percent, to 25,378.6, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 5.67
points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,762.11 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 42.44 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,491.46.
       
    U.S. EARNINGS
    Investors looked ahead to the peak week for the U.S.
earnings season, with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and
Caterpillar among the companies reporting. [nL2N1WY22W]
    Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P
500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the
third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
    ""There's some nervousness ahead of that,"" said Paul Nolte,
portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.3 percent, with the euro
<EUR=> down 0.41 percent to $1.1466. [USD/] 
    Sterling <GBP=>, meanwhile, slipped 0.8 percent against the
dollar. British Prime Minister Theresa May said the majority of
Britain's deal to exit the EU has been agreed upon but repeated
her opposition to an EU proposal regarding the Irish border,
according to excerpts from her statement to Parliament. 
[nL8N1X2283]
    Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> last rose
3/32 in price to yield 3.1902 percent, from 3.202 percent late
on Friday.
    Brazilian stocks were the biggest gainers in Latin America, 
with emerging market sentiment boosted as China promised to
provide stimulus to stabilize its economy and offset the impact
of U.S. tariffs. [nL2N1X20M5]
    Oil trading was choppy, with U.S. crude <CLcv1> futures
settling at $69.17 per barrel, up 5 cents, or 0.07 percent.
Brent <LCOcv1> settled at $79.83 per barrel, up 5 cents, or 0.06
percent. [O/R]
    Spot gold <XAU=> dropped 0.3 percent to $1,221.97 an ounce. 
    After rising as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the day,
European stocks <.STOXX> ended lower as relief over Moody's
decision to keep Italy's sovereign rating outlook stable was
short-lived and the focus turned to Europe's response to Rome's
budget plans. [.EU] [nL8N1X21L1]
    Asian stocks rose after China promised to stabilize its
economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. [nZZN2RF800]
    In China, Shanghai blue chips <.CSI300> gained 4.3 percent
in their biggest one-day gain since November 2015, after Beijing
promised stimulus support for stock markets in the world's
second-largest economy. [nL3N1X206H][L3N1X21FI]

    ORTENBERG, Germany, Oct 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor
Angela Merkel on Monday called the killing of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a ""monstrosity"" and
vowed to halt all German arms exports to Riyadh until the case
is cleared up.
    Merkel, in her harshest comments to date, decried what she
called ""the monstrosity there in the Saudi consulate in Turkey""
during a campaign rally in the town of Ortenberg before a
regional election in the state of Hesse on Sunday.
    ""It must be cleared up. As long as it's not cleared up,
there will be no arms exports to Saudi Arabia. I assure you of
that very decidedly,"" Merkel said.
    Riyadh has given multiple and conflicting accounts on what
led to Khashoggi's death on Oct. 2. On Sunday, Foreign Minister
Adel al-Jubeir called the killing a ""huge and grave mistake"" but
sought to shield Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince.
[nL8N1X10M8]
    Merkel first called for a stop to arms exports on Sunday,
raising questions about whether that would also affect
deliveries that had previously been approved. Her spokesman told
reporters earlier on Monday the question was being reviewed.
    Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's conservatives and
head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said it was
clear that all deliveries of weapons to Saudi Arabia should be
halted, even those approved before Khashoggi's death.
    ""Even those deals that were already approved cannot happen
now, as long as the case has not been resolved, and as long as
there have been no substantial consequences in Riyadh,"" Roettgen
told broadcaster ZDF. ""We would completely lose our
credibility.""
    Economy Minister Peter Altmaier earlier had called on other
European Union member states to follow its example in stopping
arms exports to Saudi Arabia to increase pressure on Riyadh over
the Khashoggi case.
    Riyadh's explanations so far had not been satisfactory,
Altmaier told broadcaster ZDF, adding, ""The government is in
agreement that we will not approve further arms exports for the
moment because we want to know what happened.""
    So far this year Berlin had approved weapons exports worth
more than 400 million euros ($462 million) to Saudi Arabia,
making it the second-biggest recipient of German arms after
Algeria.
    Asked whether Germany would roll back previously agreed arms
deals with Saudi, he said a decision would be made very soon.
The EU needed a unified position to avoid some countries filling
the gap, he added.

    WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Three weeks after Jamal
Khashoggi went missing, U.S. and key European security agencies
still have an incomplete picture of what role Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman may have played in the Saudi journalist's
disappearance and death.    
    Six U.S. and Western officials said on Monday they believe
the prince, who is Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, is ultimately
responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance due to his role
overseeing the Saudi security apparatus but they lack hard
proof.
    Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a Washington Post
columnist, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on
Oct. 2 by a team of Saudi agents and his body cut up. 
    Saudi Arabia said on Saturday the 59-year-old was killed in
a fight in the consulate. A Saudi official later told Reuters 15
Saudi nationals sent to Turkey to confront Khashoggi had
threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed
him in a chokehold when he resisted. 
    The Western security officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they are far from having a complete picture of
what happened to the Saudi columnist. They do not know how he
died and where his body was taken.         
    Despite extensive news leaks alleging that Turkey has audio
recordings documenting Khashoggi's torture and murder, as of
Monday neither U.S. nor allied government agencies had been
granted access to such evidence, the officials said.
    For Western allies of Saudi Arabia, a main question in the
Khashoggi death is whether they believe that Prince Mohammed,
who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. 
    U.S. President Donald Trump last week said the prince
""totally"" denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance.
    The Western government experts' confidence that Prince
Mohammed had some responsibility for the operation relies
heavily on their assessment of the dominant role he plays in
running the Saudi government, said two sources familiar with
intelligence reports.
    “Difficult to say MBS did not know about this,” a Western
security source said.
    But U.S. and allied intelligence reporting that details any 
specific instructions the crown prince might have issued about
the Khashoggi incident is not conclusive, the sources said.     
     
    This leaves open questions such as whether the Saudi
operation in Istanbul was always intended to result in
Khashoggi's death or whether the original plan was to kidnap and
transport him to Saudi Arabia.     
    Trump said on Monday he was still not satisfied with what he
has heard from Saudi Arabia about the killing. [nL8N1X24DL]     
    “I spoke to the Crown Prince. We have people over in Saudi
Arabia now. We have top intelligence people in Turkey. We're
going to see what we have. I'll know a lot tomorrow."" Trump
said.       
    Turkish officials provided U.S. and Western officials with
verbal accounts of evidence they say they collected documenting
Khashoggi's fate, the officials said. 
    One European security source said the information Turkey has
shared verbally is ""very detailed and they sound confident."" 
    The United States and its allies also have some independent
intelligence reporting supporting media reports that Khashoggi
was murdered inside the consulate by a military squad sent from
Saudi Arabia to Istanbul, two sources said.

Tuesday, dropping from last session's one-week high and snapping
two days of gains which were triggered by expectations of strong
demand in top consumer China.
    Aluminium rose for a second session as the market was
underpinned by lower global production.
    
    FUNDAMENTALS
    * Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange <CMCU3>
eased 0.1 percent to $6,236.50 a tonne by 0141 GMT after
climbing on Monday to its highest since Oct. 15 at $6,331.50 a
tonne. The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange <SCFcv1> was unchanged at 50,370 yuan ($7,256) a tonne.
    * Copper prices rose in the last two sessions after
authorities in China said they would take measures aimed at
bolstering growth and liquidity.
    * China's central bank governor said last week it would roll
out targeted measures to help ease company financing problems
and encourage commercial banks to boost lending to private
firms. 
    * China's tax cuts next year could exceed the equivalent of
1 percent of gross domestic product, a central bank adviser
said, in a sign policymakers might be considering another round
of tax reductions. 
    * China's economic growth cooled to its weakest quarterly
pace since the global financial crisis, with regulators moving
quickly to calm nervous investors as a years-long campaign to
tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States began
to bite. [nL3N1WZ25R]
    * The global world refined copper market showed a 47,000
tonnes deficit in July, compared with a 38,000 tonnes deficit in
June, the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) said in its
latest monthly bulletin. [nEONIAF0SK]
    * For the first 7 months of the year, the market was in a
157,000 tonnes deficit compared with a 188,000 tonnes deficit in
the same period a year earlier, the ICSG said.
    * Global primary aluminium output fell to 5.301 million
tonnes in September from a revised 5.485 million tonnes in
August, data from the International Aluminium Institute showed
on Monday.
    * Aluminium <CMAL3> rose 0.2 percent to $2,010 a tonne.

    SINGAPORE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen, a safe haven
in uncertain times, firmed against the dollar on Tuesday, as the
euro and sterling suffered due to doubts over Italy's budget
spending and over British Prime Minister Theresa May's future
with Brexit talks stalled.
    The dollar weakened 0.21 in Asian trade to <JPY=> trade at
112.55 yen <JPY=>, gaining as risk-shy investors retreated from
Asia's main share markets. [nL3N1X3077]
    The sterling <GBP=> traded flat at $1.2960 on Tuesday,
having lost 0.83 percent on Monday, its steepest fall in
percentage terms since Sept. 21. The pound has lost 2.2 percent
versus the greenback in the last seven trading sessions.
     With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to
exit the EU, Brexit talks have hit an impasse, sparking
speculation that May could be toppled by rebels in her
Conservative Party. [nL8N1X2283] [nL8N1X21VU]
    The euro <EUR=> eased marginally to $1.1453 on Tuesday, as
concern over Italy's free spending budget drove sentiment. The 
single currency failed to draw relief from a fall in Italian
10-year bond yields on Monday. The benchmark Italian 1-year
yield <IT10YT=RR> declined by 3 percent on Monday, its steepest
fall in percentage terms since Oct. 3.
     Moody's downgraded the Italian credit rating because of the
government's spending plans on Friday but surprisingly kept the
outlook stable. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    ""Tensions are likely to heighten between Rome and Brussels,
especially if the European Council launch an 'Excessive Deficit
Procedure' against Italy,"" said Philip Wee, currency strategist
at DBS in a note.
     ""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective
action to rein in its large public debt, currently at 130
percent of GDP vs the 60 percent Maastricht rule,"" added Wee. 
     The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value versus six
major peers, traded flat at 96.02 on Tuesday.
    ""The dollar is still expected to retain the upper hand given
that potential negatives across the other majors remain readily
available. The dollar index may therefore continue to test 
96.00 for a sustained breach to detach above its 200-week moving
average of 95.792 on a multi-session basis,"" said OCBC analysts
in a note. 
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> lost 0.16 percent versus the
greenback on Tuesday, changing hands at 0.7069. It lost 0.57
percent on Monday.

    EUROPEAN SHARES SET FOR NEW LOWS AS FUTURES FALL (0608 GMT) 
    Futures have just started trading and they are well unequivocally in the red, meaning that
benchmarks such as Germany's DAx or the STOXX 600 are likely to touch lows from up to two years

    LOWS NOT SEEN IN A LONG TIME IN SIGHT AT THE OPEN (0557 GMT) 
    Depending on how bad the open is, there are plenty of indexes which are likely to touch
levels not seen for as long as two years.  
    The STOXX 600 is close to its December 2016 lows, the STOXXE is near February 2017 levels
and Paris' CAC 40 is in touching distance of March 2018 and August 2017.

    MORNING CALL: NOT MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO (0522 GMT) 
    Financial spreadbetters expect European stock markets to open in negative territory and why
wouldn't they? Asian markets are closing deep into negative territory after the S&P and the Dow
also ended lower.
    It's fair to say that the earnings season hasn't fully reassured investors who are facing a
toxic cocktail of negative drivers, from Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to concerns over
Italy's budget and Brexit talks.
    At the moment we have London's FTSE at 40 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 108 points and
Paris' CAC to lose 31 points lower at 5,022.

    EARNINGS TO THE RESCUE (0645 GMT) 
    Will today's harvest of Q3 earnings be sweet enough to offset the toxic bitterness of 
Brexit talks, Italian budget angst, Saudi isolation, trade wars, Chinese growth slowing down and
the fear of U.S. interest rates rising faster than expected? 
    It does not look like it and with European futures trading deep in the red, Paris' CAC 40,
Germany’s DAX and the STOXX benchmarks are likely to touch lows not seen since as long as two
years. 
    In the bearish automotive sector, bad news from Saab, which announced a rights issue and is
expected to post heavy losses at the open. Renault announced revenues fell 6 percent. In another
bearish sector, banking, Swedbank net profit beat forecast.
    It’s not looking good for money manager GAM, which is seeing an asset exodus. Other bell
weathers for the region include Dutch staffing Randstad.       
    Good earnings in tech lifted the Nasdaq on Monday and it is yet to be seen if the sector can
lift Europe too. Computer accessory firm Logitech confirmed its 2019 outlook after rising sales
while France's Atos and Ingenico lowered their outlooks. 
    Innate Pharma may also get a boost after Britain AstraZeneca bought a stake in the French
drugmaker.

    LOWS NOT SEEN IN A LONG TIME IN SIGHT AT THE OPEN (0557 GMT) 
    Depending on how bad the open is, there are plenty of indexes which are likely to touch
levels not seen for as long as two years.  
    The STOXX 600 is close to its December 2016 lows, the STOXXE is near February 2017 levels
and Paris' CAC 40 is in touching distance of March 2018 and August 2017. 
    Germany's DAX is close to February 2017 and even December 2016 lows:

    MORNING CALL: NOT MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO (0522 GMT) 
    Financial spreadbetters expect European stock markets to open in negative territory and why
wouldn't they? Asian markets are closing deep into negative territory after the S&P and the Dow
also ended lower.
    It's fair to say that the earnings season hasn't fully reassured investors who are facing a
toxic cocktail of negative drivers, from Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to concerns over
Italy's budget and Brexit talks.
    At the moment we have London's FTSE at 40 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 108 points and
Paris' CAC to lose 31 points lower at 5,022.

    ROME, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Italy's coalition government is
prepared to adjust its contested 2019 budget should markets
react negatively and the spread between 10-year government bond
yields and German yields spike, the newspaper Il Messaggero
reported on Tuesday.
    On Monday, the government said it would stick to its plans,
though acknowledging that its budget, which would raise next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, was not
in line with the EU Stability and Growth Pact. [nL8N1X22UD] 
    The newspaper did not say whether the alternative budget
would lower the deficit to less than 2.4 percent of GDP. It did
say the alternative would not entail an exit from the euro.
    The European Commission had already sent Rome a warning
letter about the budget last week, the first formal step that
could lead to Brussels rejecting the measures and imposing
fines. The Commission is expected to decide its next step on
Tuesday. 
    The government's ""plan B"" would involve redefining
retirement measures and basic income for the poor, two key
points of its expansionary budget, Il Messagero reported,
without giving details of its sources.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month
low on Tuesday before a meeting by the European Commission on
Italy's budget that could see Brussels take the unprecedented
step of rejecting it and demanding changes.
    A dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the
leadership of Britain's prime minister, mired in a stalemate
over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the likelihood of
further political turmoil in Europe. 
    That contributed to broad risk aversion on Tuesday, with the
safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening while
higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell.
    Worries about Italy's spending has bred some doubt about the
European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates next summer
and that has hurt the euro. On Tuesday,it fell 0.2 percent to
$1.4390, nearing a two-month low of $1.4325 hit on Oct. 9.
<EUR=EBS>  
    Italy's bond yields ticked up on Tuesday before the meeting.
Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance
ministers, said on Monday he was confident an agreement could be
reached.
    ""The prospect of a normalisation of monetary policy was the
main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past
year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now
going to crumble,"" Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    Tensions are likely to heighten between Rome and Brussels,
especially if the European Council launch an ""Excessive Deficit
Procedure"" against Italy, said Philip Wee, currency strategist
at DBS in a note.
    ""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective
action to rein in its large public debt, currently at 130
percent of GDP vs the 60 percent Maastricht rule,"" Wee said.
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against six
other major currencies, rose to a two-month high of 96.158 and
traded up 0.1 percent. 
    That was due to the turbulence in Europe continent and
expectations that a strong U.S. economy may see the Federal
Reserve raise rates faster than assumed. 
    Britain's pound traded up 0.2 percent at $1.3 after falling
on Monday on fears that the Irish border issue and disagreements
within Britain's ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see
Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge.
[nL8N1X2283] 
    ""Whispers of a growing number of Tory MP rebels losing their
patience with May have put the risks of a lengthy UK political
impasse and a Brexit policy mistake (exiting the EU without a
deal) back on the table,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency
strategist at ING.
    ""We think this noise is likely to keep the pound on the back
foot this week,"" he said.
    The dollar weakened 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen
<JPY=D3> to trade at 112.32 yen, gaining as risk-shy investors
retreated from Asia's main share markets. [nL3N1X3077]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=D3> lost 0.1 percent versus the
U.S. dollar on Tuesday, changing hands at 0.7089. It lost 0.6
percent on Monday.

    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire
British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, has chosen to
build his electric car in Singapore to be close to Asian
customers, supply chains and a highly skilled workforce.
    The 71-year-old entrepreneur, who backed Brexit in the 2016
referendum, is pumping 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) into the
launch of an electric car, with a 400-strong British-based
engineering team working in secret for the first 2 1/2 years on
the project.
    Dyson is looking to exploit his company's expertise in
solid-state battery technology and electric motors that are
found in his innovative vacuum cleaners and other products like
bladeless fans and air purifiers. 
    Dyson was a prominent backer of Britain's vote to leave the
European Union. He has argued that Britain's future lies in
building close ties with fast growing markets in Asia, and not
Europe. 
    ""The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on
supply chains, access to markets, and the availability of the
expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions,"" Dyson Chief
Executive Jim Rowan said. 
    The company has announced plans to invest 200 million pounds
in new buildings and a testing track at its campus in Wiltshire,
western England.
    One of Britain's most successful engineering companies, it
already employs 1,100 people in Singapore, where it makes
digital electric motors.  
    A new two-storey purpose-build production manufacturing
facility is due to be completed in Singapore in 2020, with the
first cars on course to be launched in 2021.

    Not to rub salt into the wound of an already painful session but it's just impossible to

    EUROPE PAINTED RED: ""THE SELL-OFF HAS RESUMED"" (0908 GMT)
    All major country indexes, all sectors but one (the defensive utilities) and 90 percent of
European stocks are falling this morning with the pan-regional STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark
firmly anchored at its lowest level since December 2016.
    ""The sell-off has resumed,"" says Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades in London. 
   
    ""The European sell-off is accentuated by the worrisome Italian crisis as the EU has now
raised its monitoring of Italian banks' liquidity, and this uncertainty is not pushing stock
traders go long on EU stocks.""
    Clearly worries over the Italian outlook and the mix of other global risk is pushing
investors away from stocks and towards safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese Yen,
although there are signs that cheap valuations are starting to lure some investors back.
    ""Personally I think that European equities look attractive at these levels, especially if
there's going to be an economic rebound in China over the coming months. The Italian situation
however needs to stabilise somewhat and it's not clear how it will, until the clash (between the
Italian government) and the EU lasts,"" says Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.

    Will today's harvest of Q3 earnings be sweet enough to offset the toxic bitterness of 
Brexit talks, Italian budget angst, Saudi isolation, trade wars, Chinese growth slowing down and
the fear of U.S. interest rates rising faster than expected? 
    It does not look like it and with European futures trading deep in the red, Paris' CAC 40,
Germany’s DAX and the STOXX benchmarks are likely to touch lows not seen since as long as two
years. 
    In the bearish automotive sector, bad news from Saab, which announced a rights issue and is
expected to post heavy losses at the open. Renault announced revenues fell 6 percent. In another
bearish sector, banking, Swedbank net profit beat forecast.
    It’s not looking good for money manager GAM, which is seeing an asset exodus. Other bell
weathers for the region include Dutch staffing Randstad.       
    Good earnings in tech lifted the Nasdaq on Monday and it is yet to be seen if the sector can

firm Budimex <BDXP.WA> has become the first in its sector to
offer cash incentives to anyone who helps it find new workers at
a time of the lowest unemployment in decades, the company said
on Tuesday.
    Almost half of Polish companies in Poland face problems
finding new employees, a report showed in August. [nL8N1VC2CC] 
    The construction industry has been particularly affected, as
infrastructure funding from the European Union has driven growth
at a time that it has been losing workers to higher-paying EU
markets such as Germany and Britain. 
    ""We are the largest employer in the construction market in
Poland and a responsible employer,"" Budimex said in a statement.
""We were one of the few companies on the market that did not
reduce employment in 2014-2016 when the construction industry
faced a reduction in the number of orders.""
    The company, which recruits through agencies, internal
recommendations and job advertisements, said it will now pay up
to 2,000 zlotys  ($534.00) to anyone who helps it employ a
worker for a specific job. 
    ""We are currently looking for specialized construction
managers, engineers and masters in many branches, especially in
the field of rail and buildings construction,"" Budimex said. 
     The company has increased its average pay for manual
workers by 20 percent over the last year, it said. 
    Budimex, which is owned by Spain's Ferrovial <FER.MC>, said
it plans to hire 1,100 workers by the end of 2019. The group has
already increased employment to more than 7,000 people from
4,500 four years ago. 
    It mostly employs Polish workers but last year started
hiring foreign staff, mostly from Ukraine, as Poland struggles
to compete with other European Union countries in attracting EU
workers.
    The unemployment rate in Poland, which has one of the
fastest aging societies in the European Union, has for months
been the lowest since 1990, at 5.7 percent in September.
[nW8N1WH00F]
    Poland's construction industry needs an extra 100,000
workers to handle a surge in public sector projects and save
more companies from bankruptcy, Budimex's chief executive told
Reuters in June. [nL5N1T646V]

    THE BULL MARKET IS DYING, BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET... (1040 GMT)
    Kepler Cheuvreux strategist Christopher Potts says October is the cruellest month, and the
sell-off we're seeing is proving him quite right. Still he believes that there's going to be one
more rally through November and December before U.S. monetary policy normalisation makes a
decisive move to knock down this long bull market. 
    ""The year-end rally in equity will contain the seeds of its own destruction because it
should be accompanied by a further upward move in yields of quality developed debt,"" says Potts.
""The signal should be given when we see yields at the short end of the Treasury curve trading
above the 3 percent threshold. One further increase in the funds rate by the Fed is required,
which we assume will be delivered on the eve of Christmas,"" he warns.
    So, in practical terms, how far can stock markets rally before the D-day of December's FOMC
meeting? Potts thinks major developed markets have a 5-8 percent upside potential, with the S&P
500 <.SPX> eventually returning to the 2,900 threshold and the EuroSTOXX50 <.STOXX50E> climbing
to 3,340-3,380 zone.

 (Adds details, quotes)
    By Paul Sandle
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire
British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, has chosen to
build his electric car in Singapore to be close to Asian
customers, supply chains and a highly skilled workforce.
    The 71-year-old entrepreneur, who backed Brexit in the 2016
referendum, already manufactures products such as hair dryers,
air purification systems and bladeless fans in Asia, while its
research and development remains in Britain.
    One of the best-known engineering companies in the United
Kingdom, Dyson announced a $2.6 billion move into electric cars
last year after a 400-strong British-based engineering team
spent the first 2-1/2 years working on the project in secret. 
    ""The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on
supply chains, access to markets, and the availability of the
expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions,"" Dyson Chief
Executive Jim Rowan said.
    Carmakers are stepping up investment in electric vehicles in
response to ever-tightening emissions restrictions and penalties
on the use of internal combustion engines, with some countries
already promising outright bans. 
    Dyson is looking to exploit its ability in solid-state
battery technology and electric motors that are found in its
innovative vacuum cleaners and other products. 
    James Dyson told reporters last year that his ambition to go
it alone was driven by the car industry's dismissal of an idea
he had of applying his cyclonic technology that revolutionised
vacuum cleaners to handle diesel emissions in car exhaust
systems in the 1990s.
    The inventor was a prominent backer of Britain's vote to
leave the European Union and has argued that Britain's future
lies in building close ties with fast-growing markets in Asia,
and not Europe.
    Singapore is a densely populated city-state and one of the
world's most expensive places to own a car. 
    It controls vehicle population through a system of bidding
for the right to own and use a vehicle for a limited number of
years. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla <TSLA.O>, criticised
Singapore for not being supportive of electric vehicles earlier
this year.
    But the city state has trade agreements with China and Japan
and Dyson CEO Rowan said the comparatively high cost base would
be offset by its technology expertise and focus.  
    ""It is therefore the right place to make high-quality
technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our
electric vehicle,"" he said.    
    Dyson started its work on the electric car in Wiltshire,
western England, where it is investing 200 million pounds  ($260
million) in new buildings and a testing track at its campus. 
    In Singapore, where it already employs 1,100 people to build
digital electric motors, it will build a new two-storey
production manufacturing facility, with the first cars set to be
launched in 2021.

    By Teis Jensen and Erik Matzen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Denmark's Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA) needs to establish whether Danske
Bank <DANSKE.CO> intentionally misled it over possible money
laundering at its Estonian branch, the country's business
minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Tuesday.
    Danske is embroiled in a scandal involving 200 billion euros
($230 billion) in payments through its Estonian branch between
2007 and 2015, many of which Denmark's biggest bank said in a
report last month it thinks are suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    ""It's one thing if they have not known themselves what
happened in the Estonian branch, but if they deliberately have
held back grave information, then it goes from being serious to
being deeply serious,"" Jarlov told a meeting of the Danish
parliament's business committee. 
    ""This is what the FSA is investigating now,"" Jarlov said,
adding that this would shed light on who was liable.
    If the FSA finds Danske deliberately gave wrong information
then it would hand the case over to Denmark's state prosecutor
for financial crime, Jarlov told Reuters.
    Danske, which declined to comment, said this month that it
had ""received requests for information from the U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) in connection with a criminal investigation
relating to the bank's Estonian branch"". [nL8N1WK1GP]
    Jarlov said Danish authorities were in contact with their
U.S. counterparts, adding that he was not allowed to elaborate
further on their dialogue. 
    Some investors are worried that the United States could hit
Danske, whose battered shares were down 2 percent to 128 Danish
crowns on Tuesday, with fines totalling billions of dollars.
    Jarlov told the parliamentary meeting that both the Danish
and Estonian regulators should have reacted sooner to the money
laundering allegations.

    * Centres need a makeover, now lack staff, technology

    * New benefit is most costly item in deficit-hiking budget 

    By Francesca Piscioneri
    NAPLES, Italy, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Outside the job centre in
a poor quarter of Naples in southern Italy, Emanuele Varriale
uses a ballpoint pen to fill in a form certifying he is looking
for work.
    But he has no hope that the centre will find him a job.
    Inside the dusty office, scores of people are completing the
same form, helped by five middle-aged employees working with
piles of folders and paper clips more than computers.    
    ""I have only come for the certificate"", says 26-year-old
Varriale, who lost his job in a fruit shop. ""My father has been
enrolled for 30 years and they've never offered him anything.""
    The certificate entitles Varriale to a temporary
unemployment cheque of a few hundred euros per month, linked to
his previous salary. But it could soon give him access to a far
more generous income of up to 780 euros ($894) under a new
welfare policy designed to lift 5 million Italians out of
poverty.
    The ""citizens' wage,"" championed by the governing 5-Star
Movement, will cost 10 billion euros next year, the most
expensive item in a big-spending budget which itself has raised
concerns in the European Union that Italy could be sowing the
seeds of a financial crisis.
    Italy's 550 state-run job centres will be in charge of
verifying that recipients of the new benefit meet an important
eligibility criteria: that they are actively looking for a job. 
    But Italians widely regard the centres as being blighted by
obsolete technology and insufficient and under-qualified staff,
creating fears they will be unable to verify that recipients are
genuinely looking for work and could encourage benefit cheats.
    Another concern is that they will fail in their most basic
task of advertising all job opportunities, raising the risk that
even industrious people will be funnelled into welfare simply
because they were not made aware of suitable vacancies.
    The new populist government plans to spend 1 billion euros
to modernise the centres -- 10 percent of the total cost of the
new policy in its first year in 2019. Critics say it is not
enough and that the wage will reward people for doing nothing.
    ""Lots of people will just sit on their couches because the
centres aren't equipped to offer jobs or to check that people
are searching for them,"" said Renato Brunetta, an opposition
politician, former minister and professor of labour economics.
    The 5-Star Movement used to bill the citizens' wage as a
basic-income policy -- an unconditional form of welfare -- but
imposed conditions to counter the charge that it would pay
people to be idle.
    Unlike a basic-income scheme that was tried and abandoned in
Finland, Italy will impose the job-seeker requirement for
everyone except retirees and those unable to work. It will be
means tested and will now more closely resemble income-support
schemes offered across the EU, though it will rank among the
more generous. 
    Direct comparisons are complicated, but the 780-euro maximum
amount available to a single person with no other income is
about double the 318 pounds ($412)available to someone aged 25
or over under Britain's universal credit scheme.
    Still, the citizens' wage has drawn scepticism from labour
experts who say the job centres are a weak link that is unlikely
to be fixed in the five months before it is rolled out.
    
    'HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE'
    Labour Minister Luigi Di Maio, head of the 5-Star party,
acknowledges the job centres are a ""humiliating experience"" for
the unemployed, but is staking his career on transforming them
into a high-tech network that can help people find jobs or
guarantee them training courses to improve their skills.
    If he fails, it could backfire on 5-Star, embarrass the new
government and erode a central pillar of the budget.
[nL8N1X22UD] [nL8N1WV1L6]
    Some 700 km (430 miles) north of Naples, a manager at a
successful glass-making firm near Venice says that when he needs
new staff the last place he turns to is the local job centre.
    ""The few times we tried, it was a dreadful experience,"" says
Alessandro Zanchetta, head of human resources at Somec, whose
400 workers make glass sheeting for ships and skyscrapers.
    The candidates sent by the centres always lacked the skills
Somec needed, Zanchetta said, adding that he now used private
agencies or head-hunters.
    In Italy, only 3 percent of unemployed people find work
through public job centres, compared to 20 percent in France and
Germany, according to the EU's statistics office, Eurostat.
Italy's centres employ 8,000 people, compared with 100,000 in
Germany and 45,000 in France. 
    Members of the workforce who receive the citizens' wage,
which is due to launch by March, must do eight hours of
community service per week and accept one of the first three job
offers for which they are qualified.
    ""We are working on a single software for all the job centres
that is able to cross-check databases,"" 5-Star leader Di Maio
told Reuters. ""In this way we will know who is receiving the
income, how he is being trained, how he is behaving and if he is
entitled to receive it again.""
    He has also launched a public competition to give the
centres a new design and logo.
    
    FEARS OF A 'TSUNAMI'
    Some labour experts, and some of the centre's employees, are
sceptical the system can be overhauled by March, saying that the
1 billion euros budgeted to upgrade them will not be enough.
    ""It's not clear how we can bring about this revolution in
such a short time,"" says Sonia Palmeri, head of employment
policy in the Campania region around Naples.
    ""We need to hire young and trained people, otherwise we will
be overwhelmed (by applicants) like a tsunami.""
    Michele Tiraboschi, professor of labour law at Modena
University, holds out even less hope.
    ""It's going to be a total failure,"" he said. ""In Italy the
job centres never worked, not even after World War Two when the
State had the monopoly of the labour market."" 
    The average age of job-centre employees is 50, and only 26
percent have a university degree, according to a survey by
Italy's national agency for labour market policies. Fifty
percent said their computer systems were inadequate. In Italy's
poor south, 17 percent of job centre staff held a degree.
    In the south, where most people do not work and many others
toil in the shadows of the black economy, the wage is so eagerly
awaited that some residents have already tried to claim it.
[nL8N1Q44DV]
    ""I came for the citizens' wage but they told me to come back
in 2019,"" Cuono Orto, a 54-year-old unemployed builder, said
despondently as he left the job centre in Naples.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 23: Fitch Ratings has upgraded the two rated 
tranches of Pontormo S.r.l. (Series 2017) as follows:

Class A1 (IT0005315210): upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'AA-sf'; Outlook Negative

Class A2 (IT0005315228): upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'AA-sf'; Outlook Negative

This is a multi-originator RMBS transaction originated and serviced by Banca 
Cambiano 1884 S.p.a. and Banca di Pisa e Fornacette Credito Cooperativo 
S.c.p.a., two small regional banks located in Tuscany.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Credit Enhancement Build-up

The upgrade follows an increase in credit enhancement (CE) available to the 
rated notes. CE is provided by the subordination of the junior notes and 
amortising cash reserves; CE has built up to 26.4% currently, up from 23.2% at 
closing in November 2017, benefitting from the natural amortisation of the 
underlying portfolio and a high annualised prepayment rate of about 8%. 

Commingling Risk Immaterial 

Collections from the portfolio are transferred on the same day of collection 
from the accounts of the servicers to the accounts held by the issuer at the 
account bank. Therefore, in line with Fitch's counterparty risk rating criteria, 
commingling risk is assessed as immaterial and no commingling loss has been 
sized in our analysis.

Negative Outlook Linked To Sovereign 

Italian securitisations can achieve a maximum rating of 'AAsf', six notches 
above Italy's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR; BBB/Negative/F2). Therefore, 
the Negative Outlook on the rated notes reflects that of the sovereign IDR.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Changes to Italy's Long-Term IDR and the rating cap for Italian structured 
finance transactions, currently 'AAsf', could trigger rating changes to the 
rated tranches.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has 
received about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There were 
no findings that affected the rating analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the 
results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio information or 
conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring.

Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party 
assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information and concluded that there 
were no findings that affected the rating analysis.

Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted 
sample of the originators' origination files and found the information contained 
in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originators' policies 
and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset 
portfolio.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's 
rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that 
it is adequately reliable.

    By Alissa de Carbonnel
    STRASBOURG, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission
rejected on Tuesday Italy's draft 2019 budget because the plan
breaks EU rules in an ""unprecedented"" way and asked Rome to
submit a new one within three weeks or it would face
disciplinary action
    The decision by the European Union executive arm is the
first time it exercises the power, obtained during the sovereign
debt crisis in 2013, to send back a budget of a euro zone
country that violates the rules.
    ""Today, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to
request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,""
Commission Vice President for the Euro Valdis Dombrovskis told a
news conference. 
    ""But we see no alternative than to request the Italian
government to do so. We have adopted an opinion giving Italy a
maximum of three weeks to provide a revised draft budgetary plan
for 2019,"" Dombrovskis said.
    The Commission said that the revised budget it expected to
receive from Italy should be in line with the recommendation of
EU finance ministers from July 13.
    In July, EU ministers asked Rome to cut its structural
deficit, which excludes one-offs and business cycle swings, by
0.6 percent of GDP. The plan rejected by the Commission
increases that deficit by 0.8 percent of GDP.
    Italy sent a letter to the Commission on Monday, 
acknowledging that its draft budget was in violation of EU
rules, but insisting it would still go ahead with it.
    ""The Italian Government is openly and consciously going
against the commitments it made,"" Dombrovskis said.
    Dombrovskis said that Italy had the second highest debt to
GDP ratio in the EU at 131.2 percent in 2017 and the highest
debt servicing costs in Europe. 
    ""Italy's interest expenditure stood in 2017 at around 65.5
billion euros or 3.8 percent of GDP, which was broadly the same
amount of public resources devoted to education,"" the Commission
said. Italy believes that its additional spending measure would
boost economic growth, helping reduce the debt to GDP ratio.
    But the Commission said the growth assumptions were overly
optimistic, which also made Italy's debt reduction questionable.
    ""Experience has shown time and again that higher fiscal
deficits and debt do not bring lasting growth. And excessive
debt makes your economy more vulnerable to future crisis,""
Dombrovskis said.
    ""Therefore, if looser fiscal policy affects confidence, it
can actually have the opposite effect to growth,"" he said.
    Dombrovskis noted, that unless Rome changes its draft budget
in the next 3 weeks, the Commission was ready to open a
disciplinary process against the country, called the excessive
deficit procedure, based on the lack of progress in cutting debt
-- an obligation under EU law.
    ""In May, the European Commission did not propose opening an
Excessive Deficit Procedure related to debt, mostly because of
Italy’s broad compliance with its commitments,"" Dombrovskis said
of a procedure that could entail fines.
    ""The current plans are a material change, which may require
a reassessment of that conclusion. The ball is now in the court
of the Italian government,"" he said.

    ATHENS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - National Bank (NBG), Greece's
second-largest lender will ask European Union competition
authorities for more time to complete planned asset sales under
an EU-approved restructuring plan, two bankers close to the
matter said.
    NBG <NBGr.AT> has been selling assets in the Balkans,
including operations in Bulgaria, Albania, Romania and Turkey,
as it downsizes to focus on its core domestic banking business.
    But it needs more time to complete the divestments beyond
the end-2018 deadline previously agreed with EU authorities.
    Those assets include subsidiaries in Cyprus, Romania and the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as NBG's
insurance arm.
    Last week NBG ended talks with Shanghai-based Gongbao Group
on the sale of a majority stake in its wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary. A previous effort to sell the business to U.S. and
Dutch investors fell through in March. [nL8N1WX1B2]
    Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised NBG on the sale of
its insurance business.
    ""Two months until the end of 2018 is potentially not enough
to complete the plan,"" one of the bankers, who declined to be
named, told Reuters on Tuesday. As a result, the issue has to be
officially referred to the Directorate-General of the EU
Commission, he added. 
   ""NBG is preparing a proposal on the time frame it wants to
conclude its divestments plan,"" the banker said. 
    In the proposal NBG will explain why the planned asset sales
haven't been completed and outline next steps, eyeing an
extended deadline.
    Apart from seeking the sale of a 75 percent stake in
National Insurance, NBG is looking for buyers for fully-owned
Stopanska Banka in Macedonia, which has around a 35 percent
market share. 
    It also plans to sell operations in Cyprus and restart the
process of selling Banca Romaneasca in Romania.
    NBG had clinched a deal to sell the subsidiary to a unit of
Hungary's OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> but Romania's central bank rejected
the deal in March. Credit Suisse was NBG's advisor on the sale.
    Banca Romaneasca has about a 2 percent market share in the
Romanian market.
    ""The aim is to sell the unit by the end of this year but it
may take longer, until the first half of 2019,"" the second
banker said. ""Players looking to acquire banks in the Romanian
market have already bought franchises there.""
    NBG has already sold its Bulgarian subsidiary UBB to Belgian
bank KBC and offloaded a small unit in South Africa. In July it
concluded the sale of NBG Albania to American Bank of
Investments after selling Vojvodjanska banka and NBG Leasing in
Serbia last year.

 (Updates prices, adds quote)
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Sterling briefly gained half a
percent against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after a media
report that the European Union could offer British Prime
Minister Theresa May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit
deal.
    The report by Ireland's RTE News followed a Reuters story on
Monday that EU negotiators were looking at ways to promise
Britain a customs deal. [nL8N1X250D]
    The pound's strength was only brief, however, and weakness
in late European trading reflected that the market remains
unconvinced May can successfully sell any deal to her
Conservative party colleagues and get it through parliament.
    EU diplomats have told Reuters that the bloc is examining 
ways to solve the Irish border problem by keeping the whole of
the United Kingdom, and not just Northern Ireland, inside the
EU’s customs territory. 
    This would be fully settled only in post-Brexit negotiations
– and the EU would set stricter terms than May offered. The EU
also still wants some element of special protection for Northern
Ireland in the treaty, although it may be only hypothetical. 
    ""It’s more of the positive news that things are progressing
in terms of the Irish border issue,"" said ING analyst Viraj
Patel, while adding some caution. ""Until the market sees a
politically viable Brexit deal, sterling is not really going to
hold to short term spikes or gains.""
    The pound rose from below $1.30 <GBP=D3> to as high as
$1.3044 after the RTE report, up 0.6 percent on the day, before
giving up most of the gains to trade at $1.2984 at 1435 GMT. 
    It also jumped versus the euro to as much as 87.995 pence
before easing back to 88.225 pence <EURGBP=D3>. 
    May's spokesman said on Tuesday that the British leader was
confident she could get a Brexit deal that will win the support
of parliament. [nS8N1TG02E]
    The prime minister had told parliament on Monday that the
Brexit deal with Brussels was 95 percent complete, and she urged
restive lawmakers to back her in the final stages of Britain's
exit from the EU, saying talks were in their most difficult
phase. [nL8N1X21VU]
    But opponents within her own party and in the opposition
have stepped up criticism of the deal she is trying to get, even
if an imminent challenge to May's leadership appears less
likely.
    ""The problem is simply that May's critics talk a tough game,
but when push comes to shove, they fold because it is not clear
that any challenger can muster the necessary votes to replace
May,"" said Marc C. Chandler, chief market strategist at
Bannockburn Global Forex.

    AMS -28%: UNFORGIVING MARKETS, ANALYSTS LESS SO (1500 GMT)
    Apple <AAPL.O> chip suppler AMS <AMS.S> is seeing over one fourth of its market cap being
wiped off in just one trading day after an update that was clearly disappointing. [nL8N1X25PX]
    Still the magnitude of the drop - on track for its worst day since January 2008 - looks more
like an illustration of how markets, plagued by a broad range of risks, have become merciless,
rather than a straight reaction to poor numbers.
    ""Firms that report lacklustre results get punished,"" says Stephane Ekolo, strategist at
Tradition Securities in London. ""Investors are looking for guidance to gauge whether this bull
market will continue, and so far EU results do not provide a good omen. If you add the Italian
saga, no wonder market participants are dropping shares.""
    Meanwhile some analysts are much less punitive.
    Here's what Zürcher Kantonalbank told clients about the move in AMS shares.
    ""Today's share price reaction (-28%) is clearly exaggerated and cannot be attributed to
either the expected reduction in estimates already now noticeably below the guidance or to
deterioration of the liquidity or debt situation,"" they say.
    ""A portion of the share price setback may be attributable to the market and partly to the
apparent loss of some confidence in the currently ambitiously looking financial targets. The
stock remains very undervalued and we foresee clear recovery potential,"" they conclude.
    The plunge has pushed AMS shares back to levels last seen in February 2017.

    THE BULL MARKET IS DYING, BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET... (1040 GMT)
    Kepler Cheuvreux strategist Christopher Potts says October is the cruellest month, and the
sell-off we're seeing is proving him quite right. Still he believes that there's going to be one
more rally through November and December before U.S. monetary policy normalisation makes a
decisive move to knock down this long bull market. 
    ""The year-end rally in equity will contain the seeds of its own destruction because it
should be accompanied by a further upward move in yields of quality developed debt,"" says Potts.
""The signal should be given when we see yields at the short end of the Treasury curve trading
above the 3 percent threshold. One further increase in the funds rate by the Fed is required,
which we assume will be delivered on the eve of Christmas,"" he warns.
    So, in practical terms, how far can stock markets rally before the D-day of December's FOMC
meeting? Potts thinks major developed markets have a 5-8 percent upside potential, with the S&P
500 <.SPX> eventually returning to the 2,900 threshold and the EuroSTOXX50 <.STOXX50E> climbing
to 3,340-3,380 zone.

    MIGHTY DAX AND SLICK TECH CLOSE TO BEAR TERRITORY! (0933 GMT)
    Not to rub salt into the wound of an already painful session but it's just impossible to
ignore these two spooky red flags: the DAX <.GDAXI> and the European tech sector <.SX8P> are
getting very close to bear territory. 
    The German index is down about 17.5 percent from its January high and tech has lost 18.5
percent since its June peak.

    EUROPE PAINTED RED: ""THE SELL-OFF HAS RESUMED"" (0908 GMT)
    All major country indexes, all sectors but one (the defensive utilities) and 90 percent of
European stocks are falling this morning with the pan-regional STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark
firmly anchored at its lowest level since December 2016.
    ""The sell-off has resumed,"" says Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades in London. 
   
    ""The European sell-off is accentuated by the worrisome Italian crisis as the EU has now
raised its monitoring of Italian banks' liquidity, and this uncertainty is not pushing stock
traders go long on EU stocks.""
    Clearly worries over the Italian outlook and the mix of other global risk is pushing
investors away from stocks and towards safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese Yen,
although there are signs that cheap valuations are starting to lure some investors back.
    ""Personally I think that European equities look attractive at these levels, especially if
there's going to be an economic rebound in China over the coming months. The Italian situation
however needs to stabilise somewhat and it's not clear how it will, until the clash (between the
Italian government) and the EU lasts,"" says Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.

    EARNINGS TO THE RESCUE (0645 GMT) 
    Will today's harvest of Q3 earnings be sweet enough to offset the toxic bitterness of 
Brexit talks, Italian budget angst, Saudi isolation, trade wars, Chinese growth slowing down and
the fear of U.S. interest rates rising faster than expected? 
    It does not look like it and with European futures trading deep in the red, Paris' CAC 40,
Germany’s DAX and the STOXX benchmarks are likely to touch lows not seen since as long as two
years. 
    In the bearish automotive sector, bad news from Saab, which announced a rights issue and is
expected to post heavy losses at the open. Renault announced revenues fell 6 percent. In another
bearish sector, banking, Swedbank net profit beat forecast.
    It’s not looking good for money manager GAM, which is seeing an asset exodus. Other bell
weathers for the region include Dutch staffing Randstad.       
    Good earnings in tech lifted the Nasdaq on Monday and it is yet to be seen if the sector can
lift Europe too. Computer accessory firm Logitech confirmed its 2019 outlook after rising sales
while France's Atos and Ingenico lowered their outlooks. 
    Innate Pharma may also get a boost after Britain AstraZeneca bought a stake in the French
drugmaker.

    LOWS NOT SEEN IN A LONG TIME IN SIGHT AT THE OPEN (0557 GMT) 
    Depending on how bad the open is, there are plenty of indexes which are likely to touch
levels not seen for as long as two years.  
    The STOXX 600 is close to its December 2016 lows, the STOXXE is near February 2017 levels
and Paris' CAC 40 is in touching distance of March 2018 and August 2017. 
    Germany's DAX is close to February 2017 and even December 2016 lows:

    MORNING CALL: NOT MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO (0522 GMT) 
    Financial spreadbetters expect European stock markets to open in negative territory and why
wouldn't they? Asian markets are closing deep into negative territory after the S&P and the Dow
also ended lower.
    It's fair to say that the earnings season hasn't fully reassured investors who are facing a
toxic cocktail of negative drivers, from Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to concerns over
Italy's budget and Brexit talks.
    At the moment we have London's FTSE at 40 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 108 points and
Paris' CAC to lose 31 points lower at 5,022.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London/Moscow-October 23: Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on 
Tinkoff Bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'BB-' to Positive from 
Stable and affirmed all ratings. A full list of rating actions is at the end of 
this Rating Action Commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS AND VIABILITY RATING

The revision of the Outlook on Tinkoff's ratings to Positive from Stable 
reflects Fitch's expectation that continued business model diversification 
should result in even stronger profitability and less volatility through the 
credit cycle. The likely core capitalisation improvement, as the bank will need 
to hold more capital due to higher risk weights applied in regulatory accounts, 
also supports the Positive Outlook. 

Tinkoff's 'BB-' Long-Term IDRs are driven by its standalone creditworthiness, 
which is reflected in its Viability Rating (VR) of 'bb-'. The affirmation of the 
ratings reflects strong financial metrics, including a robust performance driven 
by current low funding and credit costs (for a consumer finance bank) and 
comfortable liquidity position, following the overall improvement of the 
operating environment. At the same time, the ratings continue to capture the 
segment's volatile nature with risks of overheating if overall retail loan 
growth in Russia continues to outpace that of personal incomes, increasing 
households' already high leverage.

Retail loan growth moderated to 14% in 1H18 (not annualised) and the bank 
expects its portfolio to increase by about 25% in 2018. This is manageable given 
the bank's strong internal capital generation capacity (Return on average equity 
(ROAE) of over 60% in 1H18 at the same time as a 50% dividend payout).

Asset quality remains vulnerable, despite improvements after the 2014-2015 
crisis, as Tinkoff is exposed to the volatile unsecured consumer lending (retail 
loans net of allowance made up 53% of total assets). Impaired retail loans 
(defined as Stage 3 loans starting from 2018) made up 14% of the retail book at 
end-1H18, but were reasonably covered at 80% by specific loan loss allowances. 
Average non-performing loans (NPLs) generation (calculated as increase in NPLs, 
plus write-offs, divided by average performing loans) increased moderately to 
11.9% in 1H18 from 8.8% in 2017. However, this increase was of technical nature, 
as NPLs have been slightly inflated in 1H18 due to IFRS 9 implementation, which 
requires interest to be accrued on net carrying amount of impaired loans (as 
opposed to the bank's previous policy of non-accruing it).

Asset quality should also be considered in light of robust profitability (Return 
on average assets of 8.7% and ROAE of 64% in 1H18, according to Fitch), offering 
significant resilience to potential stress. Fitch estimates that NPL generation 
would need to increase to 28% for the bank to have break-even profits. This 
scenario is deemed unlikely in the medium term. The bank's profitability has 
been recently underpinned by a growing share of low volatile non-credit-related 
income (20% of 1H18 operating revenues), such as fees from individual debit 
cards services, SME services, merchant acquiring and brokerage, 
non-credit-related insurance premiums earned, etc. We expect this to grow 
further, which could warrant the upgrade of the bank's ratings.

The Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio was moderate at 10% of end-1H18 risk-weighted 
assets (RWAs), according to consolidated financial accounts of TCS Group 
Holding. The 5% decline from 15% at end-2017 was mostly due to the one-off 
impact from IFRS 9 implementation, as the bank had to create over RUB10 billion 
(27% of end-2017 FCC) of additional loan loss allowances, including for Stage 1 
and Stage 2 exposures, which we consider conservative. We expect the FCC ratio 
to improve to about 13% over the next two years, as the bank will be required to 
hold more capital due to higher risk weights applied in its regulatory accounts.

Regulatory capital ratios are currently comfortable with core Tier 1 and Tier 1 
capital ratios of 11% and 15%, respectively, at end-8M18, according to the 
bank's standalone regulatory accounts. However, the bank's standalone capital 
ratios should be viewed in light of the intergroup loan of RUB8.4 billion (net 
of reserves) extended by the bank to its Cyprus-based holding company (TCS Group 
Holding) to finance the latter's own operations, including dividend payments. 
Fitch estimated the adjusted core Tier 1 capital ratio, net of this debt (which 
will be partially repaid from future dividends by the bank), to be a still 
reasonable 10%.

The bank's regulatory RWAs will increase by 20%-25% within the next two years 
(assuming zero growth), as a result of the increase of risk weights on unsecured 
loans extended after 1 September 2018. However, this should be manageable given 
the robust earnings generation.

In assessing Tinkoff's capital position, Fitch views positively the Tier 1 
eligible perpetual Eurobond of USD300 million (equivalent to RUB20 billion t), 
which bolsters the bank's total loss absorbing capital by a further 6.8% of 
consolidated RWAs. This has a relatively high write-down trigger of 5.125% 
(regulatory core Tier 1 capital ratio), which should support viability in a 
stress scenario.

Funding and liquidity positions are comfortable, underpinned by low reliance on 
wholesale debt, comfortable liquidity cushion and strong deposit collection 
capacity. Tinkoff is funded mainly by retail deposits (73% of end-1H18 
liabilities), which, albeit price-sensitive, have proven to be relatively 
stable, as the majority of these are insured. Liquidity risks are additionally 
mitigated by strong liquidity buffer, covering over 50% of the bank's customer 
accounts.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

The '5' Support Rating and 'No Floor' Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view 
that support from either the bank's shareholders or the Russian authorities, 
although possible, could not be relied upon, in all circumstances, due to the 
bank's small size and lack of overall systemic importance.

SENIOR UNSECURED AND SUBORDINATED DEBT RATINGS

Fitch has affirmed Tinkoff's senior unsecured debt rating at 'BB-', in line with 
its Long-Term Local-Currency IDR, reflecting Fitch's view of average recovery 
prospects, in case of default.

Fitch has also affirmed the rating of Tinkoff's perpetual additional Tier 1 
notes at 'B-', three notches below the bank's VR. The notching reflects higher 
loss severity relative to senior unsecured creditors, and non-performance risk 
due to the option to cancel coupon payments at the bank's discretion. The latter 
is more likely if the capital ratios fall in the capital buffer zone, although 
this risk is reasonably mitigated by Tinkoff's stable financial profile and 
general policy of maintaining decent headroom over minimum capital ratios.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Tinkoff's Long-Term IDRs and its VR could be upgraded in the next 12-18 months, 
provided that the bank further improves non-credit-related profitability through 
diversification, while beefing up capital buffers and maintaining adequate asset 
quality.

Tinkoff's ratings may come under pressure if credit losses increase 
significantly eroding profitability or capital, but Fitch views this as unlikely 
in the near term. 

Tinkoff's senior unsecured debt rating will move in tandem with the bank's 
Long-Term Local-Currency IDR. The bank's hybrid capital rating will not be 
upgraded after a one-notch upgrade of the bank's VR.

 

The rating actions are as follows: 

Tinkoff Bank

Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs: affirmed at 'BB-'; Outlooks revised 
to Positive from Stable

Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: affirmed at 'B'

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Madrid-October 23: Fitch Ratings has upgraded one tranche of 
Spanish RMBS AyT Goya Hipotecario III, FTA (Goya III), and placed one tranche of 
Spanish SME CLO Foncaixa FTGENCAT 4, FTA (FTGENCAT 4) on Rating Watch Positive 
(RWP). 

The rating action follows the upgrade of CaixaBank S.A. Long-Term Issuer Default 
Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'BBB' (see ""Fitch Upgrades CaixaBank to 'BBB+' on 
Reduced Capital Encumbrance "" dated 8 October 2018). A full list of rating 
actions follows at the end of this ratings action commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Linked to Caixabank Rating

The upgrade of Goya III class B notes' rating to 'BBB+sf' reflects the upgrade 
of Caixabank, which performs the role of SPV account bank provider. The class B 
notes' rating is capped at Caixabank's rating, as its only source of structural 
credit enhancement (CE) is the reserve fund that is placed in this entity. 

RWP Subject to Full Review

The RWP on FTGENCAT 4 class C notes' 'BBBsf' rating reflects the one-notch 
upgrade potential to 'BBB+sf', as Caixabank is the swap counterparty providing 
credit protection to the issuer. It pays interest on defaulted loans, providing 
significant support to the transaction during stressed scenarios. Fitch expects 
to resolve the RWP within the next six months after conducting a full asset and 
cash flow analysis.

Stable Performance Outlook

The transactions' performance remain stable over the past 12 months with 
three-month plus arrears (excluding defaults) as a percentage of current pool 
balance at around 0.2% and 5% for Goya III and FTGENCAT 4 as of the latest 
reporting date, respectively.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

A change in the account bank rating could trigger a corresponding change to the 
class B notes' rating of Goya III. 

The class C of FTGENCAT 4 could be upgraded to 'BBB+sf' if it is able to 
withstand the higher stresses embedded in the higher rating.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch has not conducted any checks on the consistency and plausibility of the 
information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the 
transactions.

Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third-party assessment of the asset 
portfolio information or conducted a review of origination files as part of its 
ongoing monitoring.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's 
rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that 
it is adequately reliable.

Fitch has taken the following rating actions: 

AyT Goya Hipotecario III, FTA 

Class B (ES0312274014) notes: upgraded to 'BBB+sf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable 

Foncaixa FTGENCAT 4, FTA 

Class C (ES0338013032) notes: 'BBBsf'; placed on RWP

    BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - A row between the eurosceptic
Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget has escalated with the EU Commission's decision on Oct.
23 to reject Italian budgetary plans for next year.
    The unprecedented move has formally opened a legal dispute
that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy until it is
resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but had not previously been applied to any
member of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to cutting its structural deficit by
0.6 points in 2019. But the government's new plans foresee
instead a rise in the structural deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP.
The structural balance excludes one-off expenditures, for
emergencies or natural catastrophes.
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of more than 130 percent of GDP, which should instead
fall, under EU rules.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the procedure and
of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
monthly meeting which is likely to put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 8: The Commission publishes its economic forecasts,
which would show whether EU calculations match Italy's growth,
debt and deficit projections underpinning its budget targets.
The data could pave the way to sanction procedures if EU and
Italian data differ widely.
    
    Nov. 13: Italy has three weeks from the date of the EU
decision to submit a revised budget. That sets a Nov. 13
deadline.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 4: The Commission would have three weeks from the
submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt a new opinion in
which it would describe Italy's overall budgetary position and
its impact on the whole euro zone. This deadline would expire on
Dec. 4 if Italy revised its budget on the last available day
allowed by the procedure. 
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission publishes its
new economic forecasts.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines.
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just a
few weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

    FIVE IN A ROW: EUROPE SUFFERS LONGEST LOSING STREAK SINCE JANUARY SELL-OFF (1638 GMT)
    European shares suffered a fifth straight day of losses today, sending the pan-regional
STOXX 600 benchmark closer to its lowest level in 2 years, as disappointing earnings, worries
over Italy and other geopolitical risks piled pressure on markets.
    Five days of losses are the longest losing streak since January when a spike in volatility
caused a big global equity sell-off which saw European shares falling for seven days in a row.  
 
 
    Another bleak milestone: the STOXX 600 is on track for its worst month since August 2015,
when fears of a hard landing for China's economy rattled global market, culminating a market
crash on August 24.

    AMS -28%: UNFORGIVING MARKETS, ANALYSTS LESS SO (1500 GMT)
    Apple <AAPL.O> chip suppler AMS <AMS.S> is seeing over one fourth of its market cap being
wiped off in just one trading day after an update that was clearly disappointing. [nL8N1X25PX]
    Still the magnitude of the drop - on track for its worst day since January 2008 - looks more
like an illustration of how markets, plagued by a broad range of risks, have become merciless,
rather than a straight reaction to poor numbers.
    ""Firms that report lacklustre results get punished,"" says Stephane Ekolo, strategist at
Tradition Securities in London. ""Investors are looking for guidance to gauge whether this bull
market will continue, and so far EU results do not provide a good omen. If you add the Italian
saga, no wonder market participants are dropping shares.""
    Meanwhile some analysts are much less punitive.
    Here's what Zürcher Kantonalbank told clients about the move in AMS shares.
    ""Today's share price reaction (-28%) is clearly exaggerated and cannot be attributed to
either the expected reduction in estimates already now noticeably below the guidance or to
deterioration of the liquidity or debt situation,"" they say.
    ""A portion of the share price setback may be attributable to the market and partly to the
apparent loss of some confidence in the currently ambitiously looking financial targets. The
stock remains very undervalued and we foresee clear recovery potential,"" they conclude.
    The plunge has pushed AMS shares back to levels last seen in February 2017.

    THE BULL MARKET IS DYING, BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET... (1040 GMT)
    Kepler Cheuvreux strategist Christopher Potts says October is the cruellest month, and the
sell-off we're seeing is proving him quite right. Still he believes that there's going to be one
more rally through November and December before U.S. monetary policy normalisation makes a
decisive move to knock down this long bull market. 
    ""The year-end rally in equity will contain the seeds of its own destruction because it
should be accompanied by a further upward move in yields of quality developed debt,"" says Potts.
""The signal should be given when we see yields at the short end of the Treasury curve trading
above the 3 percent threshold. One further increase in the funds rate by the Fed is required,
which we assume will be delivered on the eve of Christmas,"" he warns.
    So, in practical terms, how far can stock markets rally before the D-day of December's FOMC
meeting? Potts thinks major developed markets have a 5-8 percent upside potential, with the S&P
500 <.SPX> eventually returning to the 2,900 threshold and the EuroSTOXX50 <.STOXX50E> climbing
to 3,340-3,380 zone.

    MIGHTY DAX AND SLICK TECH CLOSE TO BEAR TERRITORY! (0933 GMT)
    Not to rub salt into the wound of an already painful session but it's just impossible to
ignore these two spooky red flags: the DAX <.GDAXI> and the European tech sector <.SX8P> are
getting very close to bear territory. 
    The German index is down about 17.5 percent from its January high and tech has lost 18.5
percent since its June peak.

    EUROPE PAINTED RED: ""THE SELL-OFF HAS RESUMED"" (0908 GMT)
    All major country indexes, all sectors but one (the defensive utilities) and 90 percent of
European stocks are falling this morning with the pan-regional STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark
firmly anchored at its lowest level since December 2016.
    ""The sell-off has resumed,"" says Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades in London. 
   
    ""The European sell-off is accentuated by the worrisome Italian crisis as the EU has now
raised its monitoring of Italian banks' liquidity, and this uncertainty is not pushing stock
traders go long on EU stocks.""
    Clearly worries over the Italian outlook and the mix of other global risk is pushing
investors away from stocks and towards safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese Yen,
although there are signs that cheap valuations are starting to lure some investors back.
    ""Personally I think that European equities look attractive at these levels, especially if
there's going to be an economic rebound in China over the coming months. The Italian situation
however needs to stabilise somewhat and it's not clear how it will, until the clash (between the
Italian government) and the EU lasts,"" says Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.

    EARNINGS TO THE RESCUE (0645 GMT) 
    Will today's harvest of Q3 earnings be sweet enough to offset the toxic bitterness of 
Brexit talks, Italian budget angst, Saudi isolation, trade wars, Chinese growth slowing down and
the fear of U.S. interest rates rising faster than expected? 
    It does not look like it and with European futures trading deep in the red, Paris' CAC 40,
Germany’s DAX and the STOXX benchmarks are likely to touch lows not seen since as long as two
years. 
    In the bearish automotive sector, bad news from Saab, which announced a rights issue and is
expected to post heavy losses at the open. Renault announced revenues fell 6 percent. In another
bearish sector, banking, Swedbank net profit beat forecast.
    It’s not looking good for money manager GAM, which is seeing an asset exodus. Other bell
weathers for the region include Dutch staffing Randstad.       
    Good earnings in tech lifted the Nasdaq on Monday and it is yet to be seen if the sector can
lift Europe too. Computer accessory firm Logitech confirmed its 2019 outlook after rising sales
while France's Atos and Ingenico lowered their outlooks. 
    Innate Pharma may also get a boost after Britain AstraZeneca bought a stake in the French
drugmaker.

    LOWS NOT SEEN IN A LONG TIME IN SIGHT AT THE OPEN (0557 GMT) 
    Depending on how bad the open is, there are plenty of indexes which are likely to touch
levels not seen for as long as two years.  
    The STOXX 600 is close to its December 2016 lows, the STOXXE is near February 2017 levels
and Paris' CAC 40 is in touching distance of March 2018 and August 2017. 
    Germany's DAX is close to February 2017 and even December 2016 lows:

    MORNING CALL: NOT MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO (0522 GMT) 
    Financial spreadbetters expect European stock markets to open in negative territory and why
wouldn't they? Asian markets are closing deep into negative territory after the S&P and the Dow
also ended lower.
    It's fair to say that the earnings season hasn't fully reassured investors who are facing a
toxic cocktail of negative drivers, from Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation to concerns over
Italy's budget and Brexit talks.
    At the moment we have London's FTSE at 40 points lower, Frankfurt's DAX down 108 points and
Paris' CAC to lose 31 points lower at 5,022.

    * First models set for launch in 2021
    * Dyson says UK needs ties with Asia after Brexit

 (Adds Singapore PM comments)
    By Paul Sandle
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire
British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, has chosen to
build his electric car in Singapore to be close to Asian
customers, supply chains and a highly skilled workforce.
    The 71-year-old entrepreneur, who backed Brexit in the 2016
referendum, already manufactures products such as hair dryers,
air purification systems and bladeless fans in Asia, while the
company's research and development remains in Britain.
    Dyson said last year that a 400-strong, British-based
engineering team had been secretly working for more than two
years on a $2.6 billion project to build an electric car.
    The company, one of Britain's biggest manufacturing success
stories, has not shown any designs for its electric vehicle,
although James Dyson has said it will not be like anything else
on the market and will not be a ""very cheap"".
    Dyson, who is not working with established car companies on
the project, had said the vehicle would be made close to
suppliers and its potential biggest markets, namely in Asia.
    ""The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on
supply chains, access to markets, and the availability of the
expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions,"" Dyson Chief
Executive Jim Rowan said after Singapore was chosen on Tuesday.
    Dyson already employs 1,100 people making 21 million digital
electric motors every year in Singapore.
    It said it would build a new two-storey manufacturing
facility in the city state, scheduled for completion in 2020,
with the first cars rolling off production lines a year later.
    Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: ""Singapore
used to assemble cars until the 1980s. Now we will manufacture
cars again, except this time greener, better, and more high
tech!"" 
    
    ELECTRIC MOTORS
    Carmakers are stepping up investment in electric vehicles in
response to ever-tightening emissions restrictions and penalties
on the use of internal combustion engines, with some countries
already promising outright bans. 
    Dyson is looking to exploit its ability in solid-state
battery technology and electric motors that are found in its
innovative vacuum cleaners and other products.
    James Dyson told reporters last year that his ambition to
take on the car makers was triggered when the industry dismissed
his idea to use the cyclonic technology that revolutionised
vacuum cleaners to clean diesel exhaust emissions in the 1990s.
    The inventor was a prominent backer of Britain's vote to
leave the European Union and has argued that Britain's future
lies in building close ties with fast-growing markets in Asia,
and not Europe.
    Singapore is a densely populated city-state and one of the
world's most expensive places to own a car. 
    It controls vehicle population through a system of bidding
for the right to own and use a vehicle for a limited number of
years. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla <TSLA.O>, criticised
Singapore for not being supportive of electric vehicles earlier
this year.
    But the city state has trade agreements with China and Japan
and Dyson CEO Rowan said the comparatively high cost base would
be offset by its technology expertise and focus.  
    ""It is therefore the right place to make high-quality
technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our
electric vehicle,"" he said.    
    Dyson started its work on the electric car in Wiltshire,
western England, where it is investing 200 million pounds ($260
million) in new buildings and a testing track at its campus.
    The privately-owned company reported a 40 percent rise in
turnover to 3.5 billion pounds last year and a 27 percent rise
in earnings to 801 million pounds, with 73 percent of the growth
coming from Asia.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona-October 23: This replaces the commentary published on 22 
October 2018 to correct that IVF is consolidated into the regional government's 
accounts and the number of board members recommended by IVF.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Instituto Valenciano de Finanza's (IVF) Long-Term 
Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'BBB-' and Short-Term 
Foreign Currency IDR at 'F3'. The Outlooks are Stable.  

 

Using a top-down basis under its ""Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating 
Criteria"" Fitch equalises IVF's ratings with those of Autonomous Community of 
Valencia. The affirmation reflects the unchanged statutory guarantee for IVF's 
financial obligations from Valencia, whose ratings were affirmed at 'BBB-'/'F3' 
with Stable Outlook on 19 October 2018. 

IVF is the lending arm of Valencia.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Under the criteria we assess the strength of linkage in status, ownership and 
control, as well as support track record and expectations; and the incentive to 
support, which covers the socio-political and financial implications of a GRE's 
default. In August 2018 the regional government introduced decree 118 to change 
the mission and the function of IVF. 

Status, Ownership and Control: assessed as very Strong 

IVF benefits from a statutory guarantee on its liabilities from the regional 
government. IVF is wholly owned by Valencia and is the only public sector entity 
(PSE) in Valencia that benefits from such an explicit guarantee from the 
regional government.  

The control and oversight by Valencia on IVF is highly supportive of the 
latter's credit quality, although IVF has gained independence with the 
introduction of decree 118. Three out of IVF's eight Board of Directors 
represent the regional government of Valencia, while the five others, with 
extensive and recognised experience are recommended by IVF. Valencia's annual 
budget law sets limits on IVF's debt (EUR800 million in 2018) and amount of debt 
that is guaranteed by the regional government (EUR500 million in 2018). 

Support Track Record and Expectations: assessed as very Strong

The regional government of Valencia has made recurrent capital injections into 
IVF to absorb credit losses. Valencia in August 2018 changed the mission of IVF 
so that it would no longer manage the debt of the public sector, as well as its 
organisation chart to increase its independence. IVF's lending policy may become 
more restrictive, resulting in more limited capital injections.  

Socio-Political Implications of Default: assessed as Moderate 

The change of mission also means that IVF will increasingly compete with 
regional domestic banks. Nevertheless, for long-term funding and also for 
several sectors the IVF still plays a dominant role on a regional scale. 

Financial Implication of Default: assessed as Moderate 

IVF's integration into the regional government sector is highly supportive of 
the entity's credit quality, as IVF is consolidated in Valencia's budgetary 
accounts.  Despite the recent change of mission, and based on IVF's record of 
managing the debt of the regional government as well as of its public sector, we 
believe a default of IVF could complicate the regional government's funding. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

A rating action on Valencia would be mirrored in IVF's ratings. 

Furthermore, a weakening in our assessment of the guarantee from the regional 
government on IVF's liabilities would lead to a downgrade.

 (Recasts with new quotes, details, context)
    By Andrew Osborn and Vladimir Soldatkin
    MOSCOW, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Washington will press ahead with
a plan to quit a landmark nuclear arms control pact despite
objections from Russia and some European countries, senior U.S.
official John Bolton said on Tuesday, after meeting Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
    Bolton had a 90-minute meeting in the Kremlin with Putin
which resulted in an agreement for the Russian leader to hold
talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Paris next month,
their first meeting since a July summit in Helsinki.
[nL8N1X377V]
    But the Moscow talks appeared to yield no breakthrough over
Trump's stated desire for Washington to leave the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF), a step Moscow has
decried as dangerous and many European countries have warned
could reignite a Cold War-style arms race.  
    ""There's a new strategic reality out there,"" Bolton, who is
National Security Advisor to Trump, told a news conference,
adding that the Cold War-era treaty did not address new missile
threats from countries such as China, Iran and North Korea, and
was therefore redundant.  
    ""In terms of filing the formal notice of withdrawal, that
has not been filed but it will be filed in due course,"" he said,
suggesting it was a process that could take several months. 
    Moscow has warned Washington it will be forced to respond in
kind to restore the military balance if Trump carries through
with his threat to quit the INF treaty, a 1987 agreement that
eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear
and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe.  
    Putin used the start of the meeting with Bolton to take the
White House to task over what he said were a series of
unprovoked U.S. steps against Moscow. But Bolton told reporters
afterwards Russian missiles were a threat and signalled
Washington would ignore Russian objections to its exit plans.
    ""The problem is there are Russian INF violations in Europe
now,"" Bolton told reporters, repeating an allegation Moscow
denies.
    ""The threat is not America's INF withdrawal from the treaty.
The threat is Russian missiles already deployed.""
    He said Russia had first illegally tested a land-based
cruise missile in 2008 and described its violations of the
treaty as ""long and deep"". Russia in turn accuses Washington of
violating the same treaty, something it denies.
    Bolton has said the treaty is outdated because other
countries remain free to make intermediate-range ballistic
missiles and cruise missiles while the United States finds its
hands tied. He noted that previous efforts to expand the treaty
to include other countries had come to nothing. 
    
    COAT OF ARMS
    Putin made an acerbic reference to the U.S. coat of arms at
the start of his meeting with Bolton.
    ""We barely respond to any of your steps but they keep on
coming,"" he jokily complained to Bolton. 
    ""On the coat of the arms of the United States there's an
eagle holding 13 arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the
other. My question is whether your eagle has gobbled up all the
olives leaving only the arrows?""
    Bolton quipped that he had not brought any olives.
    Before the talks, a Kremlin spokesman said the INF treaty
had its weak points, but that the U.S. approach of talking about
leaving it without proposing a replacement was dangerous.
    But Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, speaking to
reporters after the talks finished, sounded a conciliatory note,
saying that Moscow viewed Bolton's visit as a sign that
Washington wanted to continue dialogue on the issue. He said
Moscow wanted the same thing.
    Ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, now 87 and an original
signatory to the treaty, has warned that unravelling the pact
could have catastrophic consequences. Countries such as Poland
have, however, backed Trump's move.
    Trump's withdrawal announcement is causing particular
concern in Europe which was the main beneficiary of the INF
treaty as a result of the removal of Pershing and U.S. cruise
missiles from Europe and of Soviet SS-20 missiles from the
European part of the then Soviet Union. 
    Without the treaty, some European countries fear that
Washington might deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
Europe again and that Russia might move to deploy such missiles
in its exclave of Kaliningrad which would once again turn Europe
into a potential nuclear battlefield.         
    Bolton said Washington was ""a long way"" from making any such
deployments in Europe and said grim warnings about the dangerous
consequences of Washington quitting the treaty were wide of the
mark and reminded him of similarly hollow warnings when the
United States left the Cold War-era Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty in 2002. 
    ""It was not true then and it will not be true now,"" he said.

    WILL EARNINGS HELP LIFT MORALE? (0655 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to rise at the open although it is not clear at this stage
whether it will only be a limited and technical rebound. That will depend pretty much how
today’s new batch of corporate results are digested by the market. 
    One probable piece of good news is Kering, which is set for big gains at the open after its
results. 
    It’s also a big day for banking shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe. 
    Deutsche Bank announced a steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track to
swing to a profit this year. 
    Nordea also had a weak quarter and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity. Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned
to cut at least 1,600 jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter operating
profit slightly above market expectations. 
    In the UK, Barclays reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as its under-pressure
investment banking division booked increased trading revenues despite difficult market
conditions.
    Still in financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose. 
    Heineken is also a big one with sales at the world’s second largest brewer rising in Q3. 
    In the tech sector, which got a beating yesterday and is also close to bear market
territory, STMicro Q3 profits rose on strong automotive, imaging sales. Other blue chips
reporting include France’s Safran and Edenred, Spain’s Iberdrola as well as Norway's Telenor and
Norsk Hydro. 
    Also, in what could be a blow to one of the most high-profile Franco-German tie-up, sources
told Reuters that Siemens and Alstom will receive a warning this week from European Union
antitrust regulators that their plan to create a rail champion will hurt competition.

    NO REBOUND IN SIGHT (0540 GMT)
    After five sessions in the red in a row and hitting two years low, there is still no rebound

    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 147 points lower and Paris' CAC to
lose 74 points. An expection perhaps for London with the FTSE expected to open 69 points higher.

777,5118,6e23462bd007e2124ddaba65f6deff3f,Croatia's public debt to fall further despite dock troubles -finmin,2018-10-24 15:30:45,EUR,0.0,2018-10-24 15:30:45,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    ZAGREB, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Croatia's public debt will fall
further this year despite looming payments for state guarantees
extended to an ailing Adriatic shipyard, Finance Minister
Zdravko Maric said on Wednesday.
    Croatia is making effort to push its public debt towards 60
percent of gross domestic product with a goal to be ready to
adopt the euro currency in the next 6-7 years.
    ""Despite payments on the basis of state guarantees extended
between 2010 and 2018, which we still have to see how exactly
they will be statistically treated, the public debt will
continue falling this year,"" Maric told a cabinet session.
    He didn't forecast an exact figure for this year. At the end
of last year Croatia's public debt amounted to 77.5 percent of
gross domestic product. Tentatively the government aims to cut
the public debt by 2-3 percentage points each year.
    Maric said that this year Croatia will pay at least 2.35
billion kuna ($362.95 million) for extended state guarantees to
Uljanik <ULJN.ZA> and then another 2.0 billion kuna next year,
while the overall sum of extended guarantees in the last eight
years is 7.5 billion kuna.
    Uljanik runs two docks in the northern Adriatic cities of
Pula and Rijeka. Its workers are currently on strike due to
unpaid salary for September and the company is on the verge of
bankruptcy. [nL8N1X21W5]
    Originally Croatia planned a general budget gap of 0.5
percent this year and Maric recently said the final figure would
have been much better and likely the budget in surplus had it
not been for Uljanik troubles. The government prepares a budget
reshuffle in November to incorporate the costs of guarantees.

 (Adds Staley quote, shares, more detail)
    By Lawrence White and Emma Rumney
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays <BARC.L> beat
third quarter profit forecasts on Wednesday and reported higher
revenues at its under-pressure investment bank, although its
costs rose.
    The results gave Barclays' shares an initial lift after it
reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.07
billion), excluding litigation and conduct costs, above the 1.33
billion pounds expected by analysts polled by the bank.
    ""In spite of macro-economic uncertainty, and particularly
concerns over Brexit which weigh heavily on market sentiment,
2018 is proving to be a year of delivery on our strategy at
Barclays,"" its chief executive Jes Staley said.
    The bank's shares were up 0.7 percent by 0747 GMT,
outperforming the STOXX European banks index <.SX7P> which was
down by 0.5 percent.
    The profit excluded costs from litigation and fines for
misconduct, which have blighted Barclays in recent years as it
paid out for misdeeds during and after the financial crisis.
    Barclays group profits for the first nine months of 2018
fell in comparison with the same period last year, as it booked
a 1.4 billion pound settlement with the U.S. Department of
Justice over mis-selling mortgage backed securities. 
    Since taking over as CEO, Staley has pushed an investment
banking-led strategy that has drawn criticism from some
shareholders and been the target of a campaign by activist
investor Edward Bramson. 
    While the transatlantic consumer and wholesale lender saw
income in its market trading business rise by 19 percent in the
third quarter, this came at a cost. 
    The cost-income ratio for Barclays International rose to 69
percent from 62 percent in the first quarter. Barclays is
targeting a ratio of below 60 percent at group level over time. 
    Meanwhile, the unit's return on tangible equity was 7
percent, compared with 19.9 percent in Barclays cards and
payments business and 22 percent for Barclays UK. 
    The bank also said it will redeem $2.65 bln worth of
preference shares, in a move it said would reduce its annual
funding costs by 165 million pounds a year.
    Barclays reported a better than expected core capital ratio
of 13.2 percent at the end of the third quarter. This had been
depleted by fines and misconduct costs in recent years and was a
further source of concern for investors.
    Barclays in August signalled confidence in capital levels by
announcing a better than expected interim dividend. [nL5N1UT1GM]
    The bank reiterated it was on track to pay a dividend of 6.5
pence per share for 2018.
    Barclays also said the Irish central bank had given it
permission to expand its Irish operations, as it transfers the
ownership of all of its European branches to the entity ahead of
Brexit on March 29.

companies accelerated to yet another post-crisis high in
September, the European Central Bank said on Wednesday.
    Lending growth to corporations expanded by 4.3 percent last
month after 4.1 percent in September, its highest since
mid-2009, while household lending growth held steady at a
post-crisis high of 3.1 percent. 
    Purchasing 2.6 trillion euros worth of debt over nearly four
years, the ECB has held down borrowing costs to stimulate
lending and rekindle growth and inflation.
    While its efforts have mostly paid off, economic growth has
softened this year and underlying inflation remains stubbornly
low. 
    Still, with unemployment dropping and the threat of
deflation warded off, the ECB remains on course to end its bond
purchases this year and raise rates for the first time since
2011 sometime next autumn, satisfied that inflation will
continue to rise even with reduced support.
    The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply,
which in part reflects the amount of cash pumped in by the ECB
itself, pick up to 3.5 percent from 3.4 percent a month earlier,
in line with expectations for 3.5 percent.
    The ECB will next meet on Thursday and while it is all but
certain to keep policy unchanged, it is expected to discuss a
marked deterioration in the growth outlook.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The pound fell to a three-week
low on Wednesday before British Prime Minister Theresa May meets
with Conservative Party lawmakers, some of whom have discussed
toppling her in anger at her Brexit negotiations.      
    May is seeking to win over lawmakers in her party who oppose
her approach to Brexit negotiations, stuck at an impasse just
over five months before the United Kingdom leaves the European
Union. 
    The prospect of a leadership challenge and of politics
scuppering an agreement with the EU has weakened the currency in
recent days.
    Sterling fell on Wednesday to $1.2934, its lowest since Oct.
4, and traded down 0.3 percent <GBP=D3>. Against the euro, the
pound was flat at 88.25 pence <EURGBP=D3>.  
     ""Sterling [traders] are parsing the words coming out of
Westminster and Brussels, for clues but the issue is that the
range of final outcomes is very broad,"" said Andrew Milligan,
head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
    ""We are still stuck in the $1.28 to 1.32 range. The answer
for investors is to stay close to benchmark or slightly short,""
he said.
    Sterling briefly gained half a percent against the dollar
and euro on Tuesday after a media report that the EU could offer
May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal.
[nL8N1X350A]
    A disagreement on a fallback plan for the border between
Northern Ireland and Ireland is a key sticking point. 
    The British newspaper The Times on Wednesday reported that a
long-running transition phase could be rolled over annually if
needed - effectively leaving the UK in an open-ended
Norway-style relationship with the EU.
    ""GBP may trade softer if there's a leadership challenge,
although it's unlikely that Theresa May loses the challenge,""
said Mayank Mishra, a global strategist at Standard Chartered.
    ""We believe GBP is pricing considerable risk premium due to
Brexit and political uncertainty at this point, suggesting room
for upside as these uncertainties fade,"" he added.

    SOFIA, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's government survived a
no-confidence vote on Wednesday brought by the opposition
Socialists who accused it of failing to overhaul the ailing
healthcare sector.
    The Socialists said the government, which has been in office
since May 2017, had not tackled high debt levels in state
hospitals, inefficient management and an exodus of doctors and
nurses seeking better pay.
    But coalition lawmakers defeated the third no-confidence
vote against the centre-right coalition government - 133 out of
the 240 members of parliament voted against it.
    After the vote, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, deputy leader of ruling
GERB party, said the government was ""striving to solve the
problems that have been piling up for years"".
    The health ministry has called for a public debate on
healthcare reforms and proposed bringing in obligatory monthly
health insurance payments - an option opposed by the Socialists.
    Political analysts expect pressure on the coalition
government to grow ahead of the elections for the European
Parliament in May.

    By Jonathan Cable
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth slowed
much faster than expected this month, dragged down by waning
orders that put a big dent in confidence, adding to evidence the
bloc's halcyon days are behind it for now, a survey showed.
    October's disappointing survey is likely to concern
policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are expected to
end their bond-buying programme in less than three months,
despite a slew of political and trade concerns. [ECILT/EU]
    The economic slowdown comes amid an escalating trade war
between the United States and China, a spiraling debt dispute in
Italy, deadlocked Brexit negotiations and the prospect of
steadily tightening financial conditions. 
    Both the euro <EUR=> and euro zone government bond yields
dropped on Wednesday after the survey's release, with the single
currency falling half a percent to $1.1417, its lowest since
Aug. 20. [nL8N1X429V]
    Markets have taken a battering recently and European stocks
<.STOXX> were trading near a two-year low on Tuesday, down 20
percent from their peak, but the index rose 0.6 percent on
Wednesday. [MKTS/GLOB]
    ""The euro area economy is clearly suffering from the
uncertainty created by the trade war and weaker global growth
momentum, and the weakness is spreading to the domestic
economy,"" said Jan von Gerich at Nordea. ""The weak PMI data
clearly increase downside risks to the euro area growth
outlook.""
    Indeed, the outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for
the first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who
are also concerned about the U.S.-China trade war and have
repeatedly said euro zone growth is well past its peak.
[ECILT/WRAP]
    ECB policymakers have slowly trimmed asset purchases, hoping
they have done enough to bolster growth and inflation and are
expected to hold policy steady on Thursday - despite evidence
euro zone growth momentum peaked some time ago.
    ""Amid the fiscal stand-off between Rome and Brussels as well
as increasingly jittery global markets, the ECB is likely to
stress caution,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
    IHS Markit said if the survey levels were maintained, they
pointed to fourth quarter growth of 0.3 percent. That would be
the slowest pace in 2 1/2 years and below the 0.4 percent
predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month.
    Earlier figures from Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
showed private-sector growth slowed to its weakest in more than
three years as manufacturing and services both lost momentum.
[nL9N1T2013]
    Germany's Chambers of Industry and Commerce, DIHK, last week
cut its 2018 growth forecast and predicted a slowdown next year
as the country faces mounting risks at home and abroad. It
predicted 2019 growth of 1.7 percent, below a Reuters poll
forecast of 1.8 percent. [nL8N1WY1Z8]
    However, it was a different story in France, the bloc's
second-biggest economy. Its growth accelerated as strength in
services offset weakness in manufacturing. [nL9N1T2012]

    ACROSS THE BOARD
    IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for
the euro zone tumbled to a 25-month low of 52.7 from a final
September reading of 54.1, significantly below the median
expectation in a Reuters poll for a modest dip to 53.9. The
lowest forecast was for 53.2.
    Anything above 50 in the survey, which is regarded as a good
guide to economic health, indicates growth.
    Suggesting companies don't expect a rebound anytime soon,
the future output index, which gauges optimism, fell to a near
four-year low of 59.4. A similar reading from manufacturers fell
to a level not seen in almost six years.
    Manufacturers suffered a similar fate with their PMI sinking
to 52.1 from 53.2, missing a median prediction for 53.0, as
factory orders contracted for the first time since late-2014.
    An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite
PMI, dropped to 51.2 from 52.7. It hasn't been lower since the
end of 2014.
    A similar gloomier picture emerged for the bloc's dominant
service industry. The services PMI plummeted to a two-year low
of 53.3 from September's 54.7, also far short of all forecasts
in a Reuters poll.
    In a further sign of a dimming outlook, the services
employment index - a lagging indicator, also fell.

deposits rose in September for an eighth consecutive month,
increasing by 139 million euros  ($159.34 million), central bank
data showed on Wednesday.
    Businesses and household deposits rose to 131.71 billion
euros from 131.57 billion in August, the Bank of data showed.
    Greek banks have seen deposit inflows over the space of more
than two years after the country clinched a third bailout to
stay in the euro zone in July 2015.
    Athens exited its latest bailout in August and will rely on
bond markets to refinance its debt.
    While the country's banks still turn to central bank
borrowing to plug their funding gaps, they have significantly
reduced their exposure.
    ""In September, deposits placed by the private sector
increased by 102 million, compared with an increase of 1.297
billion in the previous month and the annual growth rate stood
at 7.4 percent from 7.3 percent in the previous month,"" the Bank
of Greece said.

percent versus the euro on Wednesday after survey data indicating slowing growth
in the euro area, the central European region's main trading partner.
[nL9N1T2014]
    At 0927 GMT, the zloty traded 0.23 percent weaker at 4.3014 per euro, having
hit its weakest level since last Friday.
    ""The zloty lost some ground against the dollar, but that was a result of the
euro's weakening (against the dollar) after the PMI data,"" said Marcin Zawiślak,
FX senior dealer at Santander Bank Polska, referring to Purchasing Managers
Index figures.
    The trader said the extent of the fall was less significant versus the euro,
the region's reference currency.
    Euro zone business growth lost far more momentum than expected as it entered
the final quarter of 2018, dragged down by waning orders that dented confidence.
    Other regional currencies were little changed, with the forint hovering
around the 323 mark as trading resumed after a four-day weekend. Traders said
little activity was expected in the forint in the remaining sessions of the
shortened week.
    ""There will not be major moves,"" a Budapest-based currency dealer said,
predicting a range of 322.50 to 323.60 versus the euro in coming days.
    Budapest stocks, however, shielded from Tuesday's selloff, fell 1.6 percent,
underperforming the region and extending their losses for the year to 7 percent.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 24: EU banks may need to hold significantly more 
capital for operational risk under the final version of Basel III reforms than 
under current requirements, while US banks may see a reduction in requirements, 
Fitch Ratings says. This would bring operational risk-weighted assets (RWA) as a 
proportion of total RWAs more into line between EU and US banks. Currently, the 
average ratio for large EU banks is less than 15%, compared with about 30% for 
large US banks.

For large EU banks (those with Tier 1 capital of more than EUR3 billion), 
capital requirements for operational risk would, on average, be about 35% higher 
than currently, adding 4.7% to their overall Tier 1 minimum required capital, 
according to analysis this month from the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision. The step-up is mainly due to a requirement for some EU banks to 
reflect their history of operational risk losses as an add-on when calculating 
how much capital to hold for potential future losses. The impact is significant 
because several banks' recent history includes large fines for mis-selling and 
other regulatory breaches.

The new standardised approach for operational risk capital was introduced in the 
launch of the final version of the international Basel III framework, but the 
decision on whether to factor in historical losses is left to the discretion of 
regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction. While EU authorities have opted to 
include historical losses, the US authorities appear to have decided against 
this in the latest round of impact analysis. 

As the largest US banks currently determine capital for operational risk using 
internal models heavily influenced by past losses, a decision to ignore past 
losses could significantly reduce these requirements. According to the Basel 
Committee's analysis, capital requirements for operational risk under the new 
rules would be about 17% lower for large US banks, reducing their overall Tier 1 
minimum required capital by 4.2%. The impact could be less significant than 
this, depending on the effect of a capital floor that applies - the so-called 
Collins Amendment floor. 

The US stance is consistent with recent comments from the Federal Reserve 
questioning the use of past losses as a predictor of future losses, particularly 
when a bank's risk profile is changing. The resulting operational RWA metrics 
will therefore not be directly comparable between EU and US banks unless the 
approaches are aligned. The final version of Basel III is scheduled to be phased 
in over 2022-2027. 

Higher capital requirements tend to lead banks to hold more capital, making them 
stronger on an economic basis, which is credit positive. Capital for operational 
risk is just one element of a bank's overall capital position. The US currently 
has a more conservative capital approach than the EU in several respects, 
including higher Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements for the largest US banks. A 
step-up in operational RWAs for EU banks and a reduction for US banks would 
narrow the gap in capital requirements - both for operational risk and overall.

This month's Basel Committee analysis confirms that large banks worldwide have 
made strong progress towards building the capital they will need under Basel 
III. The combined capital shortfall for large banks amounted to common equity 
Tier 1 capital of just EUR5.2 billion at end-2017, compared with EUR27 billion 
at end-2015. The main drivers of this were profit retention, particularly by US 
and Chinese banks, and capital raising, particularly by EU banks. The shortfall 
in additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital also reduced significantly, to EUR20.6 
billion from EUR63.1 billion.

    TUNIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Tunisia will sell a Eurobond worth
500 million euros ($570 million), a government official told
Reuters on Wednesday.
    The North African country had previously said it planned to
sell bonds worth $1 billion.
    ""The amount of bonds was limited to 500 million euros"", an
official told Reuters without giving reason for the lower amount
    Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup and Natixis
have been appointed to handle the sale, a source told Reuters
last week.
    Last month, the International Monetary Fund approved the
payment of a $245 million loan tranche to Tunisia, the fifth
under its loan programme with the North African country, paving
the way for the bond issue.
    The loan programme is tied to Tunis pursuing economic
reforms aimed at keeping its deficit under control.

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Private equity’s
broadband rush is dicier than it looks. Buyout groups are
building broadband networks across Europe, attracted by stable,
healthy returns. Yet the numbers get trickier if bigger
operators compete.
    Britain’s CityFibre, backed by a Goldman Sachs <GS.N> fund
and private equity group Antin, is just the latest example of a
financial sponsor piling into broadband. On Tuesday it announced
a 2.5 billion pound push to connect up to 5 million homes to a
fibre network. Deutsche Glasfaser, owned by KKR <KKR.N>, is
doing something similar in smaller German towns, as is Macquarie
Group’s <MQG.AX> TDC Group in Denmark. 
    The returns look good if consumers’ demand for fast internet
access means they switch from the copper networks run by
incumbent operators like BT Group <BT.L>. Assume a new player
like CityFibre spends 550 pounds per home and builds half a
million connections a year. Next, assume 40 percent of
households take up the service, and CityFibre charges 14 pounds
per customer, and makes an EBITDA margin of 70 percent. 
    Fast forward six years, and the operator would have 3
million lines, 202 million pounds of revenue, and 141 million
pounds of EBITDA. The total cost of building the network would
be 1.65 billion euros, although perhaps 60 percent of that could
be funded by debt, reducing the equity cheque to 660 million
pounds. If the operator can sell the business at an
infrastructure-like multiple of 15 times EBITDA, the business
could be sold for 2.1 billion pounds, and the equity would have
nearly doubled to 1.1 billion pounds, equivalent to an internal
rate of return of around 16 percent. 
    It sounds easy, but there are a couple of snags. Competitors
may invest in the same regions, leading to a lower uptake and
more humdrum returns. That’s why some funds are focusing on
small towns, where they hope to build a monopoly. But incumbent
operators like BT may have an interest in preserving a national
position, resulting in excess capacity. 
    Consumers also need to play ball. The existing copper
networks may be good enough for many households’ needs to stream
movies and surf the web, making them reluctant to switch. Over
time, demand for data should skyrocket as everyday objects from
fridges to cars are connected to the internet. But private
equity may have a longer wait than expected.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - CityFibre, a British broadband operator backed by Goldman
Sachs, said on Oct. 23 it would spend 2.5 billion pounds ($3.25
billion) on rolling out fibre networks in 37 towns and cities.
It hopes to offer connections to as many as 5 million homes. 
    - The company, which was bought by Goldman Sachs West Street
Infrastructure Partners and private equity firm Antin for $750
million earlier this year, is taking on national provider BT
Group. 
    - CityFibre said its networks, which offer gigabit speeds,
would help deliver one third of the government's 2025 target of
connecting 15 million homes. The company has previously said the
cost of reaching each home will be between 350 pounds and 480
pounds.

Danish lawmaker and Danske Bank)
    By Teis Jensen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The whistleblower who helped
to reveal a major money laundering scandal at Denmark's largest
bank, Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>, will testify before the European
Parliament and the Danish Parliament at two events in November.
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015,
many of which the bank said in a report last month it thinks are
suspicious.
    The scandal has led the bank's former chief executive Thomas
Borgen to resign and almost halved Danske Bank share price since
February.
    Howard Wilkinson, a British trader in Danske Bank's Estonia
branch until 2014, will testify at public hearings in Copenhagen
on Nov. 19, and in Brussels on Nov. 21.
    Wilkinson has agreed to testify before the two parliaments
as ""all voters in Europe have a right to know what their
governments are doing to stop corruption and protect
whistleblowers,"" his U.S. attorney Stephen M. Kohn said in an
email to Reuters.
    Danske Bank, the financial regulator and the state
prosecutor for financial crime are also invited to the hearing
in Copenhagen, which is expected to be a major media event, one
of the organisers, left-wing lawmaker Rune Lund, told Reuters.
    It is crucial that Wilkinson will be free of any
non-disclosure agreements following his tenure at Danske Bank so
that he can speak freely, the spokesman for the European
Parliament committee that arranges the Brussels hearing, Jeppe
Kofod, told Reuters.
    Danske Bank declined to comment on the hearings on
Wednesday.

both travellers and cargo could result from a no-deal Brexit,
the global airline industry body IATA warned on Wednesday,
calling on UK and European Union aviation authorities to work
towards maintaining connectivity. 
    Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29 2019
but with just five months to go, Prime Minister Theresa May has
yet to reach a withdrawal deal and both sides have stepped up
preparations for the possibility there will not be one.
    The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on
Wednesday that planning for a no-deal Brexit needed to move much
faster to ensure that planes can keep flying and that safety and
regulatory frameworks continue to function whatever sort of
relationship the pair have after March 29.
    ""It is now essential that the EU and UK civil aviation
authorities plan for contingency arrangements to maintain a
minimum level of connectivity, which is vital for people and for
business,"" IATA's Director General Alexandre de Juniac said in a
statement. 
    ""A backstop contingency plan to keep planes flying after
March must be published, and quickly."" 
    The chief executive of Ryanair <RYA.I>, one of Europe's
biggest airlines, has warned that if there is a no-deal Brexit,
UK flights could be grounded for up to three weeks. 
    But IATA said it did not expect flights to be grounded in a
no-deal Brexit. 
    ""As a short term, emergency fall-back position, we
understand that the EU and UK CAA have plans for a ‘bare bones’
agreement ... to ensure at least a basic level of connectivity,""
IATA said in a study also published on Wednesday.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 24: Fitch Ratings has upgraded BPM 
Securitisation 2 S.r.l.'s class C notes and affirmed class A2 and B, as follows. 


Class A2 (ISIN IT0004083025) affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Negative

Class B (ISIN IT0004083033) affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Negative

Class C (ISIN IT0004083041) upgraded to 'BBB+sf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable

The securitisation comprises Italian residential mortgages originated by Banca 
Popolare di Milano (BPM) before it merged with Banco Popolare into a new entity 
Banco BPM, which is now servicer for the transaction. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Decreasing Arrears; Solid Credit Support

Three months-plus arrears have decreased to 1.2% in June 2018 from 1.8% in June 
2017 while cumulative gross defaults have remained broadly stable at 3%. Both 
risk measures stand below Fitch's Italian RMBS indices and show better 
performance than peer transactions that closed in the same year (2006). 
Consistent strong performance of the underlying pool over the life of the deal 
has built up solid credit enhancement (CE) for the rated notes. CE is more than 
35% for the class A2 and B notes, resulting in today's affirmation.

Cash Reserve Back to Target

Over the last three note payment dates, the transaction has generated sufficient 
excess spread to replenish the cash reserve up to its target amount, leading to 
6.1% CE for the class C notes. The reserve was first drawn last year due to a 
one-off uptick in defaults which, in Fitch's view, did not suggest any 
performance deterioration. As the cash reserve provides the only source of CE 
for the class C notes, the full replenishment of the reserve underpins the 
upgrade of this tranche. 

With the cash reserve back at target, amortisation of the class A2 and B notes 
on a pro-rata basis has resumed as the performance and structural conditions 
have been met again. 

Commingling Risk Immaterial 

Collections from the portfolio are transferred on the same day of collection 
from the account of the servicer to the account held by the issuer at the 
account bank. Therefore, in line with Fitch's counterparty risk rating criteria, 
commingling risk is viewed as an immaterial risk driver and no commingling loss 
has been sized in the analysis.

Sovereign Cap

Italian securitisations can achieve a maximum rating of 'AAsf', six notches 
above Italy's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR; BBB/Negative), which is the 
case for the class A2 and B notes. The Negative Outlook on these two tranches 
reflects that of the sovereign IDR.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Changes to Italy's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating and the rating cap for 
Italian structured finance transactions, currently 'AAsf', could trigger rating 
changes on the class A and B notes.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has 
received about the performance of the asset pool and the transaction. There were 
no findings that affected the rating analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the 
results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio information or 
conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. 

Fitch did not undertake a review of the information provided about the 
underlying asset pool ahead of the transaction's initial closing. The subsequent 
performance of the transaction over the years is consistent with the agency's 
expectations given the operating environment and Fitch is therefore satisfied 
that the asset pool information relied upon for its initial rating analysis was 
adequately reliable.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's 
rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that 
it is adequately reliable.

maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast 
information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and 
underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch 
conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it 
in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification 
of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are 
available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's 
factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of 
relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its 
advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as 
audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,

should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any

in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the 
report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. 
This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or 
sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals 
identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible 
for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes 
only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute 
for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer 
and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be 
changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the 
adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular 
investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to 
any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 
(or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or

likely to leave the European Union next year with no deal,
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday.
    The United Kingdom is due to exit the EU on March 29 but
Prime Minister Theresa May's talks with Brussels have stalled
over a fallback plan for the border between Northern Ireland and
EU member Ireland. [nL8N1X42JZ]
    That is stoking concern about a possible failure to reach a
Brexit deal, which most economists say would throw the world's
No. 5 economy into disarray. 
    Sturgeon said she believed May's government was ""closing
down the negotiating space"" to reach a Brexit deal with the EU.
    ""I am increasingly concerned, literally with every day that
passes right now, that the prospect of no deal is becoming ever
greater,"" she told a Scottish parliamentary committee.
    ""We're in a fluid situation ... I think no deal might
actually be the most likely outcome, and that is deeply
concerning,"" she said. ""It is staggering incompetence that the
government has allowed it to get to this stage.""
    Sturgeon, whose party supports Scottish independence, has
said she will wait to see the detail of any Brexit deal before
deciding on Scotland's own path. 
    But she has expressed frustration that Scotland will leave
the EU reflecting Britain's overall 52-48 percent vote to leave
without, she argues, Scotland having had a proper say in the
process. 
    Scotland, one of the United Kingdom's four nations, voted
62-38 percent to stay in the EU.
    ""I think Brexit is frankly shaping up to the biggest failure
of government policy and handling of a situation that any of us
have seen maybe in our entire lifetimes,"" she said.

opinions expressed are their own.)
    By Liam Proud and Antony Currie
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The dividends that
Daimler <DAIGn.DE> and Ford <F.N> lavish on their shareholders
have the whiff of roadkill. The two carmakers are the industry's
worst stock market performers so far this year and on track to
pay out a higher share of earnings than peers. They will have to
dip into company coffers to do so. That looks unsustainable.
    The duo’s peers will on average return roughly a quarter of
their earnings to investors this year, using Refinitiv Smart
Estimates. Daimler and Ford are set to pay out about 44 percent
and 55 percent respectively. That would be fine if they were
generating enough dough. But total free cash flow over the next
three years of about $8.5 billion for Daimler and $2.5 billion
for Ford, again on Refinitiv data, will cover just two-thirds
and one-third respectively of estimated payouts. They would
jointly need to dip into cash reserves to the tune of almost $10
billion to bridge the gap.
    That’s a poor use of capital. All the major carmakers have
been sputtering thanks to everything from trade wars to weak
sales. These problems have depressed Toyota's <7203.T> market
value by 9 percent so far this year, and both General Motors'
<GM.N> and Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> by around a fifth.
    Ford, though, has had the roughest ride. Its China sales
have fallen almost a third this year whereas industry-wide sales
in the country were up 1.5 percent. The company’s operation
there was leaderless for nine months until the appointment on
Tuesday of Chery Jaguar Land Rover chairman Anning Chen. Chief
Executive James Hackett has also yet to prove that his cost
cutting-centric turnaround plan for the Blue Oval is bearing
fruit, or that his electric- and autonomous-vehicle strategy is
heading in the right direction. As a result, Ford's stock has
gone down 31 percent in the year to date.
    Daimler has barely fared better, shedding 29 percent of its
value after two profit warnings in four months. True, one-offs
such as the effects of new emissions schemes are partly to
blame. Yet global demand for premium cars may have peaked, and
Daimler’s supply chain costs are likely to rise if the trade war
intensifies. The stock slump has pushed dividend yields up to
7.1 percent for Daimler and 8.4 percent for Ford, compared with
4.8 percent for other U.S. and European carmakers. That implies
shareholders think the payouts are too racy. The two struggling
companies just need to take their foot off the accelerator.

and private equity group Antin, is just the latest example of a
financial sponsor piling into broadband. On Tuesday it announced
a 2.5 billion pound push to connect up to 5 million homes to a
fibre network. Deutsche Glasfaser, owned by KKR <KKR.N>, is
doing something similar in smaller German towns, as is Macquarie
Group’s <MQG.AX> TDC Group in Denmark. 
    The returns look good if consumers’ demand for fast internet
access means they switch from the copper networks run by
incumbent operators like BT Group <BT.L>. Assume a new player
like CityFibre spends 550 pounds per home and builds half a
million connections a year. Next, assume 40 percent of
households take up the service, and CityFibre charges 14 pounds
per customer, and makes an EBITDA margin of 70 percent. 
    Fast forward six years, and the operator would have 3
million lines, 202 million pounds of revenue, and 141 million
pounds of EBITDA. The total cost of building the network would
be 1.65 billion pounds, although perhaps 60 percent of that
could be funded by debt, reducing the equity cheque to 660
million pounds. If the operator can sell the business at an
infrastructure-like multiple of 15 times EBITDA, the business
could be sold for 2.1 billion pounds, and the equity would have
nearly doubled to 1.1 billion pounds, equivalent to an internal
rate of return of around 16 percent. 
    It sounds easy, but there are a couple of snags. Competitors
may invest in the same regions, leading to a lower uptake and
more humdrum returns. That’s why some funds are focusing on
small towns, where they hope to build a monopoly. But incumbent
operators like BT may have an interest in preserving a national
position, resulting in excess capacity. 
    Consumers also need to play ball. The existing copper
networks may be good enough for many households’ needs to stream
movies and surf the web, making them reluctant to switch. Over
time, demand for data should skyrocket as everyday objects from
fridges to cars are connected to the internet. But private
equity may have a longer wait than expected.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - CityFibre, a British broadband operator backed by Goldman
Sachs, said on Oct. 23 it would spend 2.5 billion pounds ($3.25
billion) on rolling out fibre networks in 37 towns and cities.
It hopes to offer connections to as many as 5 million homes. 
    - The company, which was bought by Goldman Sachs West Street
Infrastructure Partners and private equity firm Antin for $750
million earlier this year, is taking on national provider BT
Group. 
    - CityFibre said its networks, which offer gigabit speeds,
would help deliver one third of the government's 2025 target of
connecting 15 million homes. The company has previously said the
cost of reaching each home will be between 350 pounds and 480
pounds.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The value of euro zone banks
<.SX7E> have collapsed by a third since markets touched their
peak at the end of January, data showed on Wednesday, as another
quarter of disappointing profits at Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>
dragged the region's sector down. 
    European banks shares, which have never reclaimed their
pre-financial crisis prices, have been the worst performing
sector  so far in the monetary block this year, down 26.5
percent as investors shed assets seen as most vulnerable to
political upheaval.
    ""The fall is not justified by a similar drop in earnings,""
commented Farhad Moshiri, an analyst covering European banks at
Alphavalue, arguing that political risk had a stronger negative
impact than sector results.
    Still, Deutsche's bleak results and revenue forecast on
Wednesday, which sent shares down 5 percent for their worst day
since end-May, deepened the sector-wide rout. [nL8N1X40FI]
    The Spring political crisis in Italy and the following
on-going row with the European Commission about the country's
populist government's budget took a heavy toll, particularly on
Italian banks. 
    The latters are heavily exposed to Italian sovereign debt,
which has shed value since the country decided to raise spending
and put an end to years of fiscal prudence.
    Slowing economic growth on the continent and elusive
monetary normalisation, with a first interest rate hike by the
European Central Bank (ECB) still far away, also weighed on
stock prices.
    A long series of compliance fiascos, the latest being the
money laundering scandal at Denmark's largest bank, Danske Bank
<DANSKE.CO>, have also made investors mistrustful and weary of 
remaining skeletons in the banks' coffers.   
    Attracted by their low valuations and growing dividend
yields, a number of fund managers have placed bets on a revival
of European banks but without lasting success so far.

 (Adds detail on UK ministers, updates prices)
    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The pound fell to a seven-week
low on Wednesday before British Prime Minister Theresa May was
due to meet Conservative Party lawmakers, some of whom have
discussed toppling her in anger at her Brexit negotiations.
    May is seeking to win over lawmakers in her party who oppose
her approach to the negotiations, which are stuck at an impasse
just over five months before the United Kingdom leaves the
European Union. 
    The prospect of a leadership challenge and of politics
scuppering an agreement with the EU has weakened the currency in
recent days.
    Sterling fell on Wednesday to $1.2889, its lowest since
Sept. 5, and traded down 0.7 percent <GBP=D3>. Against a weaker
euro, the pound was flat at 88.31 pence <EURGBP=D3>. 
    ""Sterling [traders] are parsing the words coming out of
Westminster and Brussels but the issue is that the range of
final outcomes is very broad,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of
global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
    ""We are still stuck in the $1.28 to $1.32 range. The answer
for investors is to stay close to benchmark or slightly short,""
he said.
    Some of May's senior ministers and lawmakers from the
Northern Irish party that props up her government were seen
entering her Downing Street residence on Wednesday, a Reuters
photographer said. [nL9N1W701W]
    Disagreement on a fallback plan for the border between
Northern Ireland and Ireland is a key sticking point in the
Brexit talks.
    A Downing Street spokesman, however, said May -- due to
address her divided party's powerful ""1922 Committee"" later on
Wednesday -- meets cabinet ministers all the time.
     If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in
the short term because her replacement could increase the
chances of a no-deal Brexit, said David Cheetham, chief market
analyst at broker XTB.
    But the pound ""remains more sensitive to good news than bad
which may mean a fairly sharp move higher should a [Brexit]
agreement be reached.  
    ""May's position is similar to that of the pound in that it
seems to be carrying on despite the sizable challenges faced,""
Cheetham added.
    Sterling briefly gained half a percent against the dollar
and euro on Tuesday after a media report that the EU could offer
May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal.

DATA ADEQUACY

The majority of the underlying assets or risk-presenting entities have ratings 
or credit opinions from Fitch and/or other Nationally Recognised Statistical 
Rating Organisations and/or European Securities and Markets Authority-registered 
rating agencies. Fitch has relied on the practices of the relevant groups within 
Fitch and/or other rating agencies to assess the asset portfolio information. 

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable.

obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000

DATA ADEQUACY

The majority of the underlying assets or risk-presenting entities have ratings 
or credit opinions from Fitch and/or other Nationally Recognised Statistical 
Rating Organisations and/or European Securities and Markets Authority-registered 
rating agencies. Fitch has relied on the practices of the relevant groups within 
Fitch and/or other rating agencies to assess the asset portfolio information. 

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement

of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are

factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the

ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The

    By Josephine Mason and Danilo Masoni
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - UK shares ended well off highs on
Wednesday but still managed to recover from the previous day's
seven-month lows, as a stronger U.S. dollar boosted consumer
goods makers.
    The FTSE 100 <.FTSE> was up just 0.1 percent at the close
after rising 1.3 percent at one point during the session. 
    The index tracked a sudden turn in global stocks that
dragged the Dow Jones and the broader European stock market into
negative territory following a positive open. 
    ""The main problem is that overall sentiment is very negative
this has been made worse in the last few days by the fact that
on a technical level sell signals have been generated,"" said
Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets.
    ""There is too much uncertainty out there in regard to a
Brexit deal, possible trade wars, Italian budget, Turkey,
disappointing earnings, Fed tightening too aggressively, just to
name a few,"" he added.
    These worries made traders risk averse, prompting them to
take profit to reduce their overnight exposure, Huber said.
     The mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.3 percent after hitting its
lowest levels since February 2017 on Tuesday.    
    Among the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 were
multinationals with less exposure to the pound <GBP=> Diageo
<DGE.L> and Reckitt Benckiser <RB.L>, up 0.7 and 2.2 percent
respectively.
    The pound eased to seven-week lows ahead of Prime Minister
Theresa May's address to restive Conservative Party lawmakers on
her Brexit strategy later in the day. [nL8N1X36GK]
    The FTSE 100, which is on track for its worst monthly
performance since 2012, derives 70 percent of its profits from
overseas.
    Luxury goods maker Burberry <BRBY.L>, up 0.1 percent, was
supported by a positive third-quarter report and rosy outlook on
China, the world's second-largest economy, from French luxury
goods company and owner of the Gucci brand Kering <PRTP.PA>.
[nP6N1W701P]
    A broadly confident outlook helped Barclays Bank <BARC.L>
rise 2.9 percent [nL8N1X41FQ]
    But competition in the UK mortgage market hit Metro Bank
<MTRO.L>, which sank 12.3 percent to the bottom of the midcap
index, set for its biggest one-day drop in more than two years.
[nL8N1X41Z1] 
    Stobart Group <STOB.L> fell 5.3 percent after its interim
earnings report. [nASP0001N4]

    RIYADH, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman on Wednesday joked about Lebanese Prime Minister Saad
al-Hariri's detention in the kingdom last year, saying he was
free to leave after attending an international investment
conference in Riyadh.
    ""Prime Minister Saad is staying in the kingdom for two days
so I hope you don't spread rumours that he was kidnapped,"" he
said during a panel discussion at the event.
    Hariri, sitting beside the crown prince, commonly known as
MbS, took part in the humour as the audience laughed. ""With all
my freedom,"" he said.
    Hariri, who has Saudi citizenship, was summoned to Riyadh a
year ago, briefly detained and compelled to resign as prime
minister in a speech read out on television from Saudi until
France intervened to free him.
    The joke took place as the Crown Prince comes under mounting
global pressure to come up with answers over the killing of
Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul on Oct 2. 
    During the panel discussion, he said ""justice will prevail""
and the culprits would be punished in his most high profile
comments since U.S. resident Khashoggi, a critic of the crown
prince, was killed.
    Hours earlier U.S. President Donald Trump, in his toughest
comments yet, told the Wall Street Journal that the crown prince
bore ultimate responsibility for the operation that led to
Khashoggi's killing.
    The kingdom has survived other crises, including the fallout
of the short-lived kidnapping of Hariri.
    Hariri was verbally humiliated and beaten, according to
eight Saudi, Arab and Western diplomatic sources.

worth 500 million euros ($569 million) with an interest rate of
6.75 percent, a government official said on Wednesday.
    The country had originally planned to sell bonds worth $1
billion.
    The official said 120 investors made offers and the value of
the offers for Tunisia reached 1.25 billion euros.
    Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup and Natixis

    PRAGUE, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The Czech parliament's lower
house approved the government's draft 2019 central budget in a
first reading on Wednesday, setting the deficit target at 40
billion crowns ($1.78 billion). 
    Parliamentary committees will now review the budget before
sending it back to the house for a final reading. Wednesday's
vote, however, means the deficit goal is already locked in.
    The draft budget prepared by the minority centre-left
government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis forecasts state
revenue of 1.47 trillion crowns next year and net inflows of
European Union funding of 48.6 billion crowns.
    Lawmakers in the 200-seat lower house voted 101 in favour of
the bill and 83 against. The Communist party, which helped the
government win a confidence vote in July, backed the finance
plan. 
    While the central budget is seen clocking a deficit, the
bill envisions a surplus for the overall public sector -- which
also includes regional budgets and the national healthcare
system -- equivalent to 1.0 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), down from the 1.6 percent targeted in 2018.
    Babis's government is planning to boost spending, including
pensions, which critics say could cause complicate state finance
if the current economic growth cycle runs out of steam.
    This year's central budget was planned with a deficit of 50
billion crowns but solid economic growth, improved tax
collection and inflow of European Union subsidies may bring it
to balance.

    By John Irish
    PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it could
impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia if its intelligence services
find the kingdom was behind the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, even
as Paris worked to maintain important business and strategic
ties with Riyadh.
    French reaction has been relatively guarded to date, as
Paris sought to retain its influence with Riyadh and protect
commercial relations spanning energy, finance and arms.
    ""As long as the facts have not been clearly established, and
corroborated by our information services, we will not take any
decision,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.
    ""On the other hand, once light has been shed on the matter
and has been corroborated by our services, based on the
hypothesis that Saudi Arabia's responsibility has been proved,
then we would draw the necessary conclusions and impose
appropriate sanctions,"" he said.
    Any steps would not just involve sanctions on arms sales he
said, without elaborating.
    Earlier, a French presidency source said there would be no
""hasty decision"".
    Other major Western allies of Saudi Arabia have already
spoken out. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may be behind Khashoggi's
death. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called Khashoggi's
killing a ""monstrosity"" and vowed to halt German arms exports. 
    Britain, like France a major weapons supplier to the
kingdom, has said a Saudi explanation that Khashoggi died in a
fight in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul were not credible.
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday Britain would
prevent all suspects in his death from entering the UK.
    
    BALANCING ACT
    A senior French diplomat acknowledged President Emmanuel
Macron was treading a thin line in pursuing his long-stated
policy of avoiding taking no sides between Sunni Saudi Arabia
and Shi'ite Iran.
    ""We're a bit in the shit because of this,"" he said,
referring to the Khashoggi furore. ""We have an important
partnership, but while we never considered Saudi to be the
cradle of human rights, this is serious. It can't be ignored.
There will be consequences, but we need to be prudent.""
    Since coming to power last year, Macron has largely ignored
protests over arms sales he deems vital to jobs and France's
strategic relationships in the region.
    From 2008 to 2017, Saudi Arabia was the second biggest
purchaser of French arms, with deals totalling some 11 billion
euros ($12.67 billion), including 1.5 billion last year alone. 
    Reflecting the range of French commercial interests in the
region, the head of French oil company Total was attending the
Future Investment conference in Riyadh, a meeting boycotted by a
number of his peers in the wake of the Khashoggi killing.
    Macron considers Riyadh vital to help forge a region-wide
peace deal with Iran, as well as an ally in the fight against
Islamist militants from the Middle East to West Africa, and a
rampart against the Muslim Brotherhood.
    ""The sale of weapons is something very political and part of
a long-term vision,"" said Camille Lons, a researcher at the
European Council on Foreign Relations. 
    ""Saudi Arabia is present across the region, so if there were
to be complications in diplomatic relations it could have an
impact on several regional theatres."" 
    
    ALLIANCE OF YOUTH
    At the heart of Macron's strategy is Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman, often referred to as MbS, who has painted himself as
a reformer but is under scrutiny over Khashoggi's death. 
    During a visit to France this year Macron urged detractors
to give time to the 33-year-old leader-in-waiting. [nL8N1RN6ZZ] 
 
    ""The challenge is not to lose MbS. A loss of influence in
the region would cost us much more than the lack of arms sales,""
a French minister said on condition of anonymity.
    Macron has sought to play down the importance of economic
relations and instead played up the strategic partnership.
    ""Paris — while projecting its outward image of a beacon of
liberalism and idealism — is deeply interested in getting even
closer to the current rulers in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,"" said 
Jalel Harchaoui, geopolitics lecturer at Versailles University.
    ""The dominant perception is that both leaders are dynamic
and assertive while the Khashoggi affair is just a temporary
crisis during which no mistakes must be made.""

    NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Wednesday as stocks fell and after European data signaled that
economic growth could be flagging across the euro zone, denting
the euro.
    The S&P 500 <.SPX> was on track for a sixth day of losses as
weak forecasts from chipmakers added to concerns about the
impact on earnings from tariffs and a slowdown in China's
economy. [nL2N1X41ON]
    A flight to safety boosted the dollar index, which rose 0.54
percent against a basket of six rival currencies to 96.438
<.DXY>. The Japanese yen, another safe-haven currency often
bought when broader markets slide, strengthened over the day to
112.23, up 2 percent from a trough on Oct. 4. <JPY=> 
    Euro zone business growth slowed more than expected this
month, a widely watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey
showed. German private-sector growth fell to its lowest in more
than three years, and manufacturing in France hit a 25-month
low, according to other surveys. [nL9N1T2014][nL9N1T2013]
[nL9N1T2012] 
    Against the dollar, the euro fell as much as 0.8 percent,
breaking below the technically significant level of $1.14. It
was last at $1.139 and headed towards its biggest daily loss
since Sept 27 <EUR=>.
    The European reports ""came in weaker than expected and
suggest that some of the softness we saw in Q2 and Q3 may not be
as temporary as people were assuming,"" said Daniel Katzive, head
of foreign exchange strategy for North American at BNP Paribas. 
     ""Even though the U.S. is starting to show some cracks and
vulnerability to global trade and geopolitical stresses, Europe
is still more vulnerable from an economic perspective."" 
    The European Central Bank holds its monetary policy meeting
on Thursday, and investors will be looking for any comments
about the deepening row between the European Union and Italy
over Rome's budget.
    The British pound hit a six-week low of $1.287 earlier in
the day as markets awaited the outcome of Prime Minister Theresa
May's meeting with Parliament after talk of a leadership
challenge over her Brexit strategy <GBP=>. [nL8N1X457G]
    May received a show of support from her Conservative Party
on Wednesday, which lifted the pound modestly but left it down
0.77 percent over the day. It was last at $1.288.
    The Canadian dollar fell by as much as 0.91 percent on
Wednesday morning after the country's central bank raised
interest rates as expected and said more hikes would be needed
to keep inflation in check <CAD=>. The loonie had retraced some
of its losses in the afternoon session, and was last at $1.302.

    * Think-tank plan goes much further than EU planned reform
    * Some EU states are weak links, don't publish fines -report

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Union should set
up a new agency to counter money laundering after a series of
high-profile cases at banks bared weaknesses in the system, an
influential think-tank said in a report, urging full disclosure
of fines imposed on wrongdoers.
    Over the last months, lenders in Denmark, Estonia, Latvia,
Luxembourg, Malta, Spain, the Netherlands, Britain and Cyprus
have been embroiled in money laundering scandals, with criminal
schemes often executed through foreign branches within the EU.
    Increased media attention to recent cases has pushed EU
regulators to discuss limited changes to the bloc's legal
framework, but proposals to slightly increase the monitoring
powers of the European Banking Authority (EBA) face opposition
in some member states [nL8N1W74DQ].
    However, the reform should go much further than what is
currently discussed, experts at the Brussels-based think-tank
Bruegel said in a report on Thursday.
    ""It is evident that recent anti-money laundering supervision
in the EU has been embarrassingly ineffective, and that deep
reform thus needs to be considered,"" Joshua Kirschenbaum and
Nicolas Veron wrote in the Bruegel paper titled: ""A better
European Union architecture to fight money laundering.""
    European Union diplomats have been briefed on the content of
the paper in recent meetings as they prepare an action plan on
money laundering by the end of the year.
    The Bruegel document urges the creation of a new European
anti-money laundering authority with several hundred staff.
    The plan is far more ambitious than legislative proposals
put forward by the European Commission in September which would
raise to 12 the total number of EU staff dealing with money
laundering at the bloc's banks, and would leave most powers in
the hands of member states. 
    
    WEAK LINKS
    But the authors of the report say the establishment of a new
authority would be easier and more effective than extending the
powers of existing agencies, and would replicate the successful
common supervision of financial risks at euro zone banks
conducted by the European Central Bank. 
    The ECB has repeatedly endorsed the idea of a single money
laundering body.
    An EU-wide agency would break the ""weak links"" in some EU
countries ""where money launderers tend to concentrate their
activity"", in some cases even with the complicity of
governments, the report said, without naming specific states.
    The establishment of the new body would take time, likely up
to 2022, ""but the decision to set it up need not be postponed,""
the report said. 
    The new agency would also favour an improvement of EU rules
against money laundering, which are currently insufficient and
applied inconsistently in EU states, the authors said.
    Exploiting loopholes in EU rules, states can currently
decide on their own the size and publication of fines for banks
involved in money laundering. 
    Denmark, Spain and Germany do not expose sanctioned banks,
while other states like Luxembourg decide case-by-case, despite
international guidelines that recommend publication of all
sanctions as a key step toward deterring financial crime.
[nL8N1WV4HJ]
    This situation would change with a new authority that
publishes all its sanction decisions and imposes sufficiently
large fines to discourage malfeasance, the report concluded.

    * Might formalise December exit from asset purchase scheme
    * This would send signal to Rome in budget row with Brussels

    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
seems certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but likely to
acknowledge the growth outlook is deteriorating, even if not yet
enough to derail a carefully crafted retreat from stimulus. 
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with four years of
unprecedented support, the ECB will reaffirm its asset purchases
are set to end this year but also note that uncertainty is on
the rise in the euro zone, giving its policy outlook a dovish
undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively benign with policymakers looking
for only small and infrequent moves from late next year as the
bloc's economic expansion slows back to what is considered its
natural potential after an exceptional run last year.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, the escalating political fight between
Rome and Brussels will also be on the central bank's agenda.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi, himself an Italian, may repeat that
no individual member state can expect its help, particularly one
whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union rules. 
    ""The ECB seems determined to end its net asset purchases –
almost no matter what,"" Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. 
    ""If anything, expect a re-assessment of risks: The ECB could
downgrade the risks to the outlook from broadly balanced to
tilted to the downside.""   
    But investors might take a change of risk assessment as a
sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is not prepared for
that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, the ECB could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private say that the bar
on extending the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme is
very high and it was too early to reassess the interest rate
guidance, which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer.
    They are also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
    The ECB announces its policy decision at 1145 GMT, followed
by Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by
Reuters are unanimous in expecting rates to stay unchanged and
for the bond buys to end in December. [nL3N1WV48S]
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-offs could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    To send that signal more explicitly to Rome, the ECB could
formalise its decision to end bond purchases as soon as Thursday
rather than, as generally expected, defer it until December.
    ""The ECB would likely be reluctant to help a government that
is in open and deliberate breach of the rules,"" BNP Paribas said
in a note to clients. ""Just as importantly, it would not want to
be seen to be doing so.""
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new
emission standards could also dent third quarter growth with
reverberating effects for the wider economy. 
    Beyond the broader economic outlook, the ECB may also debate
tweaks to policy on reinvesting cash from maturing debt, as
flagged by Draghi last month.
    While that decision is also not expected until December, the
ECB could already decide on Thursday to emphasize that it will
remain in the bond market for years to come with enough
firepower to smooth periods of stress.
    Yet changes in reinvestments are expected to be mostly
technical to ensure smooth implementation of ECB policies as
bonds often mature in large chunks.

    BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - London copper prices fell for a
third straight session on Thursday, hitting a two-week low as
the metal considered to be an economic bellwether tracked a
slump in global equity markets.
    Copper has been losing ground on concerns of a slowdown in
top metals consumer China, which pledged to support illiquid
private companies after third-quarter GDP growth slowed to 6.5
percent, the lowest since 2009. [nL3N1WZ3O8]
    ""Macro headlines have been unhelpful, and commentary from
some industrial companies about weaker Chinese demand is adding
fuel to the fire,"" Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina wrote
in a note. 
    Import premiums in China <SMM-CUYP-CN> have fallen to
$112.50 per tonne, the lowest since Sept. 19, after hitting
three-year highs of $120 a tonne late last month.

    FUNDAMENTALS
    * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange <CMCU3> slipped as much a 1 percent to $6,115 a tonne,
the lowest since Oct. 11, and was down 0.7 percent at $6,138.50
a tonne as of 0451 GMT.  
    * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded December copper contract on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange <SCFcv1> was also down for a third
day, falling as much as 1.5 percent to 49,360 yuan ($7,109.73) a
tonne, its weakest since Sept. 21, before trimming losses to 0.8
percent by the mid-session interval. 
    * OTHER METALS: Shanghai nickel <SNIcv1> slumped as much as
2.8 percent to 100,160 yuan a tonne, the lowest since Sept. 12,
before cutting losses to 1.1 percent, while lead <SPBcv1> and
aluminium <SAFcv1> moved higher after drops in LME stocks on
Wednesday.
    * COPPER: Freeport-McMoRan Inc <FCX.N> on Wednesday reported
market-beating results as output and grades at its big
Indonesian mine rose, but early share gains turned negative as
investors digested forecasts for the world's biggest public
copper miner. [nL3N1X44B1]

    By Swati Pandey
    SYDNEY, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares plunged on Thursday
as hundreds of billions of dollars haemorrhaged from global
markets after a rout in tech stocks inflicted the largest daily
decline on Wall Street since 2011, wiping out all its gains for
the year.
    Stock investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty
equities valuations, a likely peak in corporate earnings
momentum, faster rate hikes in the United States and an ongoing
Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth.
    Spreadbetters pointed to a subdued start for European
markets with London's FTSE index <.FTSE>, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI>
 <.DAX> and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> all set to open in the red.
FTSE futures <FFIc1> were last down 0.9 percent. E-Minis for the
S&P500 <ESC1> were flat after being up as much as 0.4 percent
earlier in the day.    
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> skidded more than 2 percent and has now lost
more than 18.5 percent of its value so far this year.
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> tumbled as much as 4 percent to a
six-month trough while the Topix index <.TOPX> plunged 3
percent, evaporating more than $155 billion in market value.
[nL3N1X51KR]
    Chinese shares too were in the red with the blue-chip index
<.SSEC> plummeting as much as 2.5 percent as fresh
market-support measures by the Chinese government failed to ease
worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the United
States. [nL3N1X51LA][nH9N1WZ024]
    The index did pare some of its losses and was last down 1.2
percent.
    ""If you're a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget
there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms
of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,"" said Jim McCafferty, head
of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.
    ""How, as a management team, will you decide how much capex
to invest and where to invest it?""
    Some companies, including industrial bellwether Caterpillar
<CAT.N>, have already warned about the impact on business from
U.S. import tariffs. [nL3N1X44CY]
    ""Now that markets have some element of the confirmation that
tariffs are bringing actual impact to U.S. corporates, there may
be a snowflake causing the avalanche scenario as just another
factor of worry that now needs to be taken into consideration,""
said James Stanley, market strategist at DailyFX.
    He noted that those bearish on equities were better off
focusing outside the United States, at least for now, with
Europe one of the weaker links in global stock markets.
    The return of the bears has already been more pronounced
outside the United States, according to data analysed by
Reuters. In addition, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch study
recently found that 58 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI's
global index are now in bear market territory. [nL8N1X36CB]
    Weak readings on manufacturing in Europe have added to angst
over world growth, as has a surprise slump in U.S. home sales,
which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for
housing. [nL2N1X31LR]
    Adding to the air of tension, police intercepted suspected
bombs mailed to former U.S. President Barack Obama, Hillary
Clinton and other high-profile Democrats, as well as to CNN, in
what New York officials branded an act of terrorism.
[nL2N1X40R5]
    The growing international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the
death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi also weighed on investor
sentiment. [nL8N1X4784]
    On Wednesday, the Nasdaq <.IXIC> plunged 4.4 percent in its
biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug. 18, 2011,
vaporising $524 billion in market capitalisation.
    The Dow <.DJI > fell 2.4 percent and the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost
3.09 percent.
    Also weighing on sentiment, Citi lowered its global growth
forecast for both 2019 and 2020 by 0.1 percentage point each to
3.2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, according to a note
published Thursday.
    
    CURRENCIES
    In foreign exchange markets, funds flowed to the U.S. dollar
and Treasuries and out of the euro and the British pound. 
    The euro shed 0.7 percent to $1.1397 <EUR=> and breached a
major chart bulwark at $1.1430. It was last up 0.1 percent at
$1.1407. 
    Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a
nine-week peak to 96.296 <.DXY>. [USD/]
    Sterling hit a seven-week trough $1.2865 <GBP=>, having
dropped 0.8 percent overnight. It was last a shade higher at
$1.2886.
    The yen got the usual safe-haven bid, with the euro skidding
to a two-month low at 127.68 yen <EURJPY=>. Even the high-flying
dollar eased to 112.02 yen <JPY=>.
    Oil prices slipped amid concerns over global growth.     
Brent crude <LCOc1> fell 44 cents to $75.73 a barrel, while 
U.S. crude dropped 45 cents to $66.37 <CLc1>. [O/R]
    Spot gold <XAU=> was a tad firmer at $1,236.76 an ounce.

    * Canal+ has lost over 1 million French subscribers since
2013
    * 'Invisibles' is its first African feature length drama

    By Aaron Ross
    ABIDJAN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - On a muddy side-street in
Abidjan, Alex Ogou directs his cast of young locals in a TV
drama about gangsters in Ivory Coast that French media giant
Vivendi hopes will help revive its fortunes.
    ""Invisibles"" is the first original series produced in Africa
by Vivendi's <VIV.PA> pay-TV company Canal+ and is part of a
drive to attract viewers on the continent in the face of growing
Chinese competition and as subscribers at home cancel contracts.
    Canal+ has lost 1.3 million individual subscribers in
mainland France since 2013 due to stiff competition for rights
to sports events, series from upstart rivals and the rise of
streaming services such as Netflix <NFLX.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O>.
    At the same time, Canal+ has added twice as many subscribers
in Africa, now its second-largest market. Rights to European and
African soccer have long been a draw in Africa and Canal+ has
also invested heavily in locally produced content. 
    But unlike the tried and tested telenovelas and tales of
witchcraft that account for an outsized portion of African TV
consumption, ""Invisibles"" tells the story of a violent gang of
youngsters in 10 episodes of 52 minutes. 
    Shot mainly in a bustling sprawl of open-air markets and
run-down auto body shops in the working-class Yopougon district,
the series will debut in Africa on Oct. 29.
    ""Africans want us to address them directly and not offer
them programmes that reference things they don't know, just
because that's what's shown in Paris,"" said Fabrice Faux, Canal+
International's chief content officer.
    ""The African public wants things made by them, for them and,
if possible, on site,"" he said.

    'FASTEST GROWTH'
    Vivendi said in February that Canal+ aimed to add 1.5
million African subscribers by 2020 to bring the total to about
5 million, up from some 1 million five years ago. [nFWN1Q906Q]  
  
    With more Africans buying TVs - and streaming services not
widely accessible due to relatively high data costs - the
continent is fertile ground for satellite pay-TV companies to
provide original content and generate customer loyalty. 
    ""It is a market that is very important for us. It is the
market with the fastest growth,"" said Faux.
    Besides ""Invisibles"", at least two more African-produced
series are in the works, a Senegalese police drama called ""Sakho
& Mangane"" and an action series called ""African Special Forces""
which Canal+ is co-producing with a Moroccan station.
    Series are also cheaper to produce in Africa than Europe or
the United States, sometimes by a factor of 40. Karamoko Toure,
the ""Invisibles"" producer, said it cost about $1 million.
    And it is already attracting plaudits. Last month, it became
the first francophone African series to win an award outside the
continent at the TV Fiction Festival http://www.festival-fictiontv.com/en/home-2
 in the French city of La Rochelle.
    Canal+'s success in Africa, where it has nearly 4 million
subscribers across more than 25 countries contrasts with its
struggles in France and largely stable business in its other
main markets, Poland and Vietnam.
    Canal+ is Vivendi's second-highest grossing company behind
Universal Music so its welfare is key. In 2015, the
haemorrhaging of French subscribers from Canal+ became so
alarming Vivendi said it could not finance the company's losses
in the long run.
    
    PRESTIGE PLAY
    Last year, it said a turnaround plan emphasising themed
packages had staunched the bleeding: sales were growing again,
cancellations were declining and partnerships with mobile
operators such as Orange <ORAN.PA> and Bouygues Telecom
<BOUY.PA> were profitable.
    Even so, Canal+ has shed nearly 200,000 subscribers in
France over the past year. In May, it lost out on broadcast
rights in France for the national soccer league for 2020-24,
which sent Vivendi's shares tumbling 5.5 percent. [nL5N1T1222]  
          
    One advantage Canal+ has over new entrants is strong brand
recognition built up over three decades in francophone Africa,
where a white Canal+ dish is a status symbol.  
    ""Here, prestige can be seen. Canal+ and its satellite dish
are prestigious,"" said Ndeye Diagne, a managing director at
marketing research firm Kantar TNS http://www.tnsglobal.com in
Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan. ""They must not lose
that.""
    Originally-produced comedy and news programmes, as well as
A+, an all-Africa channel Canal+ launched in 2014, have enjoyed
success. It also carries a range of African telenovelas, which
are heavily advertised on billboards around Abidjan.   
    The move to feature-length dramas such as ""Invisibles"" is 
something of a leap into the unknown but French-Ivorian director
Ogou thinks it will resonate widely.
    ""People are looking for things to watch that concern them
... Talking about stories in which people can recognise
themselves.""
    
    CHINESE COMPETITION
    Success in Africa has not come easy. To help attract more
subscribers, Canal+ slashed prices about five years ago, Faux
said, without providing exact figures.  
    According to company data, the average African subscriber
brings in less than half the revenue of a French customer - and
Africa still only accounts for 10.6 percent of Canal+ revenues.
    Canal+ also faces growing competition from Chinese rival
StarTimes, which began operating in Africa in 2002 and is
pushing deeper into francophone markets.
    With nearly 10 million subscribers across 30 African
countries, it is challenging the long-time dominance of Canal+
in French-speaking countries and MultiChoice's <IPO-MGROUPJ.J>
DStv https://www.dstv.com in anglophone markets.
    Philippe Zou, director general for StarTimes in francophone
Africa, said its strategy was focused on content in African
languages such as Swahili and Yoruba, televising domestic soccer
leagues and offering more programmes online.
    StarTimes entered Ivory Coast two years ago and has made
inroads with monthly plans from 4,500 CFA francs to 15,000 CFA
($8.02-$26.73), compared with Canal+'s 5,000 CFA to 40,000. 
    By the end of the year, London-based Digital TV Research
Limited estimates that Canal+ will have 579,000 subscribers in
Ivory Coast and StarTimes 125,000. Competition remains fierce
and original content may help win the fight.
    At a Canal+ retailer in Abidjan's Cocody district, where TV
boxes were on sale for 15,000 CFA in a promotion, saleswoman
Rachel Kouame said business was brisk.   
    ""There are some clients who have left for StarTimes but many
of them come back. They say they prefer our programming.""

    * Might formalise December exit from asset purchase scheme
    * This would send signal to Rome in budget row with Brussels

 (Adds markets, quote)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
seems certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but it is
likely to acknowledge the growth outlook is deteriorating, even
if not yet by enough to derail a carefully crafted retreat from
stimulus. 
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with four years of
unprecedented support, the ECB will reaffirm its asset purchases
are set to end this year but also note that uncertainty is on
the rise in the euro zone, giving its policy outlook a dovish
undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively limited with policymakers making
only small and infrequent moves from late next year as the
bloc's economic expansion slows to what is considered its
natural potential rate after an exceptional run last year.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, the escalating political fight between
Rome and Brussels will also be on the central bank's agenda.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi, himself an Italian, may repeat that
no individual member state can expect its help, particularly one
whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union rules. 
    ""The ECB seems determined to end its net asset purchases –
almost no matter what,"" Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. 
    ""If anything, expect a re-assessment of risks: The ECB could
downgrade the risks to the outlook from broadly balanced to
tilted to the downside.""   
    But investors might take a change of risk assessment as a
sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is not prepared for
that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, the ECB could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private say that the bar
for extending the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme
is very high and it was too early to reassess interest rate
guidance, which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer.
    They are also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
    The ECB announces its policy decision at 1145 GMT, followed
by Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by
Reuters are unanimous in expecting rates to stay unchanged and
for the bond buys to end in December. [nL3N1WV48S]
    Italian government bond yields hovered just below 4-1/2
years high at 0639 GMT.
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-offs could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    To send that signal more explicitly to Rome, the ECB could
formalise its decision to end bond purchases as soon as Thursday
rather than, as generally expected, defer it until December.
    ""The ECB would likely be reluctant to help a government that
is in open and deliberate breach of the rules,"" BNP Paribas said
in a note to clients. ""Just as importantly, it would not want to
be seen to be doing so.""
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new
emission standards could also dent third quarter growth with
reverberating effects for the wider economy. 
    Beyond the broader economic outlook, the ECB may also debate
tweaks to policy on reinvesting cash from maturing debt,
particularly government debt bought as part of its Public Sector
Purchase Programme (PSPP).
    While that decision is also not expected until December, the
ECB could decide on Thursday to emphasize that it will remain in
the bond market for years to come with enough firepower to
smooth periods of stress.
    Yet changes in reinvestments are expected to be mostly
technical to ensure smooth implementation of ECB policies as
bonds often mature in large chunks.
    ""We expect the ECB will signal it aims to minimise the
roll-down of its PSPP portfolio... by targeting long-dated bond
in its reinvestments,"" analysts at brokerage Mizuho wrote in a
note to clients.

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Hungarian bond prices firmed
slightly ahead of the government's bi-weekly auctions on
Thursday, expected to attract healthy demand despite jitters in
global markets.
    After a slump in Wall Street technology shares knocked world
stocks lower, Bucharest led a decline in Central Europe. 
    Its main index <.BETI>, which has outperformed regional
peers in the past weeks, fell 1.2 percent by 0750 GMT,
continuing to retreat from last week's 5-month highs.
    The bluechip index of Warsaw <.WIG20>, the region's biggest
stock market, hit a 4-month low, falling by 0.7 percent.  
    Risk aversion in the world also weighed on Central European
currencies, mainly the forint <EURHUF=> and <EURPLN=>, which
eased in tandem by 0.2 percent against the euro.
    Trading at 323.6 and 4.3140, respectively, they were still
near the past few weeks' typical ranges, and the weakening is
unlikely to dampen appetite for the bonds offered at Hungary's
auctions, one Budapest-based trader said.
    ""I expect relatively strong demand near the current
secondary market yields,"" the trader said.
    ""Interest rate payments (on government debt) this week and
next are boosting liquidity, while some of the 2018/D bond
expiry worth 150 billion forints can be also reinvested,"" the
trader added.
    Hungarian government bond yields were lower by a 1-3 basis
points, after an about 5 basis point decline on Wednesday, with
the 10-year paper trading at 3.73 percent.
    The forint is moving in an ""acceptable and tolerable"" range
for the central bank, rate-setter Gyula Pleschinger was quoted
late on Wednesday as saying.
    He also said the bank should not start to increase interest
rates before unwinding the monetary stimulus built up through
its unconventional tools.
    The European Central Bank's comments after its interest rate
decision will be closely watched, but are unlikely to change
sentiment, market participants said.
    ""I do not expect hawkish comments,"" the trader said.

    OSLO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank kept interest
rates on hold at 0.75 percent on Thursday, as expected, and
repeated an outlook for gradual hikes from the first quarter
next year amid faster economic growth and higher inflation.
    Norges Bank hiked rates for the first time in seven years in
September and said rates would most likely rise further in the
first quarter next year.
    ""Economic growth has been a little lower and inflation
somewhat higher than projected, but the outlook and the balance

September report,"" the bank said in a statement.
    ""The outlook and balance of risks imply a gradual increase
in the key policy rate,"" it added.

the announcement, trading at 9.5044 against the euro at 0813 GMT
from 9.5191 earlier.
    The bank's decision was unanimous and as expected by
economists polled by Reuters.[nL8N1WV1LA]

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields
fell on Thursday as a global equity sell-off fuelled a dash for
debt and investors awaited a meeting of the European Central
Bank. 
    The ECB is expected to keep policy unchanged, but it meets
at a time when markets are blighted by doubts about economic
growth, a spat between Rome and Brussels over Italy's budget and
big declines on Wall Street. 
    The equity worries drove U.S. Treasury yields to their
lowest since early October. A risk-off mood is supporting the
prices of ""safe"" bonds and driving down yields.
    The ECB is likely to be concerned by this week's purchasing
managers' data, which that showed growth in the euro zone lost
more momentum than expected, pointing to the slowest quarterly
growth in more than two years. [nL9N1T2014]
    Analysts expect the ECB to acknowledge a worsening growth
outlook, but do not expect the global concerns to derail its
planned retreat from monetary stimulus. [nL8N1X44VJ]
    The ECB is widely expected to end its asset purchase
programme this year, though there is little detail on its
planned reinvestment strategy.
   ""On the QE reinvestment strategy for 2019, the first hints
that it was at least discussed should be expected – full clarity
will likely come in December,"" ING analysts wrote in a note to
clients on Thursday. 
    European money markets, meanwhile, have pushed back
expectations of a rate increase and no longer fully price in an
rise until October 2019. Until last week, they priced in a hike
for next September. <ECBWATCH> 
    Money markets now suggest around a 68 percent chance of a 10
bps ECB rate hike in September 2019. Expectations for September
2019 had briefly dipped to 60 percent. <ECBWATCH>
    Analysts will want to hear ECB President Mario Draghi's
thoughts on core inflation in the euro zone after referring to a
""vigorous"" pick-up in core inflation at the September meeting. 
    The five-year five-year forward, a long-term gauge of
inflation expectations in the euro zone, is at its lowest point
since May 29, standing at 1.67 percent and inching away from the
ECB's target of close to but below 2 percent <EUIL5YF5Y=R>. 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, hovered around 0.388 percent, a six-week low and
down for the third straight day. <DE10IT10=RR>. 
    Ten-year French and Dutch bond yields were flat to two basis
points lower in early trade. <FR10YT=RR> <AT10YT=RR>. 
    Italian bond yields also fell six to seven bps across the
curve, after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated that
Rome did not want to exit the euro, although he said Italy's
2019 budget deficit target of 2.4 percent should not be trimmed.
<IT10YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR> <IT2YT=RR>.
     The Italy/Germany bond yield spread touched a one-week high
of 323 bps, its second widest since 2013, but later eased to
narrowed to 318 bps <DE10IT10=RR>.

    RIYADH, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will offer
international investors the chance to invest in a raft of
privatisation deals from grains to healthcare and water
desalination over the next six months, Economy Minister Mohammed
al-Tuwaijri said on Thursday.    
    ""From now until the first quarter of 2019 we have four
opportunities in silos and grains,"" Tuwaijri said, adding that
deals in the education, healthcare and water desalinisation
sectors would also be offered in this period.
    He did not give details of the deals, but said the
government had received many expressions of interest from Asian
and European companies. 
    Saudi officials include public-private partnerships to build
and operate infrastructure as well as asset sales in their
definition of privatisation.
    In an interview with Reuters last year, Tuwaijri estimated
the privatisation programme could raise about $200 billion in
coming years, in addition to $100 billion which authorities
aimed to raise by selling a stake in oil giant Saudi Aramco.
    Asked whether the $200 billion figure was still feasible,
Tuwaijri said it depended on what assets the government
selected, and that he was talking with various state bodies to
see which assets they could monetise.
    ""The figures could vary, but also the market ultimately will
decide,"" he said.
    Earlier this year, authorities shelved plans to conduct an
initial public offer of Aramco shares but said the IPO would
happen by early 2021. Tuwaijri repeated on Thursday that the

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The pound rose above $1.29 on
Thursday after a show of support for British Prime Minister
Theresa May from her Conservative Party dampened fears of an
immediate leadership challenge over her Brexit strategy.  
    The prospect of politics scuppering a divorce deal between
Britain and the European Union has weakened sterling in recent
days and on Wednesday the currency sank to a seven-week low
versus the dollar. [nL8N1X44ME]
    However, the lack of voices openly defying May as she
addressed Conservative lawmakers on Wednesday evening staved off
speculation that she could soon be toppled. 
    At 0815 GMT sterling traded up 0.2 percent at $1.29 <GBP=D3>
and flat against the euro at 88.36 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    Still, investors said that with just over five months until
Britain exits the EU the chances of a no-deal Brexit were
mounting and with it the prospect of further sterling losses. 
    ""Domestic politics have flared up again and the cumbersome
dynamics will make it challenging for May to get an eventual
deal through the UK Parliament,"" said Alexandra Dumitru, an
economist at Rabobank. 
    ""We still regard a last-minute deal as the most likely
outcome but due to recent events we now estimate the chances of
a ‘hard Brexit’ as almost as high as the base case.""
    Disagreement over a fallback plan for the border between the
British province of Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland
is the major sticking point in the Brexit talks.
    ""If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in
the short term because her replacement could increase the
chances of a no-deal Brexit,"" said David Cheetham, chief market
analyst at broker XTB.
    But the pound ""remains more sensitive to good news than bad
which may mean a fairly sharp move higher should a [Brexit]
agreement be reached.""
    Sterling briefly gained half a percent against the dollar
and euro on Tuesday after a media report that the EU could offer
May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal.

inflation and economic growth forecasts may provide an argument
for a small interest rate hike in the first quarter of 2019,
rate-setter Eugeniusz Gatnar said in an interview scheduled for
publication on Thursday.
    The central bank maintained its main interest rate at a
historically low 1.5 percent since March 2015. The central bank
governor has said repeatedly that he saw no reason to change
rates until at least the end of 2019.
    ""I think that the November projection may give the Monetary
Policy Council (MPC) arguments to change its rhetoric and lay a
path for possible monetary policy tightening,"" Gatnar said.
    He reiterated his view that he saw a need for one or two
interest rate hikes of 25 basis points each, as expected higher
energy prices will push up consumer prices. The bank targets an
inflation rate of 2.5 percent plus/minus a percentage point.
    In its forecast in July, the central bank said inflation
will stand at 1.8 percent for 2018, accelerating to 2.7 percent
next year.
    ""In my opinion the ... rise of oil, gas and coal prices will
cause acceleration of the inflationary pressure in Poland,""
Gatnar said.
    ""If the energy prices rise strongly, causing inflationary
pressure, we should consider a 25 basis-point rate hike in the
first quarter of 2019, anticipating second-round effects that
could be severe for households,"" he said.
    Inflation in September amounted to 1.9 percent year-on-year
in the biggest post-communist European Union country.
    ""It is worth noticing that MPC members' recent comments
point to the fact that they are aware that an MPC reaction in
2019 may be needed,"" Gatnar said.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields held near
recent lows before a European Central Bank meeting where
policymakers will address a market that has scaled back
inflation bets and rate-hike expectations after poor economic
data. 
    While the ECB is expected to keep policy unchanged, it meets
at a time when markets are blighted by doubts about economic
growth, a spat between Rome and Brussels over Italy's budget and
big declines on Wall Street. 
    However, analysts expect the ECB to acknowledge a worsening
growth outlook even if they do not expect the global concerns to
derail its planned retreat from monetary stimulus. [nL8N1X44VJ]
    ""Draghi has to offer something a bit more dovish in light of
the risk-off environment; at the same time, he has to strike a
balance as the ECB surely still wants to exit these
extraordinary measures by the end of the year,"" said ING rates
strategist Benjamin Schroeder.
    Equity worries on Wednesday drove U.S. Treasury yields to
their lowest since early October, pushing down yields of ""safer
bonds"" though risk sentiment was seen improving, which boosted 
support for higher-yielding euro zone bonds, before Thursday's 
ECB meeting. 
    The ECB is likely to be concerned by this week's purchasing
managers' data, which that showed growth in the euro zone lost
more momentum than expected, pointing to the slowest quarterly
growth in more than two years. [nL9N1T2014]    
    The ECB is scheduled to end its asset-purchase programme
this year, though there is little detail on its planned
reinvestment strategy.
   ""On the QE reinvestment strategy for 2019, the first hints
that it was at least discussed should be expected – full clarity
will likely come in December,"" ING analysts wrote in a note to
clients on Thursday. 
    European money markets, meanwhile, have pushed back
expectations of a rate increase and no longer fully price in an
rise until October 2019. Until last week, they priced in a hike
for next September. <ECBWATCH>     
    Money markets now suggest around a 68 percent chance of a 10
bps ECB rate hike in September 2019. Expectations for September
2019 had briefly dipped to 60 percent. <ECBWATCH>
    Analysts will want to hear ECB President Mario Draghi's
thoughts on core inflation in the euro zone after referring to a
""vigorous"" pick-up in core inflation at the September meeting. 
    The five-year five-year forward, a gauge of long-term
inflation expectations in the euro zone, is at its lowest point
since May 29, standing at 1.67 percent and inching away from the
ECB's target of close to but below 2 percent <EUIL5YF5Y=R>. 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, reached 0.403 percent, having hit a six-week low of
0.388 percent earlier in the session <DE10IT10=RR>. 
    Ten-year French and Dutch bond yields were flat to one basis
point higher. <FR10YT=RR> <AT10YT=RR>. 
    Italian bond yields, on the other hand, fell up to 12 bps
across the curve with Italian banking stocks recovering as part
of a broader European stock market recovery. <IT10YT=RR>
<IT5YT=RR> <IT2YT=RR>.
    Italy's banks index <.FTIT8300> was up 2.4 percent and was
set for its best day in six weeks. 
    Spanish and Portuguese bond yields were also down as much as
five bps. Spanish 10-year bonds yields fell to two-and-a-half-
week lows at 1.591 percent <ES10YT=RR>.
     The Italy/Germany bond yield spread touched a one-week high
of 323 bps, its second widest since 2013, but later narrowed to
narrowed to 310.3 bps <DE10IT10=RR>.

  At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.
  The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
  Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of €15 billion until the end of December 2018.
  The Governing Council anticipates that, subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases will then end.
  The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
  The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course
to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates
sometime after next summer.
    With inflation rebounding and growth on a five-year run, the
ECB has been removing stimulus for much of this year, even if
more recent growth indicators appear to show that the expansion
is running out of steam and risks to the outlook are mounting. 
    But with the bank having already exhausted much of its
firepower the threshold for any extension of its stimulus is
high, requiring a major shock rather than the gradual slowdown
that has characterized this year.
    The bank also made no change to its policy guidance, first
formulated in June and kept broadly unchanged through several
meetings. 
    ""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to
remain at their present levels at least through the summer of
2019, and in any case for as long as necessary,"" it said,
repeating its guidance.
    Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT
news conference, at which he is likely to discuss the broader
economic outlook and will be questioned about Italy's budget
fight with the European Commission.
    Investors will also look to see if Draghi maintains the
ECB's long-standing stance that growth risks are broadly
balanced or takes a more dovish view given a string of
disappointing data. 
    With Thursday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight
deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool,
remains at -0.40 percent.
    The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of
credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00 percent while
the rate on the marginal lending facility -- the emergency
overnight borrowing rate for banks -- remains at 0.25 percent.

    By Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Belgium said on Thursday it had
chosen Lockheed Martin's <LMT.N> F-35 stealth jets over the
Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its ageing F-16s, in a
widely-anticipated decision, saying the pick came down to price.
    After months of deliberation, the decision was announced at
a government news conference and makes Belgium the latest
European country to take up the U.S.-made war plane, alongside
NATO allies including the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey.
    ""We have landed! This government is investing heavily in
defence. With the purchase of F-35A fighter planes ... we ensure
your safety and that of our military,"" Belgian Defence Minister
Steven Vandeput said on Twitter during the news conference.
    ""The offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven
evaluation criteria,"" he later told reporters. 
    The decision is a setback for Britain, Germany, Italy and
Spain, who are behind the Eurofighter programme, and also means
the rejection of an informal French offer to sell Belgium the
Rafale fighter built by Dassault Aviation.
    Prime Minister Charles Michel's government said despite a
strong desire to support European allies, the F-35 was cheaper
for Belgium over the long term, coming in 600 million euros
($684.54 million) under what the government budgeted for.

failed to act on nine out 10 of FATF guidelines, from 'had acted
on only nine of 10')
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The international group that
monitors money-laundering worldwide said on Friday Iran had
until February to complete reforms that would bring it into line
with global norms or face consequences.
    The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force said after a
meeting of its members that it was disappointed that Tehran had
failed to act on nine out of 10 of its guidelines despite
pledges to make the grade. It had previously set a deadline of
October to compete all 10 reforms.
    ""We expect Iran to move swiftly to implement the commitments
that it undertook at a high level so long ago,"" said Marshall
Billingslea, the U.S. assistant Treasury Secretary for terrorist
financing, after chairing an FATF meeting.
    ""In line with that, we expect that it will have adopted all
of these measures by February. If by February 2019 Iran has not
yet done so, then we will take further steps,"" he said. 
    In the meantime, the FATF said it had decided to continue
suspending counter-measures, which can go as far as limiting or
even banning transactions with a country.
    Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said he
welcomed the decision to extend the deadline to February, the
state news agency IRNA reported.
    He also criticised the U.S. chairmanship of FATF, saying it
was an attempt to bring Iran back on to the international
money-laundering blacklist, without elaborating.
    Iran's parliament approved some new measures against funding
terrorism earlier this month under pressure to adopt
international standards. But FATF said that it could only
consider fully enacted legislation.
    Members of FATF had already given Tehran until this month to
bring its laws against money-laundering and funding of terrorism
up to its guidelines.
    Otherwise, Iran risked being returned to a blacklist of
non-compliant countries that makes foreign investors and banks
reluctant to deal with it.
    Britain, France and Germany are trying to keep some
financial channels open to Iran after the United States pulled
out of a 2015 nuclear deal in May and re-imposed sanctions.
    Analysts say that inclusion on the FATF's blacklist could
effectively make that all but impossible.

maintained on Thursday its long-standing view that risks to the
economy are broadly balanced, playing down a long list of signs
that growth may have failed to stabilise and continues to slow. 
    ""The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can
still be assessed as broadly balanced,"" ECB President Mario
Draghi told a news conference. ""At the same time, risks related
to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and
financial market volatility remain prominent.""
    With a global trade war looming, the risk of a hard Brexit
increasing and industrial production taking a hit over the
summer quarter, the euro zone economy has underperformed
expectations, raising the risk that the ECB will struggle to
wean the bloc off stimulus.
   The ECB had debated last month whether to downgrade its risk
assessment, suggesting that policymakers are increasingly
concerned that the slowdown is not due to one-off factors as
previously thought. 
    The problem with downgrading the assessment is that
investors could then anticipate a policy response that the ECB
is not prepared for, especially since inflation, the ECB's
mandate, remains on the path seen earlier.
    With much of the bank's firepower exhausted, policymakers
argue that the bar on extending bond purchases is high and any
discussion about interest rates is premature since the ECB has
guided markets for no change ""through"" next summer, an unusually
long horizon for a policy guidance.

    By Ed Cropley and Aimee Donnellan
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Anheuser-Busch
InBev <ABI.BR> could suffer a decade-long hangover from buying
rival SABMiller. Shares in the world’s biggest brewer fell
nearly 8 percent on Thursday after it halved its dividend to
start tackling a debt mountain piled up partly as a result of
the 2016 transaction. Hitting its target will take a long time.
    The Budweiser-maker reported $13.3 billion of revenue and
$5.36 billion of EBITDA in the three months to September, below
analysts’ expectations. A recession in South Africa and
political instability in Latin America quashed customers’ thirst
while a decline in the United States hardened the case for
addressing high interest costs. AB InBev’s shares had fallen a
third since the SABMiller deal and were trading on a 5 percent
dividend yield before its results, versus rival Heineken’s
<HEIN.AS> 1.9 percent. Both were warnings that something had to
give.
    By halving its dividend, AB InBev is freeing up $4.1 billion
a year to throw at its debt pile. Assuming it does this every
year from now, and that EBITDA grows at 7 percent a year, as
analysts predict, net debt will come down to double EBITDA by
2026, the firm’s preferred level. Heineken’s net debt is 2.3
times its forecast 2018 EBITDA earnings.
    The big if is whether earnings can keep bubbling away at
such a rate. Weak economic growth hampered by a strengthening
U.S. dollar means boozers in AB InBev’s emerging markets have
less spare cash for premium brands such as Corona or the
“reassuringly expensive” Stella Artois. Meanwhile, Heineken is
muscling in on Latin America and even South Africa, SABMiller’s
birthplace. A tumbling currency in hyperinflationary Argentina
also gives a glimpse of what might be in store as the U.S.
Federal Reserve tightens rates further.
    When AB InBev reaches a debt threshold of, say, three times
EBITDA, there might be scope to share the spoils with investors
via an increased dividend. But If EBITDA growth slows to, say, 5
percent, the firm’s “mission accomplished” for reducing debt
will be pushed out one more year. That’s a heavy price to pay
for a big buyout party.

 (Releads with Draghi quotes from news conference, euro moves)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    Acknowledging a weaker recent momentum in the euro zone
economy, ECB chief Mario Draghi reeled off what he called a
""bunch of uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism,
emerging markets and financial market volatility.
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he told an ECB news conference to
justify its policymakers' decision to maintain their judgment
that risks remained ""broadly balanced"".
    The euro ticked higher to $1.1433 as he spoke, additionally
helped by his comment that recent wage increases in the region
-- a key factor in bringing inflation back to levels seen as
normal -- did not look like a one-off phenomenon.
    ""The underlying strength of the economy continues to support
our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to
our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual
winding down of our net asset purchases,"" he said.    
    Earlier the Governing Council statement reaffirmed its
expectation that key ECB interest rates would remain at their
present levels at least ""through the summer of 2019"". Draghi
completed the picture by adding there had been no discussion of
extending stimulus. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels over the
debt-laden country's expansionary budget.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.
    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added.

    By Aditya Kalra
    NEW DELHI, Oct 25 (Reuters) - An Indian anti-trust probe
into beer price-fixing allegations was initiated after the
world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev told the authorities
last year it had detected an industry cartel, three people
familiar with the matter told Reuters.
    AB InBev <ABI.BR> discovered the Indian operations it
acquired as part of its around $100 billion acquisition of
London-listed rival SABMiller Plc in 2016 had for years fixed
beer prices along with Denmark's Carlsberg <CARLb.CO> and
India's United Breweries <UBBW.NS>, which is part-owned by
Heineken NV <HEIN.AS>, the sources said.
    AB InBev conducted an internal investigation in the first
half of last year, after closing the SABMiller deal, and found
that executives had discussed and agreed on their submission of
ex-brewery beer production prices to Indian state governments.
Those ex-brewery prices would include all the production and
marketing costs, as well as a proposed profit margin, and were
used by state governments to set a maximum retail price.
    ""It was startling,"" one of the sources said. ""Extensive
pricing information about the competition, some of which is
extremely confidential, was available to all the three
companies.""
    Earlier this month the Competition Commission of India (CCI)
raided the offices of all the three brewers and found e-mails
that showed executives were allegedly violating Indian
anti-trust laws, Reuters has previously reported. [nL4N1WS290]
    According to the three sources, those raids came after AB
InBev approached the anti-trust watchdog to make disclosures
under a so-called ""leniency programme"" that provides a
whistleblower-type protection for cartel members disclosing
wrongdoing.
    Sudhir Mittal, chairman of the CCI, did not respond to a
request for comment.
    A spokesman for AB InBev, whose Indian offerings include
Budweiser and Corona, said ""it would not be appropriate for us
to comment"" for this article. Carlsberg, which sells beer under
its own-name brand and also owns Tuborg, said it was ""committed
to complying"" with all relevant laws.
    United Breweries, which commands a 51 percent share of the
Indian market and sells the Kingfisher and Heineken beer brands
in India, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Heineken
declined to comment.
    Calls to Shalabh Seth, the managing director of SABMiller in
India at the time of the AB InBev acquisition, went unanswered.
He now works for United Breweries.
    After Reuters reported the CCI raids on Oct. 11, United
Breweries told the Indian stock exchanges the company took its
compliance obligations seriously and was reviewing its legal
risks and potential implications.
    Belgium-based AB InBev has said it takes anti-trust
compliance ""very seriously"".
    The three brewers, who according to Euromonitor
International account for 90 percent of beer consumption in the
$7 billion India market, together face a potential fine of up to
$272 million if they are found to have operated a cartel, the
sources said. Any company executives found to have fixed prices
could also be fined.
    AB InBev could escape some or all of its share of the fines
for self-reporting the issue.
    It was unclear how much the alleged price-fixing may have
cost consumers.
    
    HIGHLY-REGULATED MARKET
    The investigation will cast a further shadow on an Indian
beer business that already faces stringent compliance and
state-level regulation, making it tougher for brewers to expand.
    Though a young and affluent population, better social
acceptance towards drinking and a growing pub culture have
spurred beer consumption, many Indian drinkers still prefer
potent spirits, particularly whisky, especially in smaller towns
and villages.
    Most states individually regulate alcohol pricing and the
companies need to submit and get prices approved every year by
the local authorities. There are also separate labelling,
licensing and brand registration norms.
    The ex-brewery prices set by the companies are also the base
on which alcohol taxes, a vital source of state government
revenue, are imposed.
    That results in wild variations in retail prices. A 330 ml
bottle of Kingfisher costs 36 rupees (49 cents) in the tourist
state of Goa, but 130 rupees ($1.77) in the northern state of
Haryana, a major industrial hub, according to India's largest
beer chain, the Beer Cafe.
        
    RARE DAWN RAIDS
    As part of its investigation, the CCI secured permission
from a Delhi district judge to conduct search and seizure
operations at the brewers' offices, only the third such raids in
the watchdog's near 10-year history.
    The dawn raids were conducted in two Indian cities -
Bengaluru, previously known as Bangalore, in southern India and
Gurugram, near the capital New Delhi - by dozens of officers and
technology experts, five sources with knowledge of the probe
said.
    Over two days, senior company officials were questioned
about pricing, their computer hard-disks copied and mobile
phones cloned to analyse communications over WhatsApp.
    One source gave an example of an e-mail that showed the
companies were exchanging notes on their successes on achieving
better prices in a particular state, and how that model can be
replicated. The source described the communication as a ""brazen""
anti-trust violation.
    Reuters has not been able to independently verify the
contents of any e-mails.
    The watchdog suspects price-fixing in at least four Indian
states, one of the sources said. The CCI's investigation unit
will further question company executives and analyse the seized
evidence before making penalty recommendations in a report,
which will be reviewed by commission members in a process that
could take up to 12 months.
    The Indian probe is the latest anti-trust headache for
global brewers. Last year, the European Commission accused AB
InBev of abusing its market dominance in Belgium by impeding the
flow of cheaper imports into the country. In 2014, a German
regulator fined Carlsberg and smaller brewers for colluding on
prices.    
    
    ""BAFFLING"" MARKET
    The brewers are already facing an uphill struggle in India.
    An executive who has formerly worked for a foreign brewer in
India said local governments were reluctant to allow price
increases, fearing they would impact consumer purchases and, in
turn, their tax revenues.
    ""There is nobody making margins here other than the
governments, they want to maximize their revenue,"" the executive
said.
    Beyond pricing issues, sudden policy changes can also hit
brewers. In 2016, India's Supreme Court banned liquor sales
within 500 meters of highways and the same year the eastern
state of Bihar banned alcohol.
    Three other Indian states and one federally-controlled
island territory also ban or restrict alcohol sales.
    For Carlsberg, the Bihar state ban came just two years after
the company opened a new brewery there. At the time, its then
country head, Michael Jensen, said India was the ""most difficult
market in the world but you can't do stuff like that ... It is
very detrimental for investor confidence"".
    Top brewers also face a challenge from the growing
popularity of premium segment craft beers. Sequoia
Capital-backed B9 Beverages' ""Bira 91"" brand and a start-up
brand ""Simba"" have lured drinkers with quirky branding and
lighter brews.
    Simba clocked sales of $10.2 million last year and is
targeting a doubling this year, but could have grown at a faster
pace if not for the stringent and varied state government
regulations, its founder Prabhtej Singh Bhatia told Reuters.
    Bhatia said his working capital requirements have often been
strained by varied state policies - in Goa, for example, he said
registration of a new beer brand costs $328, compared with
$20,500 in Delhi.
    ""The market is very challenging, it's baffling,"" Bhatia
said.

     Altmaier made the comments at a joint news conference with

complicated process and that there was a need for more talks.
    Altmaier said the Turkish government policy to deal with the
currency crisis has been effective.
    Albayrak said he and Altmaier were in discussions about
""many projects"".
    ""Starting with energy, Germany is one of Turkey's important
investment partners. Whether it is industry and most importantly
the subject of transportation and many other sectors, there are
many projects which we are discussing and the private sector is

protocols regarding one or two of these sectors tomorrow,"" he
added.
    Germany is the second biggest foreign investor in Turkey,

    MILAN, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Milan bank is
proving almost immune to a domestic bond market rout and has few
bad loans. Hence it can probably take market share from battered
Italian peers. For those few bank investors who are Italy
enthusiasts, a lowly valuation makes Mediobanca the sanest way
to buy in.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italy’s Mediobanca on Oct. 25 reported a net profit of 245
million euros for the quarter ending in September, higher than a
company-provided consensus of 220 million euros. Net profit was
down 18 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, which
included a capital gain from asset sales.
    - The bank reported a transitional common equity Tier 1
capital ratio (CET1) of 14.2 percent, stable from the end of
June despite rising interest rates in Italian sovereign bonds.
The impact on the ratio from a sharp fall in Italian government
bonds prices in the period was 2 basis points.
    - The bank said its direct exposure to Italian government
bonds was 2.8 billion euros, equal to about 40 percent of its
CET1 ratio.
    - Mediobanca shares have fallen almost 20 percent since a
March 4 general election that brought into power a populist
coalition in Italy. The shares were up 4.5 percent to 7.82 euros
at 1108 GMT on Oct. 25.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - A London court ruled on Thursday
that Ivica Todoric, founder of beleaguered food production and
retail conglomerate Agrokor, should not be allowed to appeal
against his extradition to Croatia to face allegations of fraud
involving tens of millions of euros.
    Todoric is being investigated in Croatia over the crisis at
Agrokor, the largest private company in the Balkans with about
60,000 employees. 
    He denies any wrongdoing and says Croatia has launched a
politically motivated process against him.
    ""Whilst I am very disappointed by today’s ruling, it will
not stop me from exposing rampant corruption at the very top of
the Croatian government and holding those involved accountable,""
Todoric said after the hearing at the High Court.
    ""I will not be intimidated by the politically and
financially motivated attacks against me,"" he added. 
    Agrokor was put under state-run administration more than a
year ago after an overly ambitious expansion drive left it
weighed down by borrowings.
    An audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) showed a net loss
in 2015 of 3.6 billion kuna ($565 million) against a net profit
of 1.2 billion kuna released by the previous management.
    Todoric's extradition was approved by a London court in
April. [nL8N1S01W6]

    By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy would need to secure a
bailout from the European Union if it is to receive any help
from the European Central Bank to bring down its borrowing costs
on financial markets, the ECB's President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday.
    The European Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget
this week, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending,
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face
disciplinary action. [nL8N1X42NA]
    Draghi, himself an Italian, reaffirmed he was ""confident""
that Rome would eventually reach an agreement with the
Commission and end a standoff that has sent investors fleeing
Italian bonds. 
    But, confirming what sources had told Reuters earlier this
month, Draghi added the ECB would come to Italy's rescue if the
country subscribed to an adjustment programme with the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) -- political parlance for a bailout
with strict policy prescriptions. [nL8N1WS11V]
    This would clear the way for the ECB to buy Italian bonds on
the market via so called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) --
a tool announced at the height of the debt crisis in 2012 and
yet unused.
    ""What is available for the ECB towards a specific country is
OMT,"" Draghi told a press conference after a meeting of the
ECB's policy-making Governing Council.
    ""And the OMT is subject to having a programme with ESM and
is also subject to the assessment by the Governing Council that
the undertaking of the OMT doesn't prejudge the monetary policy
for the whole of the euro area,"" he added.
    Italy's bond yields hit a 4-1/2 year high last week as
investors worried that the row between Rome and the Commission
might eventually push the euro zone's third-largest economy
outside the currency bloc.
    Italy's European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona said earlier
this month he was confident that, if necessary, Draghi would
""take care of things"" and ""prevent another grave crisis in
Europe"". [nR1N1RB024]
    But Draghi stressed it wasn't the ECB's job to bankroll
governments.
    ""Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits or adhering to a fiscal
dominance situation,"" he told the news conference. 
    The ECB's goal is keeping inflation in the euro zone close
to, but below 2 percent a year.
    With Draghi seeing ""limited"" spillover to other countries'
bonds from the Italian rout, the ECB confirmed on Thursday its
plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme at the
end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time
since 2011 sometime after next summer. [nL8N1X56JH]
    Draghi warned that the sell-off in Italian government bonds
was set to dent the capital of the country's banks, which own
some 375 billion euros worth of that paper. 
    But the central banker also sought to strike a constructive
tone on the Italian situation. He quoted European Commission
Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, who was also at the ECB
meeting, as saying: ""We have to observe and apply fiscal rules.
But we are also seeking a dialogue.""

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 25: Fitch Ratings has assigned PBD Germany Auto 
2018 UG'ss EUR600 million class A notes (ISIN: XS1886368296) a final 'AAAsf' 
rating. The Outlook is Stable.

PBD Germany Auto 2018 UG is a securitisation of German auto loan receivables 
originated by PSA Bank Deutschland GmbH (PSAD), a joint-venture between Banque 
PSA Finance, the financial arm of the French car maker Peugeot S.A., and 
Santander Consumer Bank AG. The portfolio consists of both amortising and 
balloon loans advanced to individual and commercial borrowers to purchase new or 
used vehicles. A 12-month revolving pool and two cash reserves are financed from 
the proceeds of the notes and a subordinated loan.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Customer Type Drives Asset Performance

Fitch has determined customer type as the key asset performance driver and has 
therefore derived individual default and recovery assumptions for private and 
commercial customers. Taking into account a possible portfolio migration during 
the revolving period, this resulted in a weighted average (WA) base-case default 
rate of 2.4% and recovery rate of 53.4% for the total portfolio.

High Balloon Exposure

Up to 85% of the asset pool at the end of the revolving period could include a 
balloon component at loan maturity. Borrowers may face a payment shock if they 
cannot refinance the balloon amount, for example, due to a default of PSAD, or 
sell the car for the balloon amount in a downturn of the used-car market. We 
have considered this additional default risk by applying a WA default multiple 
of 6.4x for 'AAA' in our analysis.

Controlled Revolving

The risk of significant portfolio deterioration during the 12-month revolving 
period is limited by replenishment criteria and by random selection of new 
assets. We also view the early amortisation events in the documentation as 
reasonably stringent.

Seller-Related Risks Addressed

There is no back-up servicer in place at closing. However, an amortising reserve 
fund and the possibility of using principal collections for interest payments 
protect the transaction from payment interruption risk in case of servicing 
disruption. Commingling risk is immaterial as collections are forwarded to the 
issuer accounts no later than two business days upon receipt thereof.

DUE DILIGENCE 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Expected impact upon the class A notes' rating of increased defaults:

Current rating: 'AAAsf'

Increase base case defaults by 10%: 'AA+sf'

Increase base case defaults by 25%: 'AA+sf'

Increase base case defaults by 50%: 'AA-sf'

Expected impact upon the class A notes' rating of reduced recoveries:

Current rating: 'AAAsf'

Reduce base case recovery by 10%: 'AAAsf'

Reduce base case recovery by 25%: 'AAAsf'

Reduce base case recovery by 50%: 'AA+sf'

Fitch views the sensitivities in the table above asalso providing an indication 
on rating changes upon potential deterioration of used car prices of vehicles 
equipped with diesel engines (see Fitch Ratings: Risks to German Used Diesel Car 
Prices, Demand Persist). The originator quantified the total diesel share in the 
pool at about 53% of the portfolio volume.

Assuming a decrease of 25% in all diesel vehicles' recovery proceeds, while 
leaving recovery proceeds for non-diesel vehicles unchanged, there is no impact 
on the class A notes' rating.

Expected impact upon the class A notes' rating of increased defaults and reduced 
recoveries:

Current rating: 'AAAsf'

Increase default base case by 10%; reduce recovery base case by 10%: 'AA+sf'

Increase default base case by 25%; reduce recovery base case by 25%: 'AAsf'

Increase default base case by 50%; reduce recovery base case by 50%: 'A+sf'

DATA ADEQUACY 

Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset 
portfolio information, and concluded that there were no findings that affected 
the rating analysis.

Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of PSAD's origination files 
and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately 
consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other 
information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION 

The information below was used in the analysis.

    * Cost of mortgages, corporate loans creeping higher
    * Credit squeeze could derail govt plan to spur economy

    By Valentina Za, Andrea Mandala and Giulio Piovaccari
    MILAN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy's banks are charging
households and businesses more to borrow after a fall in the
value of the country's bonds, the first sign of a credit
tightening that could disrupt the populist government's economic
revival plans.
    Investors have been dumping Italian assets since the
formation in June of a coalition government whose draft 2019
budget plan this month prompted Moody's to cut Italy's credit
rating and the European Commission to demand a revision.
    Data reviewed by Reuters shows interest rates on mortgages
and loans are creeping higher, while some firms say banks are
demanding repayment as falling government bond prices eat into
their capital and rising yields lift funding costs. 
    This has rung alarm bells in Rome and beyond, with Italian
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria saying that current bond yields,
which are near a 4-1/2 year high on the benchmark 10-year
maturity, could not be sustained for long because of the threat
to weaker banks. [nS8N1RT020]
    Meanwhile, Italy, as the euro zone's third-largest economy,
is seen as crucial to the wider stability of the currency bloc
because it is widely regarded as too big to be rescued.
    European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday Italian banks' woes were bound to affect lending terms
though the rise in loan rates was still moderate.[nL8N1X55FN] 
    But in the longer-term, higher borrowing costs could dent
support for the populist government, which is riding high in
opinion polls and has included a ""citizens' salary"" for poorer
Italians in the budget as part of its plan to help the economy.
    Meanwhile, the interest rate on some fixed-rate mortgages -
by far the most common type in Italy - increased by as much as
20 basis points in the first 10 days of October, Ivano Cresto,
of price-comparison website Facile.it, said.
    That partly reflects a rise in the benchmark rate for such
mortgages - set at a European level - but also the so-called
spread banks apply on top to offset higher funding costs,
banking sources told Reuters. https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rd61IB
    Italy's top two banks, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and
UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, both said they had raised the cost of
fixed-rate mortgages after the summer by up to 20 basis points.
    ""Intesa and UniCredit have often proved to be first movers
in the mortgage market,"" said Roberto Anedda, head of marketing
at mortgage data website MutuiOnline.it.
    
    RUSH TO BUY
    Worried about further rate rises, some people are rushing to
buy properties even if it means allowing the seller to continue
to live there for a period after the purchase, bank staff said.
    A 20 bp interest rate increase would add up to 2,800 euros
in payments to an average mortgage of around 124,000 euros over
20 years, the most common duration, Reuters calculations based
on MutuiOnline data show.
    Italy's ABI banking association declined to comment,
although a spokesman pointed to its data for September, before
the budget was presented, which showed the average rate on new
home mortgages and corporate loans edging lower.
    Although central bank liquidity has shielded Italian banks
from the full impact of rising rates, the ECB has begun
unwinding its ultra-loose monetary policy.
     ""The (transmission) chain is long,"" a top executive at an
Italian bank said, referring to the mechanism through which
higher funding costs for banks lead to pricier loans and
shrinking capital buffers curtail their lending capacity.
    ""But we're beginning to witness the first signs,"" he added.
    Businesses are also starting to feel the heat and the Bank
of Italy has said companies surveyed in September had signalled
a slight worsening in credit conditions. 
    ""We haven't closed any important credit lines recently, but
the banks say they would charge an extra 80-100 basis points on
10-year loans compared to levels we'd been discussing at the
start of the summer,"" Fabio Pezzani, head of finance at GVM Care
& Research, a healthcare group based near Ravenna, told Reuters.
    Pezzani said the increase on short-term funding was limited
to an extra 10-15 basis points in the spread over the benchmark.
    ""For the time being, I think it's just a matter of a higher
cost of funding ... from next year, I fear we'll also have a
problem of ... tighter credit offer,"" Pezzani said.
    
    SELECTIVE LOANS
    During the euro zone crisis of 2011-2012, when bank
liquidity dried up and Italian government bond yields topped 7
percent, a credit crunch exacerbated a recession that wiped out
a quarter of Italy's industrial output.
    A person in charge of corporate lending at a local bank in
southern Italy, where default rates are higher, said they had
considered raising loan rates charged to firms by 200 basis
points this month.
    The owner of a small fruit and vegetable business from
Italy's southern Apulia region said that he had been forced to
repay an up to 80,000 euro overdraft.         
    ""They said they no longer wanted to support an agricultural
business because it is seasonal,"" he told Reuters.
    ""But I insisted, and said I had always paid regularly, so
eventually they told me markets were bad with bond yields rising
and the outlook for the next few months so unpredictable ...
that they had to take precautions.""
    Corporate lending, which shrank steadily between mid-2012
and mid-2016, has recovered moderately since but banks have
become more selective after they saw nearly a fifth of their
loans turn sour in the last recession.
    ""Banks' concerns over souring loans are one of the main
reasons small firms see their credit curtailed or altogether
revoked,"" said Antonio Pinto, a lawyer with consumer association
Confconsumatori.

 (Adds detail, economists)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
stuck to plans on Thursday to claw back unprecedented stimulus,
even as the growth outlook continues to darken and political
turmoil in Italy looms large over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($3
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    While he acknowledged a loss of growth momentum and a ""bunch
of uncertainties"" from trade protectionism and market
volatility, ECB President Mario Draghi played down concerns,
arguing that the euro zone was merely returning to a normal or
natural pace of expansion after an exceptional 2017.
    ""We're talking about weaker momentum, not a downturn,""
Draghi told a news conference after policymakers decided to
maintain a long-standing assessment that growth risks were
""broadly balanced"". 
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he said, adding that the ECB did
not even contemplate extending its bond purchase programme,
which has depressed borrowing costs and revived growth. 
    The comments appeared to confirm already solid expectations
that the ECB will not go back on its pledge to end bond
purchases by the close of the year, even if the growth outlook
continues to weaken. 
    ""The ECB remains highly determined to bring net asset
purchases to an end,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""It
would require a severe downturn of the economy, not only weaker
momentum, in the coming six weeks for the ECB to alter its
course."" 
    Focusing on inflation, the bank's primary mandate, Draghi
struck a positive tone, arguing that wage growth was a ""very
comforting"" sign and that policymakers remained confident that
price growth will rise.
    But despite the hawkish message -- which included an upbeat
assessment of firmer wage pressures -- the euro slipped on his
comment that Europe's monetary union remained ""fragile"" as long
as measures to shore up existing structures were not complete.
    ""And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean
the capital market union,"" he added of measures initiated as a
result of the sovereign debt crisis of almost a decade ago but
which have foundered on a lack of consensus among member states.
    The single currency slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.138
after having earlier reached a session-high of $1.143.
      
    ITALY
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels. He made it
abundantly clear that the ECB would not come to Italy's aid.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. 
    """"Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits,"" Draghi said. 
    He said rising bond yields were already eating into Italy's
fiscal capacity, suggesting that attempts to raise spending
would be counterproductive as investors will punish Rome for
spending too much.
    With a debt to GDP ratio of 130 percent, Italy is the euro
zone's second most indebted country after Greece, and under its
rejected budget proposal, this debt level is unlikely to fall. 

    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.
    Economists said the message to Rome was clear: that the ECB
will not come to its aid and it should prepare for life after
years of central bank support. 
    ""The ECB is not about to run to Italy's rescue, even if
market conditions deteriorated further,"" Nordea economist Jan
von Gerich said.

    By Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone shares ended a choppy
session well in positive territory on Thursday as positive
corporate results in France and a late boost from a weakening
euro - a boon for exporters - lifted the market.
    Shares had earlier fallen amid a global sell-off, with weak
results from blue chips such as AB InBev or WPP underlining
investor concern about slowing earnings growth.
    The euro zone STOXX <.STOXXE> rose 1 percent with France's
CAC 40 <.FCHI> gaining as much as 1.6 percent, lifted by a batch
of positive corporate results. 
    The region's exporters also got a lift from a falling euro
after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said Europe's
monetary union remained fragile, doing little to assuage
concerns about financial instability in Italy.
    Gains also accelerated with Wall Street delivering a strong
comeback after heavy losses on Wednesday and the tech-heavy
Nasdaq having its worst day since 2011.
    Earnings dominated the day with some heavy losses.
    WPP <WPP.L> shares sank and lost 13.8 percent after the
advertising group cut its outlook, reporting a sharp downturn in
trading. The stock hit its lowest level since December 2012 and
was down 16 percent by 0840 GMT. [nL8N1X51PE]
    WPP dragged the media sector down <.SXMP> 2 percent.
    AB InBev <ABI.BR> shares tumbled 10.4 percent after the
Belgian brewing giant halved its dividend due to volatility in
emerging markets. [nL8N1X50X9]
    ""In every region, both volumes and sales missed
expectations. The bright spots were China, Mexico, Western
Europe and many African markets while Brazil, Argentina and
South Africa faced difficulty,"" wrote Liberum analysts. 
    Stocks that missed expectations were punished harshly. 
    Sweden's Epiroc <EPIRa.ST> fell 5.2 percent after the
Swedish mining machinery maker reported third-quarter orders
well below market expectations. [nL8N1X51BF]
    Autos <.SXAP> rose 3.1 percent with Peugeot <PEUP.PA>
topping the CAC 40, up 7 percent. 
    Top of the STOXX was Kion <KGX.DE>, jumping 13 percent after
the German logistics company reported strong order intake.
[nL8N1X52KM]    
    Finnish heavy machinery firm Konecranes <KCRA.HE> also rose
12.8 percent after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings.
[nL8N1X51XT]
    Dometic <DOMETIC.ST> was among the biggest fallers, down
16.2 percent after the manufacturer of motorhome electrical
parts reported profits in line with expectations.

    Even when it stops adding to its 2.6 trillion euro stash of
bonds, the ECB will remain in the market for a long time to
replace debt that expires.
    This will not be easy as not every issue that matures is
immediately replaced by new supply from the same country --
particularly in Germany, where the government runs a budget
surplus and the ECB bought many short-term bonds.
    For this reason, ECB policymakers want to give themselves
more than the current three months to reinvest the proceeds from
maturing bonds, two sources familiar with the matter said.
    A decision is due at the ECB's Dec. 13 meeting. An ECB
spokesperson declined to comment.

    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels. He made it
abundantly clear that the ECB would not come to Italy's aid.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. [nL8N1X57X2]
    ""Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits,"" Draghi said. 
    He said rising bond yields were already eating into Italy's
fiscal capacity, suggesting that attempts to raise spending
would be counterproductive as investors will punish Rome for
spending too much.
    With a debt to GDP ratio of 130 percent, Italy is the euro
zone's second most indebted country after Greece, and under its
rejected budget proposal, this debt level is unlikely to fall. 
    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.""
    Economists said the message to Rome was clear: that the ECB
will not come to its aid and it should prepare for life after
years of central bank support. 
    ""The ECB is not about to run to Italy's rescue, even if
market conditions deteriorated further,"" Nordea economist Jan
von Gerich said.

    By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy would need to secure a
bailout from the European Union if it is to receive any help
from the European Central Bank to bring down its borrowing costs
on financial markets, the ECB's President Mario Draghi said on
Thursday.
    The European Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget
this week, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending,
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face
disciplinary action in a standoff that has sent investors
fleeing Italian bonds. [nL8N1X42NA]
    Confirming what sources told Reuters earlier this month,
Draghi said the ECB would only come to Italy's rescue if the
country subscribed to an adjustment programme with the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM) -- political parlance for a bailout
with strict policy prescriptions. [nL8N1WS11V]
    This would clear the way for the ECB to buy Italian bonds on
the market via so called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) --
a tool announced at the height of the debt crisis in 2012 and as
yet unused.
    ""What is available for the ECB towards a specific country is
OMT,"" Draghi told a press conference after a meeting of the
ECB's policy-making Governing Council.
    ""And the OMT is subject to having a programme with ESM and
is also subject to the assessment by the Governing Council that
the undertaking of the OMT doesn't prejudge the monetary policy
for the whole of the euro area,"" he added.
    Draghi also warned that the sell-off in Italian government
bonds was set to dent the capital of Italy's banks, which own
about 375 billion euros ($426.30 billion) worth of that paper. 
    Italy's European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona responded to
Draghi later on Thursday, saying it was up to the ECB ""to
intervene should there be a crisis in the banking sector"".
[nR1N1X4008]  
    Italy's bond yields hit a 4-1/2 year high last week as
investors worried that the row between Rome and the Commission
might eventually push the euro zone's third-largest economy
outside the currency bloc.
    Savona had said earlier this month he was confident that, if
necessary, Draghi would ""take care of things"" and ""prevent
another grave crisis in Europe"". [nR1N1RB024]
    But Draghi stressed it wasn't the ECB's job to bankroll
governments.
    ""Our mandate ... is a mandate towards price stability, not
towards financing governments' deficits or adhering to a fiscal
dominance situation,"" he told the news conference. 
    The ECB's goal is keeping inflation in the euro zone close
to, but below two percent a year.
    With Draghi seeing ""limited"" spillover to other countries'
bonds from the Italian rout, the ECB confirmed on Thursday its
plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme at the
end of this year and raise interest rates for the first time
since 2011 sometime after next summer. [nL8N1X56JH]
    But the central banker also sought to strike a constructive
tone on the Italian situation, saying he was ""confident"" that
Rome would eventually reach an agreement with the Commission.
     He also quoted European Commission Vice President Valdis
Dombrovskis, who was also at the ECB meeting, as saying: ""We
have to observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking
a dialogue.""

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Banks in Britain must hold enough
cash to withstand any disorderly Brexit hitting financial
markets next March, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods
said on Thursday.
    Woods said he was making sure that Britain's departure from
the European Union is as smooth as possible for markets, even if
there is no exit deal between London and Brussels.
    ""Just in case things go badly we have been working with
firms to ensure they have in place liquidity sufficient to
accommodate a severe dislocation in financial markets,"" Woods
told an audience of bankers.
    ""We all need to be ready for a range of outcomes."" he said
at the annual City of London dinner in the capital's financial
district.
    Britain is legislating to allow banks and insurers in the EU
to continue serving UK customers after Brexit, even if Britain
crashes out of the bloc with no transition deal.
    ""We encourage all firms to opt into the regime because it
will provide certainty until March 2022, independent of the
existence and duration of any wider implementation period,""
Woods said.
    ""This is a straightforward, common sense way of lowering the
risk of disruption to the City of London,"" said Woods, head of
the BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which
supervises banks.
    The BoE published a welter of papers on Thursday to help the
sector get ready for Brexit.
    Woods urged the EU to mirror these efforts to ensure that
financial contracts such as insurance policies and derivatives
don't face disruption, whatever happens next March.
    Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct
Authority, told the same event that British regulators
""urgently"" need their EU counterparts to begin joint talks on
cross-border memorandums of understanding.
    ""This technical, regulator-to-regulator coordination is
essential to minimise disruption in a no-deal situation,"" Bailey
said.
    The City is worried that the EU is dragging its feet, piling
pressure on banks in Britain to shift staff and operations
before March to countries that will remain in the EU.
    Britain and the EU want a ""standstill"" transition period
from March until the end of 2020 as part of a divorce settlement
that has yet to be agreed.
    
    CLOSELY ALIGNED
    Bailey said there were good reasons for Britain to ""seek to
stay closely aligned to the EU"" in financial regulation -
comments that are likely to dismay pro-Brexit lawmakers who see
exit from the bloc as an opportunity to ease up some rules to
keep London competitive globally.
    Bailey said Britain and the EU could commit to acknowledging
formally that their respective financial rules were ""equivalent""
as early as possible to allow two-way business and remove
potential ""cliff edges"" next March.
    New rules that require Britain's banks to ""ring fence"" their
retail arms with capital cushions come into force next year.
    The aim is to ensure deposits are kept safe whatever happens
to the rest of the bank, and Woods said it was important that
these new units remain independent. ""We are setting up a border
patrol of PRA staff who will police the fence,"" he said.
    Woods also warned he would be asking ""more pointedly and
regularly than before"" whether pay and bonuses of senior bankers
reflect their success or failure in tasks such as avoiding
operational glitches.

    By Paul Wallace
    Oct 25 (Reuters) - The black hole that is Brexit is now
exerting its gravitational pull on the UK budget. Beset by
uncertainties about reaching a deal with the EU, chancellor of
the exchequer Philip Hammond is expected to stall when he
presents his plans to the House of Commons on Oct. 29 – doing as
little as possible. But that will only postpone a looming
confrontation with fiscal reality, which will dash Brexiter
hopes and confound European fears of Britain turning into a
low-tax competitor outside the EU. Instead the British state
will turn more European with higher levels of tax and spending.
    Hammond will be able to present a holding operation on
Monday thanks to continuing progress in bringing down borrowing.
The budget deficit in the financial year that ended in March was
less than 2 percent of GDP, far below the 10 percent peak
reached in 2009-10 and the lowest since the early 2000s.
Borrowing also looks set to come in lower than expected in the
current financial year. 
    However, the achievement is overstated because the deficit
excludes public borrowing to finance student loans, much of
which will not be repaid. It is also partial because net public
debt has soared since the financial crisis, from 35 percent of
GDP in 2007-08 to 85 percent in the last financial year. Even
though low interest rates make this bearable, the high debt
burden weighs on the chancellor, limiting his capacity to borrow
more. 
    But the real problem for Hammond is that his success in
lowering the deficit is a victory in a forgotten war. The new
political and budgetary battleground is the increasingly
critical condition of Britain’s public services following an
almost decade-long funding squeeze. Staff reductions following
cuts in the prison budget have, for example, taken their toll.
Assaults within jails, both on fellow prisoners and on officers,
have soared. A further casualty of the cuts has been funding for
adult social care. The NHS itself is chronically overstretched.
    The lower budget deficit flatters to deceive because it
takes no account of pent-up pressures for higher spending to
meet demand for better public services, above all in the NHS.
Britain has been here before. The Treasury has a bad habit of
overdoing spending squeezes to the point where they work only in
spreadsheets rather than the experience of the public. The last
crackdown on expenditure after a surge in borrowing in the early
1990s went too far, eventually prompting a prolonged rebound in
spending under Labour after it won power in 1997. 
    When governments change tack it is the prime minister rather
than the chancellor who leads the way. Tony Blair lit the touch
paper for Labour’s public spending boom at the start of 2000
when he responded to anxiety about the NHS by pledging to bring
health spending up to the EU average. Tellingly, Theresa May
ripped up the government’s spending plans this summer to
announce a big birthday present for the health service – a
five-year funding boost – on its seventieth anniversary. She was
at it again at the Conservative Party conference in early
October, claiming that austerity was over. 
    But May and Hammond cannot simply follow where Blair and his
chancellor Gordon Brown led two decades ago, because the
auspices for the public finances are so much less favorable now.
Labour could preside over a sustained expansion in public
spending because the economy flourished in the decade leading up
to the financial crisis, buoyed by high productivity growth and
an expanding workforce swelled by migration. Hammond cannot bank
on a similar benign outturn. Even if productivity growth
recovers after grinding to a virtual standstill in the past
decade, population ageing will curb any contribution to GDP
growth from higher employment.
    Brexit rubs salt in the wound. By stopping the free movement
of people from the EU it limits the scope for migration to
offset the demographic brake. And by harming Britain’s main
trading relationship it inflicts further economic costs. Already
GDP is 2.5 percent smaller than if Britain had voted to remain
in the 2016 referendum, according to the Centre for European
Reform. 
    Since GDP is the tax base, Britain’s mediocre growth
prospects spell trouble for the Treasury. Turning a headache
into a migraine, population ageing will necessitate much higher
public spending. As the big baby-boom cohort born after World
War Two retires, taxpayers must pay for the swelling number of
old people receiving state pension benefits (the equivalent of
America’s Social Security) and needing extra health care. The
Office for Budget Responsibility, a fiscal watchdog, anticipates
an increase in age-related spending of almost 4 percent of GDP
over the next two decades.
    Britain will have to confront a hard choice it has been able
to duck in the past. It will no longer be possible to combine
European public services and welfare with American taxes. The
perennially exigent NHS will undoubtedly need more birthday
presents while other public services desperately require extra
funding. Given the underlying demand for higher spending and the
limit on more borrowing, taxes will have to rise substantially.
That is what the public wants, with a long-running opinion
survey showing that 60 percent back the government spending and
taxing more, double the share in 2010 and the highest for
fifteen years. 
    On IMF figures, Britain currently raises 36.1 percent of GDP
in revenues, higher than America’s 31.7 percent but lower than
Germany’s 44.5 percent. An increase in taxation of at least 1
percent of GDP over the next few years is a bare minimum and one
of 2 percent is more likely. Whatever the scale of the increase
it would move Britain closer towards the European model.
    Hammond will postpone making that historic choice in his
budget, but arguably May has already made it through her pledge
to the NHS. The fiscal reckoning will be unpalatable for
Brexiters yearning to resurrect the Thatcherite dream of a
smaller state. Instead, Brexit will intensify already powerful
pressures in the opposite direction. The inconvenient truth is
that as Britain leaves the EU, taxation will have to rise,
shifting the British state closer towards the high-tax European

    By Sinéad Carew
    NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed back on
Thursday after a massive sell-off the day previous, with strong
earnings encouraging investors to venture into risky bets again,
while the dollar gained on the euro.
    Oil prices were bolstered by the rebound in equities markets
and as Saudi Arabia's energy minister signaled major producers
may need to intervene in crude markets to support prices.
[nL3N1X52LS]
    The euro fell to a two month low after European Central Bank
chief Mario Draghi reaffirmed that the bank's 2.6-trillion euro
($2.97 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and
interest rates could rise after next summer, even though the
economic outlook has darkened and political turmoil looms in
Italy. [nL2N1X51YE]
    While equity investors were reassured by positive earnings
from Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> and strong advertising revenues
from Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> they also voiced some caution about
whether the broader pullback was over. [nL2N1X4209] [nL3N1X54F1]
    ""You can't look at it blindly and say earnings are turning
the market around and we're all clear. A lot of people are
skeptical of any kind of action in the market right now,
especially to the upside. That's why volume is light today,""
said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior
portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
    Even the most optimistic investors were cautious.
    ""Quarterly reports are providing better-than-expected
earnings, revenue and guidance. That triple play is instilling
confidence in investors,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny's
Commentary LLC.
    But, he added, ""We need other drivers to provide stability
to the market after this meaningful sell-off we've seen in the
last five weeks.""
    Investors are looking for further strong results for the
remaining two thirds of S&P 500 companies that are yet to
report, as well as a resumption of share buybacks by companies
that have already reported. 
    They are also awaiting third-quarter U.S. GDP data that is
due out on Friday. If the reading is lower than expectations
investors will worry about economic growth but if it is much
higher they will fear a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes,
Kenny said.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 401.13 points,
or 1.63 percent, to 24,984.55, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 49.47
points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,705.57 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 209.94 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,318.34. [.N]
    In the previous day's session the indexes had plunged,
confirming a correction for the Nasdaq as disappointing
forecasts from chipmakers and weak home sales data had fueled
jitters about economic and profit growth.[nL2N1X42CM]
    During its trading day, the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX>
had darted in and out of positive territory before closing up
0.51 percent, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe
<.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.75 percent. [nL8N1X52V8]
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.17 percent, with the euro
<EUR=> down 0.17 percent to $1.1372.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Italy's budget plans, but
the euro had reversed earlier gains after he said the monetary
union remained fragile. [nL8N1X57HB]
    Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc <CHF=> and
Japanese yen <JPY=> safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds
held their ground. [nL8N1X53ZM]
    The Japanese yen weakened 0.15 percent versus the greenback
at 112.43 per dollar, while Sterling <GBP=> was last trading at
$1.2816, down 0.50 percent on the day.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 1.24 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> lost 3.72 percent. [nL3N1X52Q4]
    U.S. Treasury yields rose from three-week lows as equities
gained, though anxiety about ongoing stock volatility continued
to give some support to safe-haven U.S. government debt prices.
    Benchmark 10-year Treasuries <US10YT=RR> last fell 1/32 in
price to yield 3.1262 percent, from 3.124 percent late on
Wednesday.  [nL2N1X51O4]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> rose 0.25 percent to $66.99 per barrel
and Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $76.63, up 0.6 percent on the
day. [nL3N1X52LS]
    Spot gold <XAU=> dropped 0.1 percent to $1,231.82 an ounce
due to the strong dollar and the equities rebound. [nL3N1X55UN]

    By David Ljunggren and David Lawder
    OTTAWA, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Top trade officials from 12
countries and the European Union on Thursday declared their
strong support for reforming World Trade Organization rules in
the face of U.S. actions that are effectively threatening to
paralyze the body.
    The officials, meeting in the Canadian capital Ottawa for a
day, said they shared a ""common resolve for rapid and concerted
action"" to address challenges to the WTO.
    ""The current situation at the WTO is no longer sustainable.
Our resolve for change must be matched with action,"" said the
final communique.
    The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is
blocking appointments of WTO judges and has threatened to pull
out of the grouping designed to ensure a rules-bound global
trade system. [nL8N1WI1SE]
    ""We are deeply concerned by recent developments in
international trade, particularly the rise in protectionism,
which negatively affect the WTO and put the entire multilateral
trading system at risk,"" said the communique.
    As well as Canada, the one-day conference grouped the
European Union, Mexico, Japan, Brazil, Australia and seven other
countries. Participants agreed to meet again in January 2019 to
review progress.
    Absent from the meeting were the United States and China,
whose escalating tariff war has thrown the future of the
23-year-old trade body into doubt.
    The communique said participants recognized the need for
changes to the WTO's dispute settlement system - which the
United States is particularly unhappy about - but said they were
""deeply concerned"" that judicial vacancies presented a risk to
the WTO system as a whole.
    The statement did not refer directly to the United States'
actions to block such appointments.
    ""We acknowledge that concerns have been raised about the
functioning of the dispute settlement system and are ready to
work on solutions,"" the statement said.
    The officials also said they recognize ""the need to address
market distortions caused by subsidies and other instruments,"" a
reference to complaints by the United States and some other
Western economies that current WTO anti-subsidy rules fail to
capture all of the ways China's government supports its
industries and state enterprises.
    The statement said the officials were concerned with WTO
members' track record in complying with subsidy notification
requirements and called for stronger monitoring and transparency
of countries' trade policies.
    Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said he wanted
the meeting to demonstrate enough progress to make clear that
many countries were determined to maintain a rules-based system.
 
    ""I would hope that type of momentum is then seen by, for
example, the U.S., as a positive demonstration that other
nations hear their concerns about the way the WTO hasn't been
working,"" he told reporters.

871,5672,9b880f4eca66c76b019a77063f15d177,Austria calls for EU-wide halt in arms sales to Saudi Arabia,2018-10-26 6:00:03,EUR,0.0,2018-10-26 6:01:18,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The European Union should halt
arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the killing of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl told a
German newspaper, saying such action could also help end ""the
terrible war in Yemen"".
    The comments from Austria, current president of the EU, came
 after Germany said it would stop approving weapons exports to
Saudi Arabia until Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul is cleared up. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is
also discussing how to deal with sales that have already been
approved.
    Referring to the wider EU, Kneissl told Die Welt newspaper: 
   ""The halt in arms deliveries proposed by Chancellor Merkel
would be a correct signal."" Austria had already stopped sending
military equipment to Saudi Arabia in March 2015, she added.
    France and Britain - which will leave the EU in March - are 
major arms suppliers to Riyadh.
    President Emmanuel Macron told King Salman on Wednesday that
France, in coordination with partners, could take action against
those held responsible for the murder. [nL8N1X444Y] 
    However, since coming to power last year Macron has largely
ignored protests over arms sales he deems vital to jobs and
France's strategic relationships in the region. French arms
deals with Riyadh totalled 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last
year.
    The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Thursday 
calling on member states to impose an EU-wide arms embargo on
Saudi Arabia.
    Merkel spoke to the king on Thursday, condemning the killing
and saying Germany was ready to take ""appropriate measures""
along with international partners, her chancellery said.
[nS8N1T903U] 
    Kneissl said the war in Yemen and a crisis in relations
between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies should prompt
joint EU action. ""If we as the entire EU stop weapons deliveries
to Saudi Arabia, that could help end these conflicts,"" she told
the newspaper.
    A Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen's war in 2015
has conducted frequent air strikes targeting the Iran-aligned
Houthi group and has often hit civilians, although it denies
doing so intentionally.     
    The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more
than 2 million and driven Yemen to the verge of widespread
famine.  
    Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said on Thursday that
Khashoggi's murder earlier this month was premeditated,
reversing previous official statements that the killing was
unintended. [nL8N1X53HE]
    Kneissl described the case as ""profoundly shocking"" and an
unprecedented violation of law, but said it marked the
culmination of two years of ""massive deterioration in the human
rights situation in Saudi Arabia"".
    The Austrian foreign ministry confirmed the remarks were
accurate, but had no further comment. ($1 = 0.8797 euros)

872,5673,61138452cf282dd3b4339f8059782aa8,UK's Hammond to warn of Brexit hit to spending hopes - NIESR,2018-10-26 7:01:01,EUR,-0.64876,2018-10-26 7:01:11,"{'EUR': 'Neutral', 'GBP': 'Positive'}","    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip
Hammond is likely to warn that a no-deal Brexit would hit the
public finances and prevent an end to austerity when he delivers
his annual budget next week, a think-tank said.
    By contrast, a smooth transition from the European Union
would give Hammond more room for borrowing and spending, the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research said.
    Hammond, who routinely angers Brexit supporters by calling
for Britain to remain close to the EU, will deliver a budget
plan on Monday. 
    He must juggle Prime Minister Theresa May's promise to end
austerity with his drive to clean up high levels of public debt,
all against the backdrop of huge uncertainty about Britain's
exit from the EU in just over five months' time.
    Amit Kara, a NIESR economist, said better-than-expected
growth in Britain's economy this year -- albeit still slow --
and progress in closing the budget deficit meant Hammond can
already fund May's plan for more spending on the health service.
    A smooth Brexit in March would mean higher economic growth
and tax revenues, allowing for more increases in spending.
    ""If we have a hard Brexit on the other hand, then we lose a
lot of this space,"" Kara said.
    A no-deal Brexit would push Britain's budget deficit up from
an estimated 1.7 percent of gross domestic product this year to
2.7 percent in two years' time, while public sector net debt
would rise slightly to around 86 percent of GDP before falling
only slowly by the mid-2020s, he said.
    Hammond has set himself a target of keeping the budget
deficit -- adjusted for swings in the economy -- below 2 percent
of GDP by 2020/21 and to cut debt as a share of economic output.
    NIESR said Britain's economy would grow by 1.4 and 1.9
percent in 2018 and 2019 respectively if a Brexit deal is done.
    But growth would slow to just 0.3 percent in 2019 and 2020
without a deal, it said.
    NIESR also said Hammond would eventually need to consider a
range of tax increases to help pay for higher public spending
after a decade of deep spending cuts for many services.

    ATHENS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A strong quake of magnitude 6.8
struck off Greece early on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey
said, but there were no initial reports of damage or casualties.
    The epicenter of the quake, initially reported as a
magnitude 7.0, was in the Ionian Sea, some 83 miles (133.5 km)
southwest of Patras in the Peloponnese.
    A fire brigade official in Athens said there were no early
reports of damage or casualties.
    The quake was fairly shallow, only 10.3 miles (16.5 km)
below the seabed, which would have amplified the shaking.
    It struck at 1:54 a.m. (2254 GMT Thursday) and was followed
about half an hour later by a 5.2 aftershock.
    Greece straddles two tectonic plates and often gets
earthquakes.

    * AB InBev self-reported anti-trust violations-sources

    * Three brewers were discussing prices, formed a
cartel-sources

    By Aditya Kalra
    NEW DELHI, Oct 25 (Reuters) - An Indian anti-trust probe
into beer price-fixing allegations was initiated after the
world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev told the authorities
last year it had detected an industry cartel, three people
familiar with the matter told Reuters.
    AB InBev <ABI.BR> discovered the Indian operations it
acquired as part of its around $100 billion acquisition of
London-listed rival SABMiller Plc in 2016 had for years fixed
beer prices along with Denmark's Carlsberg <CARLb.CO> and
India's United Breweries <UBBW.NS>, which is part-owned by
Heineken NV <HEIN.AS>, the sources said.
    AB InBev conducted an internal investigation in the first
half of last year, after closing the SABMiller deal, and found
that executives had discussed and agreed on their submission of
ex-brewery beer production prices to Indian state governments.
Those ex-brewery prices would include all the production and
marketing costs, as well as a proposed profit margin, and were
used by state governments to set a maximum retail price.
    ""It was startling,"" one of the sources said. ""Extensive
pricing information about the competition, some of which is
extremely confidential, was available to all the three
companies.""
    Earlier this month the Competition Commission of India (CCI)
raided the offices of all the three brewers and found e-mails
that showed executives were allegedly violating Indian
anti-trust laws, Reuters has previously reported. [nL4N1WS290]
    According to the three sources, those raids came after AB
InBev approached the anti-trust watchdog to make disclosures
under a so-called ""leniency programme"" that provides a
whistleblower-type protection for cartel members disclosing
wrongdoing.
    Sudhir Mittal, chairman of the CCI, did not respond to a
request for comment.
    A spokesman for AB InBev, whose Indian offerings include
Budweiser and Corona, said ""it would not be appropriate for us
to comment"" for this article. Carlsberg, which sells beer under
its own-name brand and also owns Tuborg, said it was ""committed
to complying"" with all relevant laws.
    United Breweries, which commands a 51 percent share of the
Indian market and sells the Kingfisher and Heineken beer brands
in India, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Heineken
declined to comment.
    Calls to Shalabh Seth, the managing director of SABMiller in
India at the time of the AB InBev acquisition, went unanswered.
He now works for United Breweries.
    After Reuters reported the CCI raids on Oct. 11, United
Breweries told the Indian stock exchanges the company took its
compliance obligations seriously and was reviewing its legal
risks and potential implications.
    Belgium-based AB InBev has said it takes anti-trust
compliance ""very seriously"".
    The three brewers, who according to Euromonitor
International account for 90 percent of beer consumption in the
$7 billion India market, together face a potential fine of up to
$272 million if they are found to have operated a cartel, the
sources said. Any company executives found to have fixed prices
could also be fined.
    AB InBev could escape some or all of its share of the fines
for self-reporting the issue.
    It was unclear how much the alleged price-fixing may have
cost consumers.
    
    HIGHLY-REGULATED MARKET
    The investigation will cast a further shadow on an Indian
beer business that already faces stringent compliance and
state-level regulation, making it tougher for brewers to expand.
    Though a young and affluent population, better social
acceptance towards drinking and a growing pub culture have
spurred beer consumption, many Indian drinkers still prefer
potent spirits, particularly whisky, especially in smaller towns
and villages.
    Most states individually regulate alcohol pricing and the
companies need to submit and get prices approved every year by
the local authorities. There are also separate labelling,
licensing and brand registration norms.
    The ex-brewery prices set by the companies are also the base
on which alcohol taxes, a vital source of state government
revenue, are imposed.
    That results in wild variations in retail prices. A 330 ml
bottle of Kingfisher costs 36 rupees (49 cents) in the tourist
state of Goa, but 130 rupees ($1.77) in the northern state of
Haryana, a major industrial hub, according to India's largest
beer chain, the Beer Cafe.
        
    RARE DAWN RAIDS
    As part of its investigation, the CCI secured permission
from a Delhi district judge to conduct search and seizure
operations at the brewers' offices, only the third such raids in
the watchdog's near 10-year history.
    The dawn raids were conducted in two Indian cities -
Bengaluru, previously known as Bangalore, in southern India and
Gurugram, near the capital New Delhi - by dozens of officers and
technology experts, five sources with knowledge of the probe
said.
    Over two days, senior company officials were questioned
about pricing, their computer hard-disks copied and mobile
phones cloned to analyse communications over WhatsApp.
    One source gave an example of an e-mail that showed the
companies were exchanging notes on their successes on achieving
better prices in a particular state, and how that model can be
replicated. The source described the communication as a ""brazen""
anti-trust violation.
    Reuters has not been able to independently verify the
contents of any e-mails.
    The watchdog suspects price-fixing in at least four Indian
states, one of the sources said. The CCI's investigation unit
will further question company executives and analyse the seized
evidence before making penalty recommendations in a report,
which will be reviewed by commission members in a process that
could take up to 12 months.
    The Indian probe is the latest anti-trust headache for
global brewers. Last year, the European Commission accused AB
InBev of abusing its market dominance in Belgium by impeding the
flow of cheaper imports into the country. In 2014, a German
regulator fined Carlsberg and smaller brewers for colluding on
prices.    
    
    ""BAFFLING"" MARKET
    The brewers are already facing an uphill struggle in India.
    An executive who has formerly worked for a foreign brewer in
India said local governments were reluctant to allow price
increases, fearing they would impact consumer purchases and, in
turn, their tax revenues.
    ""There is nobody making margins here other than the
governments, they want to maximize their revenue,"" the executive
said.
    Beyond pricing issues, sudden policy changes can also hit
brewers. In 2016, India's Supreme Court banned liquor sales
within 500 meters of highways and the same year the eastern
state of Bihar banned alcohol.
    Three other Indian states and one federally-controlled
island territory also ban or restrict alcohol sales.
    For Carlsberg, the Bihar state ban came just two years after
the company opened a new brewery there. At the time, its then
country head, Michael Jensen, said India was the ""most difficult
market in the world but you can't do stuff like that ... It is
very detrimental for investor confidence"".
    Top brewers also face a challenge from the growing
popularity of premium segment craft beers. Sequoia
Capital-backed B9 Beverages' ""Bira 91"" brand and a start-up
brand ""Simba"" have lured drinkers with quirky branding and
lighter brews.
    Simba clocked sales of $10.2 million last year and is
targeting a doubling this year, but could have grown at a faster
pace if not for the stringent and varied state government
regulations, its founder Prabhtej Singh Bhatia told Reuters.
    Bhatia said his working capital requirements have often been
strained by varied state policies - in Goa, for example, he said
registration of a new beer brand costs $328, compared with
$20,500 in Delhi.
    ""The market is very challenging, it's baffling,"" Bhatia
said.

879,5708,f5df6d763dcafed59fd139fcf89cbe5c,German consumers keen to spend in Nov even as economic expectations darken - GfK survey,2018-10-26 14:00:04,EUR,0.0,2018-10-26 14:00:58,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - German shoppers look keen to
spend in November, but their expectations for the economy and
their own personal income have slipped on worries about
international trade conflicts and Brexit, a survey showed on
Friday.
    Household spending has become the main source of expansion
in Europe's biggest economy in recent years, backed by
record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation
pay hikes and low borrowing costs.
    The Nuremberg-based GfK institute said its consumer climate
indicator remained unchanged going into November compared with
October at an index level of 10.6 points, slightly above a
Reuters poll consensus view of 10.5.
    GfK's subindex measuring propensity to buy rose further in
October, to 55.9 points, mainly prompted by a general feeling of
job security, prompting consumers to make larger purchases, GfK
said.
    ""Apparently unfazed by external risks such as trade
conflicts and Brexit, consumers are prepared to splash out.
After all, saving is still not an attractive alternative,"" GfK
researcher Rolf Buerkl said. 
    The sub-index measuring economic expectations, however,
dropped 8.1 points to 19.0.
    ""This is primarily due to external factors,"" Buerkl said. 
    ""The trade conflict between the USA and the EU has not been
fully resolved despite a period of calm, while the dispute with
China has even escalated,"" he said, adding that this was highly
unlikely to inspire consumer optimism. 
    The GfK survey was conducted from Oct. 5 to Oct. 19.

    
                                 NOV 18    OCT 18    NOV 17

 Consumer climate components     OCT 18    SEPT 18   OCT 17
 - willingness to buy            55.9      52.9      59.2

 - business cycle expectations   19.0      27.1      43.5
 
    NOTE - The consumer climate indicator forecasts the
development of real private consumption in the following month.
    An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth
in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop
compared with the same period a year ago.
    According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator
corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private
consumption.
    The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance
between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you
think now is a good time to buy major items?""
    The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations
about the development of household finances in the coming 12
months.
    The additional business cycle expectations index reflects
the assessment of those questioned of the general economic
situation in the next 12 months.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland
<RBS.L> said on Friday it had taken a 100 million pound ($128.16
million) impairment provision to account for greater economic
uncertainty - the first concrete sign that Brexit is clouding
the outlook of a major UK lender. 
    The provision suggests RBS is concerned that some of its
customers might become less able to pay their debts in future.
RBS is the first big UK bank to put money aside for this
eventuality five months ahead of Britain's departure from the
European Union.  
    It made the announcement while reporting its third quarter
results, including a pre-tax profit of 961 million pounds. 
    Its attributable profit stood at 448 million pounds, below
the 507 million pounds expected by analysts, according to a
bank-compiled average of their estimates. That compares to 392
million pounds earned over the same period in 2017.
    ""This is good performance, set against a highly competitive
market and an uncertain economic outlook,"" the bank's CEO Ross
McEwan in a statement. 
    Impairments rose to 240 million pounds from 143 million
pounds in the same quarter last year, the bank said, attributing
the rise to a more uncertain economic outlook as Britain
prepares to depart from the EU.
    With the March 2019 deadline fast approaching, negotiations
between London and Brussels have yet to secure a deal that will
govern their divorce, leaving businesses in the dark about how
they will interact with EU markets after that date. 
    RBS also reported a common equity tier one capital ratio of
16.7 percent. That leaves the bank's capital well above its
target of 13 percent, even after it paid its first dividend in a
decade and a hefty fine to U.S. authorities earlier this year. 
    It reaffirmed its targets on cost to income ratio and return
on tangible equity, but gave no clue as to its future dividend
policy - information shareholders are hungry for after being
starved of payouts for 10 years.

    Draghi also said that the ruling coalition, made up of the
far-right League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement, should stop questioning ""the constitutional
existential framework of the euro"".
    Bagnai, who is a eurosceptic economist and author of the

""There is no risk of Italy leaving the euro. We have no
intention now or in the future of giving up the euro.""

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: STOCKS TO TUMBLE, VALEO SINKS ON PROFIT WARNING (0653 GMT)
    It looked set to be a day of heavy losses for equity investors with European futures down
sharply – 0.6 to 0.9 percent - after U.S. futures tumbled following results from Amazon and
Alphabet– prompting renewed concerns about the dominance of tech in this market cycle. 
    Car parts maker Valeo could be the biggest faller of the day, indicated down 10 to 15
percent after its results missed estimates by 22 percent and it slashed guidance for next year
by 11 percent. The warnings echoed Daimler’s and others in the auto sector flagging disruption
from tougher European emissions tests and slower sales in China, and the sector could be bruised
as a result.
    Stronger results from British Airways owner IAG could help the travel & leisure sector which
has been under pressure with airlines warning of fuel costs rising. 
    With some analysts citing a report Brexit talks are in deadlock, Britain’s FTSE 100 will be
a focus although sterling was unchanged on the day. Lender RBS said it had taken a 100 million
pound impairment provision to account for greater economic uncertainty, the first concrete sign
Brexit is clouding the outlook for banks. 
    Investors will also be digesting the impact on healthcare companies, including Roche and
Novartis, of Trump's plan announced overnight to create a global pricing index for prescription
drugs based on lower prices paid in other countries. [nL2N1X51RI]
    Of the Europe-listed pharma names, Roche, Ipsen, Grifols and UCB have the biggest exposure
to the U.S. Medicare Part B according to Goldman Sachs. One trading desk saw Roche falling 2
percent on the news.

    By Angeliki Koutantou and Michele Kambas
    ATHENS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake shook
western Greece early on Friday, damaging a port and a 15th
century monastery, but causing no major injuries, officials and
local media said.
    The quake sent out tremors felt as far afield as Libya,
Italy, Malta and Albania. Greek authorities initially issued a
tsunami warning then withdrew the alert.
    The magnitude 6.4 quake struck in the Ionian Sea, 50 km (31
miles) south of the island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante,
Greece's Geodynamic Institute reported. The U.S. Geological
Survey rated the magnitude at 6.8.
    Three people were taken to hospital on the island, two of
them slightly injured, a spokesman for Greece's civil protection
agency said. A series of aftershocks, the highest at 5.6,
rattled the island and power was briefly disrupted.
    Tremors damaged a 15th-century monastery on the nearby
islands of Strofades, local media in Zakynthos reported. They
also left large cracks in the port of Zakynthos, though
authorities there said operations would continue as usual.
    ""We are not facing any particular problems,"" Zakynthos Mayor
Pavlos Kolokotsas told Greek state broadcaster ERT. ""Calm is
being restored.""
    Extensive damage was avoided because quake-prone Zakynthos 
had adopted seismic protection codes in construction, said
Efthymios Lekkas, head of Greece's Earthquake Planning and
Protection Organisation said .
    ""The energy unleashed, based on the angle of the faultline,
fanned out towards Italy,"" he added.
    Italy's Il Messaggero online news site said the quake was
felt hundreds of kilometres away in southern Italy. Firefighters
in Calabria, Puglia and Sicily received thousands of telephone
calls from worried locals.
    Zakynthos was all but destroyed in a 6.8 tremor in 1953.
More than 140 people were killed in an earthquake north of
Athens in 1999.
    The quake was fairly shallow, according to the USGS, just 14
km (8.7 miles) below the seabed, which would have amplified
shaking.
    It struck at 1:54 a.m. (2254 GMT, Thursday). Greece
straddles two tectonic plates and often suffers earthquakes.
    The EMSC European quake agency said sea levels had risen
slightly, by about 20 cm (7.87 inches), but the increase could
be higher locally. It later tweeted sea level changes were also
observed in Italy.

    By Emma Rumney and Lawrence White
    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>
has taken a 100 million pound ($128 million) impairment
provision to account for greater economic uncertainty in the
first concrete sign Brexit is clouding the outlook of a big
British bank.
    The provision means RBS is concerned that its customers
might become less able to pay their debts when Britain leaves
the European Union in five months' time. RBS is the first big UK
bank to put money aside for this eventuality. 
    CEO Ross McEwan said RBS was taking into account the
possibility of more negative outcomes from the Brexit
negotiations, under new accounting standards that require banks
to be better prepared for possible future losses. 
    ""There's a lot more uncertainty in the marketplace until we
get agreement, and that's what this is reflecting,"" McEwan told
reporters on a call, referring to the provision. 
    The fortunes of major lenders like RBS are closely
intertwined with the health of UK consumers and businesses.
    The bank has been less upbeat about the consequences of
Brexit than some of its peers, with McEwan warning recently that
Britain could slip into recession if it crashes out of the EU
with no deal. [nL8N1WK0WX]
    Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Thursday
banks in Britain must hold enough cash to withstand any
disorderly Brexit hitting financial markets. [nL8N1X583G]
    RBS's rival Lloyds <LLOY.L> said on Thursday it was
confident that negotiations between London and Brussels could
still deliver a withdrawal agreement, which remains elusive even
after years of tense talks. [nL8N1X51MM]
    Both banks said that they had seen no sign borrowers'
ability to service their loans had deteriorated so far.
    
    PROFIT MISS
    McEwan said he had participated in a call with Prime
Minister Theresa May and executives last week and received an
optimistic signal that a Brexit deal could be reached. 
    But with the March 2019 deadline fast approaching,
businesses remain in the dark about how they will interact with
EU markets and the impact Brexit will have on the UK economy.
    The provision, announced with RBS's third quarter results,
took the bank's impairments for the period to 240 million
pounds, up from 143 million pounds in 2017. 
    It also reported a pre-tax profit of 961 million pounds and
an attributable profit of 448 million pounds. This was below the
507 million pounds expected by analysts, according to a
bank-compiled average of their estimates. 
    RBS, whose shares opened 4 percent lower on Friday, reported
a common equity tier one capital ratio of 16.7 percent. 
    That leaves the bank's capital well above its target of 13
percent, even after it paid its first dividend in a decade and a
hefty fine to U.S. authorities earlier this year. 
    The bank took another 200 million pound provision for
mis-sold payment protection insurance - Britain's costliest such
scandal that has seen RBS alone pay out over 5 billion pounds.
    It gave no clue as to its future dividend policy -
information shareholders are hungry for after being starved of
payouts for 10 years.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The British pound laboured near
seven-week lows against the dollar on Friday and three-week lows
versus the euro, as doubt grows about whether the UK and the
European Union can clinch a Brexit deal.
    Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported
on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister
Theresa May's cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how
to proceed for the negotiations to restart.
    The report sent sterling to a day's low of $1.2805 <GBP=D3>
before the pound recovered to trade flat at $1.2820. That leaves
the pound close to seven-week lows hit on Thursday of $1.2795.
    The British currency was largely unchanged versus the euro,
at 88.76 pence per euro <EURGBP=D3>, after earlier weakening to
a three-week low.
    ""GBP remains in its usual state of flummox as the Brexit
impasse continues, with politics at home the biggest stumbling
block. Until this is resolved, we expect GBP/USD to trade below
$1.30,"" said Viraj Patel, a currencies analyst at ING.
    With Brexit dominating the news agenda, Britain's economic
fortunes have taken a backseat. 
    Next week, the Bank of England is expected to leave interest
rates unchanged and stress that while there are some signs of
rising wage and price pressures, it will not be ready to tighten
policy until there is clarity on Brexit.
    ""Fears of a no-deal Brexit and the wider risk-off market
move have seen the (UK interest rate) curve flatten. Next week's
BoE policy statement is likely to restate the need for higher
rates and we see scope for a steeper front end to money
markets,"" Societe Generale analysts said in a note to clients.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>

    The provision means RBS is concerned that its customers

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: SEA OF RED ON TECH TREMORS, EARNINGS ANXIETY (0800 GMT)
    The STOXX is set for its worst month since Aug 2015 as it sinks down 1.1 percent this
morning in a broad selloff after results misses from Amazon and Alphabet renewed anxiety about
how fragile this tech-fuelled bull market might turn out to be.
    Results-wise it's a triptych of terror for European investors: So far three main negative
trends have emerged from company results: higher raw material and wage costs, the impact of
tariffs, and a slowdown in China. 
    No surprises then that analysts are downgrading their MSCI Europe earning estimates at the
fastest pace since Feb 2016, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

European emissions rules and slowing China sales - driving its shares down 17 percent while peer
Faurecia falls 6.9 percent. [nL8N1X58SI]

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: STOCKS TO TUMBLE, VALEO SINKS ON PROFIT WARNING (0653 GMT)
    It looked set to be a day of heavy losses for equity investors with European futures down
sharply – 0.6 to 0.9 percent - after U.S. futures tumbled following results from Amazon and
Alphabet– prompting renewed concerns about the dominance of tech in this market cycle. 
    Car parts maker Valeo could be the biggest faller of the day, indicated down 10 to 15
percent after its results missed estimates by 22 percent and it slashed guidance for next year
by 11 percent. The warnings echoed Daimler’s and others in the auto sector flagging disruption
from tougher European emissions tests and slower sales in China, and the sector could be bruised
as a result.
    Stronger results from British Airways owner IAG could help the travel & leisure sector which
has been under pressure with airlines warning of fuel costs rising. 
    With some analysts citing a report Brexit talks are in deadlock, Britain’s FTSE 100 will be
a focus although sterling was unchanged on the day. Lender RBS said it had taken a 100 million
pound impairment provision to account for greater economic uncertainty, the first concrete sign
Brexit is clouding the outlook for banks. 
    Investors will also be digesting the impact on healthcare companies, including Roche and
Novartis, of Trump's plan announced overnight to create a global pricing index for prescription
drugs based on lower prices paid in other countries. [nL2N1X51RI]
    Of the Europe-listed pharma names, Roche, Ipsen, Grifols and UCB have the biggest exposure
to the U.S. Medicare Part B according to Goldman Sachs. One trading desk saw Roche falling 2
percent on the news.

    FUTURES DOWN SHARPLY AS TECH SELLOFF, BREXIT DEADLOCK SAP RISK APPETITE (0617 GMT)
    Futures have opened sharply lower, suggesting it's going to be a pretty heavy fall for
European stocks after U.S. stock futures tumbled overnight on Amazon and Alphabet results.    
    A Bloomberg report that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Cabinet is not close enough to
agreeing a way forward for top level Brexit negotiations to resume is likely to add further

    EUROPEAN MARKETS HEADING SOUTH AGAIN (0525 GMT) 
    Any hope of a sustained recovery after yesterday's modest recovery across European markets
will be dashed, with the market's facing further pressure at the open today, taking their lead
from Asian and U.S. markets overnight.
    FTSE 100 is expected to open 64 points lower at 6,940, DAX is expected to open 117 points
down at 11,190 and CAC 40 is expected to open 62 points lower at 4,970, according to David
Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Total sent its CEO
to Riyadh for Saudi’s flagship conference despite its role in a
Saudi journalist’s death. HSBC fielded a big team, too. Firms
strive to be larger, profitable and ethical, but often only
achieve the first two. Profit’s lead over ethics appears to be
narrowing.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné attended the Future
Investment Initiative held in Saudi Arabia on Oct. 23-25. CEOs
from a range of companies including BlackRock, Société Générale,
and JPMorgan withdrew from the investment conference after the
killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi rulers,
at the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate.
    - “I am convinced that an 'empty chairs at the table'
strategy serves no useful purpose, especially when it comes to
respect for human rights,” Pouyanné said on Oct. 22.
    - Total said on Oct. 26 that third-quarter net operating
income rose to $4.5 billion, up 49 percent from a year earlier,
helped by a doubling of exploration and production net operating
income to $2.9 billion.
    - The French energy group said adjusted net income rose 48
percent over the same period to $4 billion, and this month
announced a $9 billion petrochemicals project in cooperation
with Saudi Aramco.
    - HSBC and Credit Suisse sent the biggest team of bankers to
the Future Investment Initiative, IFR reported on Oct. 24.
    - Total shares were trading at 50.3 euros, as of 0805 GMT on
Oct. 26, down 2.2 percent.

895,5787,c4a730ee764380961f8c7a4a37343ef3,Italy pays highest yield since August 2013 at zero-coupon sale,2018-10-26 17:33:13,EUR,0.0,2018-10-26 17:33:17,{'EUR': 'Neutral'},"    MILAN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Italy paid the most in more than
five years to sell zero-coupon paper on Friday at the first debt
sale since Moody's downgraded the country's debt to one notch
above junk status citing concerns over government budget plans.
    The 3 billion euro ($3.4 billion) sale of a new zero-coupon
bond maturing in November 2020 comes ahead of a review of
Italy's 'BBB' rating by S&P's on Friday night. 
    Italy sold the top planned amount at auction but the yield
rose to 1.626 percent versus the 0.715 rate it paid a month ago
on the previous zero-coupon benchmark which matures in May 2020.
    The risk premium Italy pays over safer German Bunds has
climbed to a 5-1/2 year high due to Rome's plans to raise next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output under a draft
budget which has been rejected by the European Commission.    
    Rome, which must submit a new budget within three weeks or
face disciplinary action, has so far refused to trim the deficit
goal. [nL8N1WS11V]
    Italy on Friday also sold 996 million euros of an
inflation-linked bond due in May 2028. The bond fetched a real
yield of 2.34 percent. It had last been sold in July at 1.55
percent.
    The Treasury will offer 6 billion euros of six-month bills
on Monday. The real market test following S&P's verdict,
however, will be Tuesday's sale of up to 5.5 billion euros in
longer term bonds. [nS8N1X5000] ($1 = 0.8793 euros)

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Madrid-October 26: Fitch Ratings has downgraded AyT Deuda 
Subordinada 1, FTA and withdrawn the ratings as follows:

Class B: downgraded to 'Dsf' from 'CCsf'; recovery estimate of 0%; and withdrawn

Class C: downgraded to 'Dsf' from 'Csf'; recovery estimate of 0%; and withdrawn

Fitch is withdrawing the ratings of AyT Deuda Subordinada 1, FTA's class B and C 
notes following default. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or 
analytical coverage for AyT Deuda Subordinada 1, FTA class B and C notes.

The transaction is a securitisation that originally consisted of a portfolio of 
10-year bullet subordinated bonds, originated by nine Spanish banks. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS

No Remaining Assets For Class B And C 

On 1 February 2018, the remaining assets (consisting of Bankia equity shares) 
backing the notes were sold and, on the February payment date, the overall sale 
proceeds were used to pay in full the class A notes. The class B  and C notes 
were not redeemed in full on the February payment date.

Issuer Ceased to Exist

As there were no remaining assets in the portfolio, AyT Deuda Subordinada 1 was 
terminated and ceased to exist on 7 August 2018, when its Act of Extinction was 
formalised by a Spanish notary and the trustee. As of this date, the remaining 
unpaid principal balance on the class B notes was EUR29.5 million and on the 
class C notes was EUR22.8 million (equal to its original balance). Furthermore 
the class C notes had unpaid interest for EUR0.57 million. Hence Fitch has 
downgraded both classes to 'Dsf', with recovery estimate (RE) of 0% and has 
withdrawn the ratings.

relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has 
received about the performance of the asset pool and the transactions. There 
were no findings that affected the rating analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the 
results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio information or 
conducted a review of origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring.

The majority of the underlying assets or risk-presenting entities have ratings 
or credit opinions from Fitch and/or other Nationally Recognised Statistical 
Rating Organisations and/or European Securities and Markets Authority-registered 
rating agencies. Fitch has relied on the practices of the relevant groups within 
Fitch and/or other rating agencies to assess the asset portfolio information.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the information relied upon for the agency's 
rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that 
it is adequately reliable.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The state-owned UK
lender’s 100 mln pound provision to cover the risk of a messy UK
exit from the EU is trifling given its loan-book size. Yet
private UK banks have taken the same step less noisily. A decade
after it was rescued, RBS still wears its public embrace
uncomfortably.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland said on Oct. 26 it had
taken a 100 million pound impairment provision to account for
greater economic uncertainty.
    - It made the announcement while reporting its third-quarter
results, which included a pre-tax profit of 961 million pounds.
    - RBS’s net profit stood at 448 million pounds, below the
507 million pounds expected by analysts, according to a
bank-compiled average of their estimates. That compares to 392
million pounds earned over the same period in 2017.
    - Impairments rose to 240 million pounds from 143 million
pounds in the same quarter last year, the bank said, attributing
the rise to a more uncertain economic outlook as Britain
prepares to depart from the EU.
    - The bank’s net interest margin, a metric that shows how
much a bank generates in income from money it lends, decreased
by 8 basis points to 1.93 percent. 
    - RBS also reported a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of
16.7 percent. That leaves the bank’s capital well above its
target of 13 percent, even after it paid its first dividend in a
decade and a hefty fine to U.S. authorities earlier this year.
    - Share in RBS were down 4.7 percent at 223 pence a share by
0745GMT on Oct. 26.

debt
    * Revised plan could be agreed by EU envoys next week
    * Bad loans down but still saddling southern banks

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European Union states are close
to a deal on rules for banks saddled with bad loans, according
to diplomats and EU documents, with a plan that would give banks
less time to build a backstop against new soured debt.
    Euro zone banks have yet to recover from the 2008 financial
crisis, and this year their shares dropped more than 20 percent
<.SX7P>. Italian banks have fallen nearly 30 percent <.FTIT8300>
and seen increased losses after a eurosceptic government took
office in Rome in June.
    The new rules, if adopted, could cause them further trouble.
They would have only seven years, instead of eight, to build a
backstop that would fully covered new bad loans secured by
collateral, under an EU proposal seen by Reuters. 
    The plan, prepared by the Austrian presidency of the
European Union, would amend legislative proposals made by the
European Commission in March for common minimum levels of money
banks need to set aside against bad loans. [nL8N1QW3PL]
    EU governments broadly agree on the overhaul, an EU internal
document said. One negotiator said he was ""very confident"" EU
envoys would agree a compromise at a meeting next week.
    Despite a gradual offloading of bad loans, euro zone banks
still hold 731 billion euros ($831.22 billion) of debt they
might not be able to recover, according to European Banking
Authority's latest available data.
    Assets of banks that do not build a sufficient backstop
would automatically be devalued under the proposed rules. The
rules would apply only to new loans.
    ""Loopholes"" that would have allowed lenders to set aside
less money for some loans have also been eliminated from the
proposal, a diplomat involved in the negotiations said. 
           
    ITALY'S WORRIES
    In a concession to countries where banks hold higher levels
of bad debt, EU governments are backing an extension to three
years from two that banks have to cover new unsecured, riskier
loans that go bad. 
    Non-performing loans make up an average of just 3.6 percent
of total lending at EU banks. But in Greece they account for
nearly half of loans and in Italy almost 10 percent.
    Italy is pushing for nine years to build buffers against
losses on loans that are secured by immovable collateral, such
as houses or commercial properties, confidential documents show.
Southern countries back that proposal and a diplomat said it
could be accepted by all 28 governments. 
    But in return for this concession, the new measures would be
backdated to March 2018, effectively shortening the period banks
would have. Austria had proposed applying the new measures only
to new loans originated after the rules are adopted.
    The European Parliament, which would have to agree with
changes proposed by EU government, is divided over the reform,
said Roberto Gualtieri, one of the leading lawmakers on the
matter. If no agreement is reached before European elections in
May, the overhaul may be shelved.

    MOSCOW, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Mikhail Gorbachev, the last
Soviet leader, denounced on Friday a U.S. decision to leave an
arms control treaty that helped end the Cold War, saying it
heralded a new arms race which increased the risk of nuclear
conflict.
    President Donald Trump has said Washington plans to quit the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Gorbachev
and Ronald Reagan signed in 1987. The pact eliminated all short-
and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional
missiles held by both countries in Europe.
    Gorbachev, in a column for the New York Times newspaper,
said the U.S. move was ""a dire threat to peace"" that he still
hoped might be reversed through negotiations. 
    ""I am being asked whether I feel bitter watching the demise
of what I worked so hard to achieve. But this is not a personal
matter. Much more is at stake,"" he wrote.  ""A new arms race has
been announced.""
    Washington has cited Russia's alleged violation of the
treaty as its reason for leaving it, a charge Moscow denies.
Russia in turn accuses Washington of breaking the pact. 
    Stationing of U.S. land-based nuclear missiles in western
Europe provoked mass protests in the 1980s. Some U.S. allies now
fear Washington might deploy a new generation of them in Europe,
with Russia doing the same in its exclave of Kaliningrad, once
again turning the continent into a potential nuclear
battlefield.
    If the United States made good on its pledge to leave the
treaty, Gorbachev said he hoped that U.S. allies would refuse to
be what he called launchpads for American missiles which Trump
has spoken of developing. 
    President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would
be forced to target any European countries that agreed to host 
U.S. missiles. [nL8N1X47UT]
    Gorbachev, 87, said that any disputes about compliance could
be solved if there were sufficient political will. 
    It was clear, however, that Trump's aim was to release the
United States from global constraints, he said, accusing
Washington of destroying the ""system of international treaties
and accords"" that underpinned peace and security after World War
Two.
    ""Yet I am convinced that those who hope to benefit from a
global free-for-all are deeply mistaken. There will be no winner
in a 'war of all against all' — particularly if it ends in a
nuclear war. And that is a possibility that cannot be ruled out.
An unrelenting arms race, international tensions, hostility and
universal mistrust will only increase the risk.""

    The STOXX is set for its worst month since Aug 2015 as it sinks down 1.1 percent this
morning in a broad selloff after results misses from Amazon and Alphabet renewed anxiety about
how fragile this tech-fuelled bull market might turn out to be.
    Results-wise it's a triptych of terror for European investors: So far three main negative
trends have emerged from company results: higher raw material and wage costs, the impact of
tariffs, and a slowdown in China.

fastest pace since Feb 2016, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: STOCKS TO TUMBLE, VALEO SINKS ON PROFIT WARNING (0653 GMT)
    It looked set to be a day of heavy losses for equity investors with European futures down
sharply – 0.6 to 0.9 percent - after U.S. futures tumbled following results from Amazon and
Alphabet– prompting renewed concerns about the dominance of tech in this market cycle. 
    Car parts maker Valeo could be the biggest faller of the day, indicated down 10 to 15
percent after its results missed estimates by 22 percent and it slashed guidance for next year
by 11 percent. The warnings echoed Daimler’s and others in the auto sector flagging disruption
from tougher European emissions tests and slower sales in China, and the sector could be bruised
as a result.
    Stronger results from British Airways owner IAG could help the travel & leisure sector which
has been under pressure with airlines warning of fuel costs rising. 
    With some analysts citing a report Brexit talks are in deadlock, Britain’s FTSE 100 will be
a focus although sterling was unchanged on the day. Lender RBS said it had taken a 100 million
pound impairment provision to account for greater economic uncertainty, the first concrete sign
Brexit is clouding the outlook for banks.

    EUROPEAN MARKETS HEADING SOUTH AGAIN (0525 GMT) 
    Any hope of a sustained recovery after yesterday's modest recovery across European markets
will be dashed, with the market's facing further pressure at the open today, taking their lead
from Asian and U.S. markets overnight.
    FTSE 100 is expected to open 64 points lower at 6,940, DAX is expected to open 117 points
down at 11,190 and CAC 40 is expected to open 62 points lower at 4,970, according to David
Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.

 (Adds details, background)
    By Margarita Antidze
    TBILISI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Georgia's presidential election
will go to a second round runoff between two of the country's
former foreign ministers after no single candidate won outright
in the first round of voting, the country's Central Election
Commission (CEC) said on Monday.
    After all the votes from Sunday's first round of voting had
been counted French-born former diplomat and foreign minister
Salome Zurabishvili had secured 38.7 percent of the vote, while
Grigol Vashadze, also a former foreign minister, had won 37.7
percent of the vote, the CEC said.
    With neither managing to get more than 50 percent of the
vote necessary to win outright, a runoff between Zurabishvili
and Vashadze will now be held sometime between now and Dec. 2.
    Constitutional changes have weakened the power of the
presidency, handing most authority to the office of prime
minister.
    But the post is still seen as important for the image abroad
of a country which is strongly oriented towards the West and
fearful of Russia, which fought a short war against Georgia a
decade ago after which it recognised the independence of two
breakaway Georgian regions.
    The country of 3.7 million people is Washington's strategic
ally in the Caucasus region. It also hopes to eventually join
the EU and NATO. Pipelines carrying Caspian oil and gas to
Europe run across its territory.     
    
    FORMER FOREIGN MINISTERS 
    Tamar Zhvania, the head of the CEC, said that there were
some irregularities, but that no serious violations had taken
place during the election.
    Zurabishvili was backed by the ruling Georgian Dream Party,
while Vashadze was running on behalf of a new platform of 11
opposition parties led by former president Mikheil Saakashvili's
United National Movement (UNM).
    Opposition parties complained about alleged pressure on
voters from government officials, reported attempts to bribe
voters, and irregularities during vote counting.
    Zurabishvili, 66, a former French career diplomat, was born
to Georgian emigre parents in France and served as French
ambassador to Georgia before becoming Georgia's foreign minister
in 2004.
    Supporters say she would bring international stature to the
presidency, while opponents criticise her for statements that
appeared to blame Georgia for war with Russia in 2008 and
remarks about minorities that some saw as xenophobic.
    Her rival Vashadze, 60, a diplomat and businessman, served
as Georgia's foreign minister from 2008-2012. 
    Losing candidate David Bakradze, a former parliamentary
speaker, said he would support Vashadze in the runoff.

    ISTANBUL, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Saudi public prosecutor
heading the investigation into the killing of journalist Jamal

    President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Turkey values the

consulate in Istanbul where Khashoggi was killed nearly four

says flew in hours before the killing and carried it out.

killing would be prosecuted in the kingdom. [nD5N1X200D]

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar rose towards a 10-week
high against a basket of other currencies on Monday as concerns
about global growth pervaded markets. 
    World stocks have sold off in October, beset by worries over
corporate earnings and geopolitical uncertainty.
    That has lifted the dollar - a currency that typically
outperforms in risk-off periods - but the currency has
strengthened only moderately.
    ""This likely reflects a number of factors, including long
dollar positioning and, by the end of this week, some modest
repricing of Federal Reserve expectations,"" said Zach Pandl,
co-head of foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs.
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.2 percent to 96.517 after
gaining 0.7 percent last week when it hit a ten-month high. 
    The duelling tariffs imposed by the United States and China
have also lifted the dollar. The market has assumed that while
the U.S. economy will be hit by reduced trade, it will be hurt
less than its trading partners.
    ""There seems little short-term catalyst for investors to
move away from overweight positions in the high-yielding
dollar,"" said ING's head of FX strategy Chris Turner.
    ""Keeping the dollar bid this week should be a continuation
of strong U.S. data. At the same time, we will be watching
developments in China,"" he said.   
    After weekend data showing Chinese profit growth slowed for
the fifth straight month in September, China's offshore yuan
weakened, though it remained above Friday's trough of 6.977
<CNH=EBS>, the weakest since January last year, as it creeps
ever closer to 7.00. 
    ""Were that to break, we would expect USD/Asia, and probably
USD/EM in general, to take another leg higher and the dollar to
be bid across the board,"" said Turner.
    The U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third
quarter, data showed on Friday, as the strongest consumer
spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory
investment offset a tariff-related drop in soybean exports.
    
    BOLSONARO WINS
    Among emerging markets, Brazilian-linked stocks got a lift
from the victory in the country's presidential election of
far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on promises
to clean up politics and crack down on crime.
    As of 0930 GMT, the real <BRL=> had not yet traded. It had
ended Friday's session at 3.6426 per dollar.
    The safe-haven Japanese yen <JPY=D3> has benefited from the
global sell-off in riskier assets as investors unwound carry
trade exposures. It gained 0.6 percent last week and on Monday
traded flat at 111.96 per dollar.
    Investors will be watching the Bank of Japan's monetary
policy announcement, due on Wednesday.
    The euro <EUR=EBS> hovered around $1.1389, its lowest in
more than two months. Investors saw some relief after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition partners gave her
conservatives until next year to deliver more policy results.
[nL8N1X804M] 
    However, concerns loomed over her future after both parties
suffered in a regional election on Sunday.
    Sterling <GBP=D3> held near a two-month trough of $1.2775
before Britain's annual budget due Monday. 
    Finance Minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his
Conservative Party to back the government's plan for Brexit, or
put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity. [nL8N1X80ZP]

 (Updates with human remains found, detail on those on board)
    By Fergus Jensen and Tommy Ardiansyah
    PAKISJAYA, Indonesia, Oct 29 (Reuters) - An Indonesian
aircraft with 189 people on board crashed into the sea and sank
on Monday soon after taking off from the capital, Jakarta, on a
domestic flight to a tin-mining region, officials said.
    There was no sign of any survivors from Lion Air flight
JT610, an almost new Boeing 737 MAX 8, and rescue officials said
later on Monday they had recovered some human remains from the
crash site, about 15 km (9 miles) off the coast.
    The plane lost contact with ground officials shortly after
its pilot had asked to turn back to base, about 13 minutes after
it took off, officials said.
    Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation
markets, although its safety record is patchy. If all aboard
have died, the crash would be the country's second-worst air
disaster since 1997, industry experts said.
    ""We don't know yet whether there are any survivors,"" search
and rescue agency head Muhmmad Syaugi told a news conference,
adding that no distress signal had been received from the
aircraft's emergency transmitter. 
    ""We hope, we pray, but we cannot confirm.""
    At least 23 government officials, four employees of state
tin miner PT Timah and 3 employees of a Timah subsidiary were on
the plane. A Lion Air official said on Italian passenger and one
Indian pilot were on board.
    The plane went down in waters about 30 metres to 35 metres
(98 to 115 ft) deep. Items such as handphones and life vests
were found, along with the body parts.
    Ambulances were lined up at Karawang, on the coast east of
Jakarta and police were preparing rubber dinghies, a Reuters
reporter said. Fishing boats were being used to help search.
    Edward Sirait, chief executive of Lion Air Group, told
reporters the aircraft had a technical problem on a flight from
the resort island of Bali to Jakarta but it had been ""resolved
according to procedure"".
    Sirait declined to specify the nature of the issue but said
none of its other aircraft of that model had the same problem.
Lion had operated 11 Boeing 737 Max 8s and it had no plan to
ground the rest of them, he said.
    The accident is the first to be reported involving the
widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient
version of the manufacturer's workhorse single-aisle jet.
    Privately owned Lion Air said the aircraft had been in
operation since August, was airworthy, with its pilot and
co-pilot together having accumulated 11,000 hours of flying
time. [nS7N1SL02I]
    
    'BE PATIENT'
    The flight took off from Jakarta at around 6.20 a.m. and was
due to have landed in Pangkal Pinang, capital of the
Bangka-Belitung tin mining region, at 7.20 a.m.
    Distraught relatives of those on board arrived at the
airport in Jakarta and Pangkal Pinang.
    ""Be patient, pray the best for papa,"" one woman arriving at
Jakarta airport told a sobbing girl.
    The woman declined to speak to reporters.
    The head of Indonesia's transport safety committee said he
hoped the cause of the crash would be determined when the
plane's black boxes, as the cockpit voice recorder and data
flight recorder are known, were recovered.
    ""The plane is so modern, it transmits data from the plane,
and that we will review too. But the most important is the
blackbox,"" said Soerjanto Tjahjono. 
    Safety experts say nearly all accidents are caused by a
combination of factors and only rarely have a single
identifiable cause.
    The weather was clear, Tjahjono said.
    President Joko Widodo told a news conference authorities
were focusing on the search and rescue, and he called for the
country's prayers and support.
    The effort to find the wreckage and retrieve the black boxes
represents a major challenge for investigators in Indonesia,
where an AirAsia Airbus jet crashed in the Java Sea in December
2015.
    Under international rules, the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board will automatically assist with the inquiry into
Monday's crash, backed up by technical advisers from Boeing and
U.S.-French engine maker CFM International, co-owned by General
Electric <GE.N> and Safran <SAF.PA>.
    Boeing was deeply saddened by the loss, it said in a
statement, and was ready to provide technical assistance for the
investigation.
    Data from FlightRadar24 shows the first sign of something
amiss was around two minutes into the flight, when the plane had
reached 2,000 feet (610 m). 
    Then it descended more than 500 feet (152 m) and veered to
the left before climbing again to 5,000 feet (1,524 m), where it
stayed during most of the rest of the flight. 
    It began gaining speed in the final moments and reached 345
knots (397 mph) before data was lost when it was at 3,650 feet
(1,113 m).
    Indonesia's worst air disaster was in 1997, when a Garuda
Indonesia A300 crashed in the city of Medan killing 214 people.
    Founded in 1999, Lion Air's only fatal accident was in 2004,
when an MD-82 crashed upon landing at Solo City, killing 25 of
the 163 on board, the Flight Safety Foundation's Aviation Safety
Network says. 
    In April, the airline announced a firm order to buy 50
Boeing 737 MAX 10 narrowbody jets with a list price of $6.24
billion. It is one of the U.S. planemaker's largest customers
globally. [nL3N1RN39L]

railway operator Ferrovie Dello Stato Italiane, for 22 million
euros ($25.05 million).
    TrainOSE, which Greece sold to Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane

was deemed too low by Greece, which asked the operator to raise
it.

from the Italian company. [nL5N1LV1LN]

    * Her conservatives want a succession plan
    * SPD partners rethink coalition government

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
faced calls on Monday from her own conservatives to cede the
party's leadership, further eroding her authority after painful
losses in a regional election.
    Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) came home first in
Sunday's election in the western state of Hesse but support fell
by more than 11 points, reigniting a succession debate by
conservatives unhappy with the chancellor's grip on power.
    She will also have to contend with pressure from her Social
Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners, who have also bled
support in Hesse and are under pressure to rethink their
alliance with Merkel.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles, whose party saw support fall to
its lowest since 1946, has threatened to end the alliance with
Merkel's conservatives if there is no improvement on policy.
    Merkel, chancellor for 13 years, will have to invest her
political capital and tactical acumen to keep together her
loveless coalition, borne out of necessity seven months ago
after an inconclusive federal election last year.
    This will distract her from tending to major challenges at
home and abroad - ranging from overcoming a digital deficit and
pushing the German car industry toward cleaner mobility to
seeing through euro zone reforms and managing Britain's planned
departure from the European Union.
    ""The election results show that people expect renewal from
the CDU,"" conservative lawmaker Matern von Marschall told the
Stuttgarter newspaper.
    His CDU colleague Christian von Steffen was more blunt: ""We
need a meaningful programme with a clear path and new faces.""
    A senior CDU member told Reuters that party leaders wanted
to discuss the possibility of Merkel reversing her decision to
seek re-election as party chairwoman in December.
    ""This should be discussed,"" the member of the CDU governing
board told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. CDU leaders
will meet next Sunday to prepare for a summit in December where
party members will vote for a new chairman.
    Nahles is also feeling the heat from SPD members still
disgruntled with their leaders' decision to join Merkel instead
of fulfilling an election promise to sit in opposition if they
fail to win the federal vote. 
    Nahles said on Sunday she would propose a roadmap to allow
the SPD to measure the progress of the ruling coalition, which
has been plagued by infighting, at a mid-term review next year. 
    Her proposal did little to appease the head of the SPD's
youth wing, who said the election in Hesse was a clear signal
that the ruling coalition was not viable.
    ""The final verdict on the coalition has been spoken,"" Kevin
Kuehnert wrote in Twitter. ""Voters don't want 'business as
usual.'"" 
    Merkel's coalition was twice on the brink of collapse, once
over immigration policy and then over a dispute about the fate
of the domestic intelligence chief who was accused of harbouring
far-right views.
    The instability has further eroded the credibility of the
conservatives and the SPD in the eyes of German voters, who are
increasingly turning to smaller parties on the right and on the
left.
    In Hesse, where Merkel's CDU rule with the ecologist Greens,
the two biggest winners were the Greens and the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD).

 (Adds detail, background)
    BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
has told leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will
not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference in
early December, a senior party source said on Monday.
    Merkel, 64, has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up
the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as
chancellor. The euro <EUR=> fell to session lows on the news.
    German news agency DPA, citing sources, tweeted that Merkel
wanted to remain chancellor.
    Monday's developments come after the CDU came home first but
bled support in a vote in the western state of Hesse on Sunday,
the second electoral setback in as many weeks for Merkel's
conservative alliance.
    Standing down from the party chair would allow a new CDU
chairman or woman to build a profile before the next national
election, due in 2021. Merkel's favoured successor is CDU party
secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist
parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.

are now uniform entrance exams to university, irrespective of
the chosen field of study.
    High school students say the changes will increase the exam
burden and create a system which discourages critical thought.

 (Adds background, context)
    By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
told leaders of her conservatives on Monday that she will not
seek re-election as party chairwoman, senior party sources said,
heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated
European politics.
    Merkel, 64, has been chairwoman of her conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005.
Party sources said Merkel wants to remain chancellor until 2021,
when the next federal election is due.
    The announcement, which effectively accelerates the process
for the CDU to settle on and groom Merkel's successor, caused
the euro <EUR=> to fall briefly and German government bond
yields rose. [nL8N1X924N]
    Stepping down as CDU chairwoman would further undermine
Merkel's authority, which has already been dented this year by
two regional election setbacks and a close ally losing his role
as leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group.
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.
    ""We are witnessing a continuation of the pattern in place
ever since Merkel’s mistakes in the 2015 migration crisis: the
gradual but steady erosion of her political power,"" said Carsten
Nickel, managing director at Teneo, a consultancy.
    ""Rather than outright instability in Germany and Europe, it
simply means a continuation of the current leadership vacuum.""
    Monday's news came as a surprise to CDU party officials, who
had expected Merkel to seek re-election as chairwoman at a party
congress in Hamburg in early December. 
    The shock move started the race in the CDU to succeed
Merkel. It also raises questions about whether she can stage
manage a smooth exit. 
    Merkel is under pressure from her Social Democrat coalition
partners to deliver more policy results and the centre-left
party could yet pull out of the government at a mid-term review
next year. [nL8N1X804M]
    Germany's other leader CDU chancellors - Konrad Adenauer and
Helmut Kohl - both had messy ends to their time in office.
    
    SUCCESSION RACE
    Merkel standing down from the party chair would allow a new
CDU chairman or chairwoman to build a profile before the next
national election.
    Party sources said Merkel's favoured successor, CDU party
secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, had announced her
candidacy for the party chair.
    Party sources also said that Friedrich Merz, a former
parliamentary leader of Merkel's conservative alliance, was
ready to put himself forward for the CDU chairmanship.
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist
parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.
    When Merkel came into office in 2005, George W. Bush was
U.S. president, Jacques Chirac was in the Elysee Palace in Paris
and Tony Blair was British prime minister.
    Her decision comes on the heels of a second electoral
setback in as many weeks for Merkel's conservative alliance. In
a vote in the western state of Hesse on Sunday, the CDU came out
top but lost 11 percentage points in support compared to the
last election in 2013. [nL8N1X804M]
    ""With these latest results, it has simply become untenable
that Merkel continues to lead the CDU,"" said Mujtaba Rahman,
managing director at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/London-October 29: German life insurers will have more 
freedom in their asset allocation as a result of reduced requirements to build 
ZZR reserves (""Zinszusatzreserve""), following reform that became law on 22 
October, Fitch Ratings says. This will help life insurers to allocate assets 
more in line with customers' risk/return appetite, mitigating the decline in 
sales of savings products with long-term investment guarantees. In recent years, 
a combination of low interest rates and onerous ZZR requirements has severely 
constrained investment freedom. 

The ZZR reform is in line with our expectations and is credit-positive for 
Fitch-rated insurers. It alleviates pressure on their business models and gives 
them more flexibility to strike a balance between a defensive balance sheet and 
offering products that are attractive to customers. Low interest rates and 
onerous ZZR requirements had shifted the focus to the former at the expense of 
the latter, with many insurers no longer offering traditional saving products 
with long-term investment guarantees, and several putting their portfolios into 
run-off.

From a credit perspective, the benefit of the reform is partly offset by the 
fact that insurers will not be ratcheting up their reserves as much as under the 
previous requirements. However, the German life insurers that we rate have 
strong balance sheets and are well capitalised, and their ratings are not 
predicated on significant ZZR additions.

German life insurers are required to build up a ZZR as a buffer to help meet 
long-term investment guarantees to customers if interest rates remain low. 
Counterintuitively, the requirement has become more onerous as interest rates 
have started to rise. This is because the ZZR is calculated with a reference 
interest rate that is still falling, as it is based on rates over the past 10 
years and therefore lags market interest rates. Insurers were therefore facing 
rising ZZR requirements at the same time as rising interest rates were starting 
to erode unrealised gains on their assets.

The ZZR reform introduces a new calculation method, which leads to an end-2018 
reference rate of 2.09%, compared with 1.88% under the previous method. The 
German Insurance Association estimates that this will mean a significantly lower 
ZZR cost for the sector this year (EUR5 billion instead of EUR20 billion). The 
new method will also mean a significantly lower peak accumulation of ZZR 
(estimated at EUR77 billion instead of EUR134 billion), with less drag on sector 
earnings in the next few years as insurers build ZZR to the lower peak. However, 
the lower ZZR will mean less scope for ZZR releases to emerge and support future 
earnings.

The ZZR reform was driven by the expectation that interest rates will continue 
to rise. If they do, this will, in itself, be positive for the German life 
insurance sector. Higher rates would help insurers to meet investment guarantees 
on existing contracts, and to offer them on new contracts, while maintaining 
their capital positions. However, interest rates are still low by historical 
standards and we expect traditional saving business to remain under pressure, 
with more portfolios likely to be placed into run-off. About EUR130 billion of 
Germany's EUR1 trillion life sector is in run-off, and we think this could grow 
to EUR180 billion by 2022, with run-off specialists managing an increasing 
share.

    ISTANBUL, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Turkey called on Monday for the
full truth surrounding the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal
Khashoggi to be revealed, as Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor
held talks in Istanbul.
    Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul nearly
four weeks ago has escalated into a crisis for the world's top
oil exporter, which initially denied any knowledge of or role in
his death.
    Saudi public prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb arrived in Istanbul
overnight, days after he contradicted weeks of Saudi statements
by saying that Khashoggi's killing was premeditated. On Monday
he met Istanbul's chief prosecutor.
    ""The whole truth must be revealed,"" Turkey's Foreign
Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference. ""We believe
this visit is important for these truths to come out.""
    Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of Saudi
Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was
killed inside the consulate after he went there to get documents
for his forthcoming marriage.
    Saudi officials initially insisted that Khashoggi left the
compound on Oct. 2 after completing his paperwork. Turkish
officials, however, said they believed he was killed inside by a
team sent from Saudi Arabia.  
    Riyadh's numerous shifting accounts of the killing have
undermined Prince Mohammed's standing in the West.
    Cavusoglu called on Riyadh to conclude the investigation as
soon as possible.
    Turkey's state broadcaster TRT Haber said Saudi officials at
Monday's meeting asked for the whole investigation folder,
including evidence, statements and footage, be given to them.
TRT said the Saudi request was denied.
    Turkish prosecutors at the meeting, which lasted slightly
over an hour, repeated Ankara's request that 18 suspects be
brought to Turkey and that the location of Khashoggi's body be
revealed, it said.
    Turkey's Anadolu news agency said Mojeb was expected to
inspect the Saudi consulate.
    Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has expressed scepticism
about Saudi's changing explanations of the killing and has
called on the kingdom to hold to account all those responsible,
no matter how highly placed. [nL8N1X339E]
    The suspects Turkey wants extradited include a 15-man
security team that it says flew in hours before the killing and
carried it out. Erdogan said on Saturday the extradition request
was being relayed to Saudi Arabia.
    Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said those behind the
killing would be prosecuted in the kingdom. [nD5N1X200D]
    Turkey has said it shared information regarding the
investigation with other countries, including the United States,
Germany, France and Russia.

    By Swaha Pattanaik
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Angela Merkel has
called time on her own tenure. The politician who has been
Germany’s chancellor for 13 years has decided to not seek
re-election as chairwoman of her party, the Christian Democrats
(CDU). While she nevertheless wants to serve her full term as
chancellor until 2021, her country and the rest of Europe will
inevitably start looking ahead to what could be a more
polarising era.
    The announcement of Merkel’s decision to give up the CDU
chair came on Monday, a day after a regional election in the
western state of Hesse saw support for the conservatives slump
by 11 percentage points. Nor was that an aberration. The
Christian Democrats’ sister party, the CSU, two weeks ago
suffered its worst result in Bavaria since 1950. Some
traditional supporters of the two parties were angered by
Merkel’s 2015 decision to welcome one million mainly Muslim
asylum seekers. The need to win back such voters may tempt the
next chair of the CDU to push the party to the right.
    But that will be hard to square with the demands of Merkel’s
junior coalition partner, the left-leaning Social Democrats
(SPD) who are also being punished by voters. The SPD’s share of
the Hesse vote fell to roughly a fifth, the worst result in the
state since 1946, and the party is under pressure to show
supporters it is achieving tangible results by staying in
government. If the CDU tacks to the right, and the SPD pulls the
other way, the current coalition will fall apart sooner rather
than later. A minority government or an alliance with the
liberal Free Democrats, who walked away from coalition talks
last year, could then be on the cards. 
    There will also be consequences for the rest of Europe if
the CDU lists to the right. A lame-duck Merkel – or her
successor – may be less tolerant of countries, such as Italy,
who flout the European Union’s budget rules. All the more so if
the CDU is trying to win back its traditional supporters, who
typically favour fiscal discipline. Merkel may be remembered for
her ability to forge consensus and act for the greater good.
Domestic political pressure means her successor is unlikely to
have that luxury.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her
Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as
party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior
party source said on Oct. 29.
    - Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up
the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as
chancellor.
    - The Christian Democrats were first in an election held on
Oct. 28 in the western state of Hesse but support for the party
fell by more than 11 points. The centre-left Social Democrats
(SPD), who are Merkel’s junior coalition partner, won about a
fifth of the vote, their worst result in the western state since
1946.

    By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said on Monday she would not seek re-election as party
chairwoman and that her fourth term as chancellor would be her
last, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has
dominated European politics.
    Merkel, 64, has been chairwoman of her conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005.
Her decision to step down as chairwoman comes after her party
suffered its second regional election setback in as many weeks.
    Merkel made the announcement on the day after Sunday's vote
in Hesse in a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of the German
Federal Government Commission for Culture and the Media (BKM).
    The move sets in motion the process for the CDU to settle on
and groom Merkel's successor. It caused the euro <EUR=> to fall
briefly and German government bond yields rose. [nL8N1X924N] 
    Stepping down as CDU chairwoman further undermines Merkel's
authority, which has been dented this year by the two regional
election setbacks and a close ally losing his role as leader of
her conservatives' parliamentary group.
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.
    ""We are witnessing a continuation of the pattern in place
ever since Merkel’s mistakes in the 2015 migration crisis: the
gradual but steady erosion of her political power,"" said Carsten
Nickel, managing director at Teneo, a consultancy.
    ""Rather than outright instability in Germany and Europe, it
simply means a continuation of the current leadership vacuum.""
    Monday's news came as a surprise to CDU party officials, who
had expected Merkel to seek re-election as chairwoman at a party
congress in Hamburg in early December. 
    The shock move started the race in the CDU to succeed
Merkel. It also raises questions about whether she can stage
manage a smooth exit. 
    Merkel is under pressure from her Social Democrat coalition
partners to deliver more policy results and the centre-left
party could yet pull out of the government at a mid-term review
next year. [nL8N1X804M]
    Germany's other leader CDU chancellors - Konrad Adenauer and
Helmut Kohl - both had messy ends to their time in office.
    
    SUCCESSION RACE
    Merkel standing down from the party chair will allow a new
CDU chairman or chairwoman to build a profile before the next
national election.
    Party sources said Merkel's favoured successor, CDU party
secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Friedrich Merz, a
former parliamentary leader of Merkel's conservative alliance,
and Health Minister Jens Spahn had announced their candidacies
for the party chair.
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist
parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.
    When Merkel came into office in 2005, George W. Bush was
U.S. president, Jacques Chirac was in the Elysee Palace in Paris
and Tony Blair was British prime minister.
    In a vote in the western state of Hesse on Sunday, the CDU
came out top but lost 11 percentage points in support compared
to the last election in 2013. [nL8N1X804M]
    ""With these latest results, it has simply become untenable
that Merkel continues to lead the CDU,"" said Mujtaba Rahman,
managing director at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Paris-October 29: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Robert Bosch GmbH's 
(Bosch) Short-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'F1' and short-term debt 
issued by Bosch and Robert Bosch Finance Corp at 'F1'.

The rating of Bosch reflects its strong business profile, exemplified by its 
large size, leading positions in its key markets, sound diversification and a 
solid track record of innovation, coupled with a strong financial profile. It 
has robust key credit metrics, stable cash flows, excellent financial 
flexibility and a conservative financial policy.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Global Leader: Bosch's large scale and top-ranking global positions in the 
group's core product fields are strongly positive credit factors. The group is 
the world-largest automotive supplier with leading positions in numerous 
sub-segments of the auto-supply industry. In addition, Bosch is a major global 
player in consumer goods as well as in industrial and energy technologies with 
strong positions in residential heating, portable electric power tools and 
household appliances. Bosch also benefits from strong brand awareness with 
end-customers. Bosch is one of the few Fitch-rated auto suppliers with 
significant direct customer relationships, and a brand name widely recognised by 
consumers.

Sound End-Market Diversification: Bosch benefits from healthy end-market 
diversification. We believe that Bosch offers the broadest and a more diverse 
portfolio of products among Fitch-rated peers. Bosch serves a global customer 
base with a broad and diversified exposure to all major automotive 
manufacturers. The group also benefits from strong business diversification 
provided by its exposure to the less volatile power tools and housing appliances 
markets as well as by its exposure to a large variety of industrial sectors. 
Inherent cyclicality in automotive supply operations is further mitigated by 
Bosch's exposure to the less cyclical automotive aftermarkets.

Solid Growth Prospects: We view Bosch as solidly positioned for all the major 
changing trends reshaping the automotive sector with recognised expertise on 
fast growing auto supply segments linked to fuel efficiency, vehicle 
electrification, automation and connectivity. Bosch is also well-positioned in 
the growing field of connected goods, infrastructure and building. We also 
believe that the group's broad business portfolio is an advantage. Bosch can 
offer solutions for the whole ecosystem from in-car technologies through 
software platform, smart infrastructure and data collection, processing and 
storage.

Innovation Leader: Among Fitch-rated auto suppliers Bosch has the highest level 
of RD in both percentage of sales and absolute terms, which supports our growth 
expectations. These resources support Bosch's leading edge in advanced 
driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and technologies related to reducing vehicle 
emissions. We believe that the group's RD efforts will allow Bosch to manage 
uncertainties around powertrain technologies and to withstand intensified 
challenges from high-technology firms, such as Samsung Electronics Co. 
(AA-/Stable), Google and Intel Corporation (A+/F1/Stable).

Profitability Improving but Remains Weak: EBIT and funds from operations (FFO) 
margins have improved significantly over 2017 reaching 7.2% from 5.7% in 2016 
and 10% from 9% in 2016, respectively, but remain below our expectations for the 
rating. We forecast EBIT and funds from operations (FFO) margins to be broadly 
stable over the medium-term. Profitability improvements will be constrained by 
continuously high upfront investment in RD and high start-up costs for new 
projects in the Mobility Solutions business sector and by fiercer competition in 
household appliances in the Consumer Goods business sector. These are expected 
to offset positive margin developments in the Industrial Technology and Energy  
Building Technology business sectors on the back of cost reduction programmes 
and sales initiatives. We also expect free cash flow (FCF) margin to reach 2.5% 
by 2021, up from 1.5% in 2017, as increasing FFO will more than offset higher 
capex and dividends.

Low Gross and Net Leverage: Bosch has low FFO-adjusted gross leverage and the 
lowest FFO-adjusted net leverage among Fitch-rated auto suppliers. We expect 
Bosch to remain in a net cash position and FFO gross leverage to decline toward 
1.0x by end-2020 from 1.2x in 2017. The improvement is expected to be driven by 
improving FFO generation and positive FCF generation, which will partly be used 
to reduce outstanding gross debt. This is despite our expectations that Bosch 
will deploy further cash toward acquisitions.

Conservative Financial Policy: Earnings retention is an important source of 
financing, in line with the group's conservative financial policy underpinned by 
substantial liquidity. Bosch is 92%-owned by a foundation, which safeguards its 
independence. The remaining shares are held by the Bosch family and as treasury 
stock. Under the ownership of the foundation, the requirement for shareholder 
returns is low, meaning that earnings can be focused on internal development of 
the business, and that Bosch is able to maintain a very strong capital 
structure.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

Bosch has the strongest business profile and financial structure among 
Fitch-rated auto suppliers, which offsets its weaker profitability. The group's 
large scale, top-ranking global positions and solid RD capability in the group's 
core product fields are strongly positive credit factors. Bosch benefits from 
stronger business diversification than peers, such as BorgWarner, Inc. 
(BBB+/F2/Stable) and Continental AG (BBB+/F2/Stable). However, Bosch has weaker 
operating and cash-flow margins than the highest-rated auto-suppliers in our 
rated universe, such as Continental AG and Borgwarner, Inc. This is offset by 
Bosch's solid financial structure with the lowest FFO adjusted net leverage 
among Fitch-rated auto suppliers. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or 
operating environment aspects impact the rating.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer

- Revenue to grow in low single digits in 2018 and around 4% each year over 
2019-2021

- EBIT margin to remain broadly stable at 7.2%

- Average capex intensity of 6.9% over 2018-2021

- Aggregate working capital outflows of EUR3 billion

- Net cash spend on acquisitions of EUR3.2 billion by 2021. Major acquisitions 
will be treated on a case-by-case

- Disposal of the packaging machinery business has not been incorporated

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive 
Rating Action

- An upgrade to 'F1+' is unlikely as the group has reached what is viewed by 
Fitch the natural ceiling of the sector.

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative 
Rating Action

- EBIT margin sustainably below 6%

- A material weakening in the group's liquidity profile, including sustained 
negative FCF margin

- FFO-adjusted net leverage increasing above 1x

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

Ample Liquidity: Liquidity remains healthy, including EUR9.7 billion of readily 
available cash, after Fitch's adjustments for minimum operational cash of EUR1.9 
billion and less liquid marketable securities of EUR4.9 billion. Liquidity is 
further supported by our expectation of positive FCF generation. Bosch's 
maturities are well-spread with some bonds extending as far out as 2039. For its 
short-term financial needs, the group has also access to unused EUR1 billion and 
USD2 billion commercial paper programmes.

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS 

Fitch assumes that the income/expense from the disposal of non-current assets, 
income/expense from the reversal/recognition of provisions, profit from entities 
consolidated using the equity method and earnings impact of higher depreciation  
amortisation from the re-measurement of assets are non-operating items.

    By Shreyashi   Sanyal
    Oct 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to bounce back on
Monday from a steep sell-off last week, helped by gains in auto
stocks, signs of a recovery in high-growth companies and relief
over an unchanged rating on Italy.  
    Wall Street was rocked this month by jitters over
geopolitical events as well as fears over tariffs, rising wages
and borrowing costs. The Dow and the S&P 500 returned to
negative territory for the year on Friday.    
    Relief over Italy dodging a ratings downgrade helped U.S.
stock futures reverse a decline after data showed China's
industrial profit growth slowed for fifth straight month in
September, pointing to cooling domestic demand in the world's
second-biggest economy.
    The five high-growth FAANG stocks- Facebook Inc <FB.O>,
Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, Netflix Inc <NFLX.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O>,
Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> were up between 1.4 percent and 2.25
percent in premarket trading.      
    ""News on Europe doing better and a tailwind with the large
M&A deal, we have a market that is a bit easier to head into,""
said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New
York. 
    The slowdown in China, a major source of income for several
American companies, has been a major concern this earnings
season, with a slew of corporates from industrials to chipmakers
giving discouraging forecasts.
    While healthy third-quarter results have pushed up
third-quarter profit estimates at S&P companies to 25.2 percent
from 21.8 percent in the past 10 days, dour forecast have pulled
down the current-quarter's growth outlook to 19.5 percent from
19.9 percent, according to Refinitiv data.
    Carmaker Ford Motor Co <F.N> rose 4.5 percent, while General
Motors Co <GM.N> gained 4.6 percent after Bloomberg reported
China was planning to cut the tax levied on car purchases by
half. [nL3N1X940G]
    ""Investors are coming in today from an oversold market last
week,"" Hogan said. ""Markets are set to have a positive reaction
to any form of good news.""
    At 9:10 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 150 points, or
0.61 percent. S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> were up 27 points, or 1.01
percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> were up 80 points, or 1.16
percent.
    Futures held on to their gains as U.S. consumer spending for
September rose in line with expectations and income recorded its
smallest gain in more than a year, suggesting a moderation in
spending in the future. [nUSNTLEEMX]
    Shares of IBM Corp <IBM.N> fell 4.7 percent, the most among
S&P 500 components before the opening bell, after the company
agreed to buy software company Red Hat Inc <RHT.N> for $34
billion. Red Hat shares soared 49.1 percent. [nL2N1X80A4]    
    Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> rose 2.6 percent as the Times reported
that the electric carmaker's third largest shareholder, Baillie
Gifford & Co, would be willing to inject more cash in the
company. Another report said German luxury carmaker Daimler AG
<DAIGn.DE> does not rule out cooperating with Tesla in the
future. [nL8N1X9293] [nL3N1X93YO]

 (Adds Merkel quotes)
    By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said on Monday she would not seek re-election as party
chairwoman and that her fourth term as chancellor would be her
last, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has
dominated European politics.
    Merkel, 64, has been chairwoman of her conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005.
Her decision to step down as chairwoman comes after her party
suffered its second regional election setback in as many weeks.
    Merkel made the announcement a day after Sunday's vote in
the state of Hesse, at which the CDU came first but suffered a
slump in support from the last election there in 2013.
    ""I have the firm feeling that today the time has come to
open a new chapter,"" Merkel, looking serious but calm, told
reporters in Berlin after a meeting of the CDU's leadership.
    Drawing the consequences of the CDU's weak result in Hesse
and dissatifaction with her coalition, she said: ""Firstly, at
the next CDU party congress in December in Hamburg, I will not
put myself forward again as candidate for the CDU chair.""
    ""Secondly, this fourth term is my last as German chancellor.
At the federal election in 2021, I will not stand,"" she added.
    The move sets in motion the process for the CDU to settle on
and groom Merkel's successor. It caused the euro <EUR=> to fall
briefly and German government bond yields rose. [nL8N1X924N] 
    Stepping down as CDU chairwoman further undermines Merkel's
authority, as she had previously said the party chair and
chancellery should be held by the same person.
    Her authority has already been dented this year by the two
regional election setbacks and a close ally losing his role as
leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group.
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.
    ""We are witnessing a continuation of the pattern in place
ever since Merkel’s mistakes in the 2015 migration crisis: the
gradual but steady erosion of her political power,"" said Carsten
Nickel, managing director at Teneo, a consultancy.
    ""Rather than outright instability in Germany and Europe, it
simply means a continuation of the current leadership vacuum.""
    Monday's news came as a surprise to CDU party officials, who
had expected Merkel to seek re-election as chairwoman at a party
congress in Hamburg in early December. 
    The shock move started the race in the CDU to succeed
Merkel. It also raises questions about whether she can stage
manage a smooth exit. 
    Merkel is under pressure from her Social Democrat coalition
partners to deliver more policy results and the centre-left
party could yet pull out of the government at a mid-term review
next year. [nL8N1X804M]
    Germany's other leading CDU chancellors - Konrad Adenauer
and Helmut Kohl - both had messy ends to their time in office.
    
    SUCCESSION RACE
    Merkel standing down from the party chair will allow a new
CDU chairman or chairwoman to build a profile before the next
national election.
    Merkel said CDU party Secretary General Annegret
Kramp-Karrenbauer and Health Minister Jens Spahn - a leading
critic of the chancellor - had announced they would seek the
party chair. Party sources said Friedrich Merz, a former
parliamentary leader of Merkel's conservative alliance, would
also run.
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist
parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.
    When Merkel came into office in 2005, George W. Bush was
U.S. president, Jacques Chirac was in the Elysee Palace in Paris
and Tony Blair was British prime minister.
    In Sunday's vote in Hesse, the CDU came out top but lost 11
percentage points in support from the last election in 2013.
[nL8N1X804M]
    ""With these latest results, it has simply become untenable
that Merkel continues to lead the CDU,"" said Mujtaba Rahman,
managing director at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.

 (Adds statement by international observers)
    By Margarita Antidze
    TBILISI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Georgia's ruling party failed to
secure the presidency in a single round of voting when its
candidate barely beat her main challenger and fell far short of
a majority, forcing a runoff, results showed on Monday.
    The ruling Georgian Dream party had long predicted that its
candidate Salome Zurabishvili, a former French career diplomat
who took Georgian citizenship to serve as foreign minister from
2004-2005, would win the vote outright in Sunday's first round.
    But final results on Monday showed her with just 38.7
percent of the vote, one percentage point ahead of the candidate
of the main opposition alliance, Grigol Vashadze, another former
foreign minister.
    The third-place candidate, David Bakradze, who received
nearly 11 percent of the vote, announced he would support
Vashadze in the second round, a boost to the opposition which
includes supporters of former President Mikheil Saakashvili. 
    Although constitutional changes have reduced the authority
of the president in favour of a stronger prime minister, the
result is a setback for Georgian Dream and its founder,
billionaire banker Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia's richest man.
    International observers said on Monday that the election had
been competitive, but had been held on ""an unlevel playing
field"" with state resources misused, private media biased, and
some phoney candidates taking part. [nR4N1X400J]
    Although the presidency has been weakened, it is still seen
as an important post for the country's image abroad.
    Georgia strives to cultivate close ties with the West to
counterbalance Russia, which invaded a decade ago and has
recognised the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions.
Moscow looms large over its domestic politics as well, with the 
main political factions frequently accusing each other of
failing to stand up to Russian influence.
    The country of 3.7 million people is Washington's strategic
ally in the Caucasus region and hopes eventually to join the EU
and NATO. Pipelines carrying Caspian oil and gas to Europe run
across its territory.     
    Zurabishvili, 66, was born to Georgian emigre parents in
France and served as French ambassador to Georgia before
becoming Georgia's foreign minister in 2004. She aims to become
the first female leader of a former Soviet state apart from the
EU-member Baltics.
    Her supporters say she would bring international stature to
the presidency. But her opponents have criticised her for
statements that appeared to blame Georgia for war with Russia in
2008 and remarks about minorities that some saw as xenophobic.
    Her rival Vashadze, 60, a diplomat and businessman, served
as Georgia's foreign minister from 2008-2012. He secured the
backing of a coalition of opposition groups led by former
president Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM).

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Paris/London-October 29: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Groupama 
Assurances Mutuelles's (Groupama) and core subsidiaries' Insurer Financial 
Strength (IFS) Ratings at 'A-' ('Strong') and Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 
'BBB+'. The Outlooks are Positive. A full list of rating actions is available at 
the end of the commentary.  

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The affirmation reflects Groupama's strong capitalisation, low investment risk 
and a very strong franchise in the French insurance sector. Offsetting these 
rating strengths is Groupama's low profitability relative to the group's 'A' 
rating category.

The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that Groupama will maintain 
strong capitalisation and leverage in 2018, as measured by sustained stability 
in Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Model (Prism FBM) score and a financial leverage 
ratio (FLR) remaining commensurate with a 'A' rating category.

Groupama scored 'Strong' on Fitch's Prism FBM, based on 2017 combined results. 
This was supported by lower-risk capital, reflecting Groupama's reduced exposure 
to risky assets, and higher available capital. 

Fitch expects the Prism score to remain at least 'Strong' at end-2018, driven by 
retained earnings, additional hybrid debt, and a gradual increase in the 
proportion of unit-linked products in the life portfolio that may partially be 
offset by lower asset valuations. Groupama has also been strengthening its 
capital by issuing 'certificats mutualistes' (mutual insurance certificates), 
which are similar to ordinary shares and developed specifically for mutual 
companies in France. Mutual insurance certificates are treated as unrestricted 
Tier 1 capital for Solvency II purposes.

Groupama reported a Solvency II capital ratio of 167% at end-June 2018, 
excluding transitional measures, down from 174% at end-2017, as market spread 
widening and volatility increased solvency capital requirements. This score is 
broadly in line with regional peers of comparable size. With the inclusion of 
transitional measures, the regulatory ratio was 298% (315% at end-2017). The 
ratio is sensitive to changes in market interest rates.

Fitch estimates Groupama's financial leverage ratio (FLR) to have risen to 30% 
at end-September 2018 from 26% as at end-2017, after the EUR 500 million debt 
Tier 2 issue earlier this month (for more details, see "" Fitch Rates Groupama's 
EUR500m Dated Subordinated Euro Notes 'BBB-'"" dated 18 September 2018 at 
www.fitchratings.com. The ratio nevertheless remains within Fitch's benchmark 
range of 24%-31% for the 'A' rating category. Fitch's central scenario is for 
Groupama to call its EUR500 million of outstanding Tier 2 debt in October 2019, 
returning the FLR to a pre-issue level of around 25%. 

Fitch expects Groupama to report stable, but weak, profitability. Operational 
result as calculated by Groupama rose to EUR217 million at end-June 2018 
(end-June 2017: EUR154 million), driven by stronger margins both in life and in 
non-life. Net income (EUR206 million) fell yoy, in the absence of exceptional 
profits from disposals. Fixed-charge coverage of around 3x in 2017 remains weak 
relative to the group's rating. 

Groupama has completed the de-risking of its investment portfolio. The risky 
asset-to-equity ratio further improved to 83% at end-2017 from 102% at end-2016. 
Fitch expects the ratio to remain well below 100% in 2018 as the company 
reinvests in risky assets opportunistically. Fitch notes, however, that 
Groupama's presence in Italy (8% of gross written premium (GWP) at end-June 
2018) results in Italian sovereign bonds (BBB / Negative) representing 14% of 
the group's fixed income portfolio at end-June 2018 (approximately 100% of 
shareholder's funds as calculated by Fitch ). 

Groupama has a very strong franchise in the French insurance sector, where the 
group is the largest agricultural insurer. In addition, the group holds an 
important market position in property and motor insurance, and is also a key 
participant in the health and protection market in France. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The ratings could be upgraded if Groupama maintains its 2017 capitalisation and 
earnings results. This would be evidenced by a Prism FBM score of at least 
'Strong', a FLR at around 25%, and strong non-life profitability as measured by 
a combined ratio of below 100% and a group return of equity of at least 4% 
(2017: 4%).

The ratings could be downgraded if the Prism score falls to 'Adequate'. A 
significant weakening of financial leverage, as reflected in the FLR rising to 
above 32%, could also result in a downgrade.

If the new Insurance Rating criteria proposed by Fitch are implemented, we do 
not expect Groupama's ratings to be affected.

conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it 
in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification 
of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are

factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and

work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial

and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or

obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000

    By Tom Miles
    GENEVA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The United States urged European
Union governments on Monday to reflect on whether it was really
in their interest for the EU to go ahead with a trade dispute
over U.S. metals tariffs, and said it was hopeful of settling
the issue with Mexico and Canada.
    U.S. Ambassador Dennis Shea told the WTO's monthly dispute
settlement meeting, which was considering 12 requests for
adjudication over U.S. tariffs and related retaliation, that
Washington was ""deeply disappointed"" with the EU's stance. 
    ""We would encourage the European countries to consider
carefully their broader economic, political, and security
interests,"" Shea said, according to a transcript of his remarks
seen by Reuters.
    But another U.S. trade official later told the same meeting
that the United States had held constructive discussions on the
tariffs with Canada and Mexico, the transcript showed.
    ""The United States is hopeful these discussions may be
concluded satisfactorily,"" the official said.
    China, Norway, Russia and Turkey had also asked the WTO to
judge the legality of the U.S. tariffs, despite Washington's
claim that they are based on national security and therefore
outside WTO jurisdiction. [nL8N1WZ3IZ]
    ""We will not allow China’s Party-State to fatally undermine
the U.S. steel and aluminum industries, on which the U.S.
military, and by extension global security, rely,"" Shea said.
    National security claims were taboo for most of the WTO's
23-year history, because trade diplomats feared a domino effect
as countries cited national security to get out of a wide range
of obligations. But Shea suggested it would be even worse to try
to challenge the U.S. national security claim. 
    ""The United States wishes to be clear: if the WTO were to
undertake to review an invocation of (the national security
exemption), this would undermine the legitimacy of the WTO’s
dispute settlement system and even the viability of the WTO as a
whole,"" he said.

    By Shreyashi   Sanyal
    Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Monday, as
gains in auto stocks, a recovery in tech company stocks and
relief over an unchanged sovereign rating on Italy helped a
rebound from last week's steep global selloff.
    Carmaker Ford Motor Co <F.N> rose 6.2 percent, while General
Motors Co <GM.N> gained 4.5 percent after Bloomberg reported
China was planning to cut the tax levied on car purchases by
half. [nL3N1X940G]
    All of the 11 major S&P sectors were in positive territory
with technology <.SPLRCT> up 1.9 percent, gaining the most,
followed by the communication services <.SPLRCL> sector, which
rose about 2 percent. 
    The two sectors house four of the five high-growth FAANG
stocks. Facebook Inc <FB.O>, Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, Netflix Inc
<NFLX.O> and Alphabet GOOGL.O were up between 1.2 percent and
2.2 percent. Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, part of consumer
discretionary <.SPLRCD> and another stock hit heavily by
unusually shaky tech results last week, was trading flat.
    Wall Street has been rocked by jitters over geopolitical
events as well as fears over tariffs, rising wages and borrowing
costs, putting the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> on track for its
worst monthly performance since May 2010. 
    ""Investors are coming in today from an oversold market last
week,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR
in New York. ""Markets are set to have a positive reaction to any
form of good news.""   
    Relief over Italy dodging a ratings downgrade helped global
sentiment and overturned an earlier fall in U.S. stock futures
due to data showing China's industrial profit growth slowed for
a fifth straight month in September.
    The slowdown in China, a major source of income for several
American companies, has been a concern this earnings season,
with a slew of corporates from industrials to chipmakers giving
discouraging forecasts.
    While healthy third-quarter results have pushed up
third-quarter profit estimates at S&P companies to 25.2 percent
from 21.8 percent in the past 10 days, dour forecast have pulled
down the current-quarter's growth outlook to 19.5 percent from
19.9 percent, according to Refinitiv data.
    At 10:08 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was
up 340.01 points, or 1.38 percent, at 25,028.32, the S&P 500
<.SPX> was up 1.6 percent at and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC>
was up 122.49 points, or 1.71 percent, at 7,289.71.
    Also offering support was data that showed U.S. consumer
spending for September rising in line with expectations and
income recording its smallest gain in more than a year,
suggesting a moderation in spending in the future. [nUSNTLEEMX]
    Shares of IBM Corp <IBM.N> fell nearly 2 percent after the
company agreed to buy software company Red Hat Inc <RHT.N> for
$34 billion. Red Hat shares soared 47 percent. [nL2N1X80A4]
    Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> rose 2.5 percent as the Times reported
that the electric carmaker's third largest shareholder, Baillie
Gifford & Co, would be willing to inject more cash in the
company. [nL3N1X93YO]

whether Belgian banks paid out interest and dividends on
accounts frozen under U.N. sanctions in 2011 as the Libyan state
under Muammar Gaddafi collapsed, public broadcaster RTBF said on
Monday.
    Prosecutors, the government and Belgian banks did not
comment on the report, which cited an unidentified source. 
    RTBF said that up to 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) could
have been disbursed to people controlling Libyan accounts,
including militia groups in the country accused of human rights
abuses.
    RTBF said that when the United Nations agreed to freeze
deposits held by Gaddafi's administration abroad, Belgium had
done so but had not halted payments of interest and dividends.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Thousands of passengers at
Brussels Airport suffered a fifth day of flight cancellations as
baggage handlers and management of Aviapartner failed to resolve
a dispute over working conditions.
    Brussels Airport said that 130 of a total of 630 planned
flights had been cancelled, bringing the total of cancellations
since Thursday evening to 660, a spokeswoman said.
    Unions and management of Aviapartner broke off talks on
Sunday evening, but were due to meet again on Monday. The
baggage handlers are complaining that they are under too much
pressure at work because of a shortage of staff.
    The strike, which had not been called by unions in advance,
was set to continue until at least Tuesday morning.
    Aviapartner deals with baggage for 29 airlines in and out of
Brussels Airport, including Ryanair <RYA.I> and KLM <AIRF.PA>.
It does not have an impact on Belgium's main carrier, Brussels
Airlines, which uses a different operator to handle luggage.

    MILAN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The board of Italy's state-owned
railway operator will meet on Monday afternoon to discuss an
offer for the whole of national carrier Alitalia, a source close
to the matter said.
    Any offer by railway group Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) will be
subject to series of conditions, including finding an industrial
partner, the source said.
    Once a major player in the European airline industry,
Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] has suffered in the face of competition
from high-speed trains and low-cost carriers in recent years,
eroding its market share and denting its profits.   
    The airline was put under special administration last year
and the government has since been looking for a buyer.
    A new ruling coalition, comprising the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, has said the sale
would be finalised by the end of this month.
    Last week it said there was interest from many private
investors, although it gave no names. [nS8N1RT01Q]  
   The sale process, initially due to be closed by April, was
postponed because of elections in March.
    FS presented a non-binding expression of interest for the
airline this month, giving it access to the group's books. 
    Last month FS Chief Executive Gianfranco Battisti said there
would be many synergies between the two companies, including
ticketing and routes. 
    FS declined to comment.

    By Ulf Laessing
    TUNIS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A woman in her 30s blew herself up
in the centre of the Tunisian capital Tunis on Monday, wounding
nine people including eight police in what the Interior Ministry
called a ""terrorist explosion"".
    Witnesses described a blast on the central Habib Bourguiba
avenue where hundreds of police were cordoning off an area near
the capital's landmark Municipal Theatre and the French embassy.
    ""I was in front of the theatre and heard a huge explosion,""
witness Mohamed Ekbal bin Rajib told Reuters.
    Ambulances could be heard rushing to the scene.
    Shops were shut on the avenue, usually one of the busiest
streets in the capital and site of protests that toppled
long-serving leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali at the start of the
2011 ""Arab Spring"" of regional revolts.
    Tunisia, which is heavily dependent on tourism, has improved
security since a series of militant attacks targeting tourists
caused the near collapse of the sector three years ago.
    In 2015, 21 people were killed during a hostage siege in its
national museum, the Bardo in Tunis, and a gunman killed 38
people on a resort beach. The following year, militants tried to
capture the town of Ben Guerdane near the Libyan border.
    There have been no attacks on that scale since then, but the
economy has remained troubled and the authorities worry about
militants who shelter in neighbouring Libya.
    Tunisia is one of the few Arab democracies, and the only
country to throw off a long-serving autocrat during the Arab
Spring without triggering large scale unrest or civil war.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 29: Fitch Ratings has assigned BlackRock European 
CLO VII Designated Activity Company expected ratings as follows:

EUR240 million Class A: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR28 million Class B-1: 'AA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR20 million Class B-2: 'AA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR7 million Class C-1: 'A(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR20 million Class C-2: 'A(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR23 million Class D: 'BBB-(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable 

EUR22 million Class E: 'BB(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR12 million Class F: 'B-(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable

EUR39.25 million subordinated notes: 'NR(EXP)sf'

The assignment of final ratings is contingent on the receipt of final documents 
conforming to information already reviewed.

The transaction is a cash flow collateralised loan obligation (CLO). Net 
proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used to purchase a portfolio 
with a target par of EUR400 million. The portfolio is primarily made up of 
European senior secured loans (at least 96%) with a component of senior 
unsecured, mezzanine, and second-lien loans.

The portfolio is actively managed by BlackRock Investment Management (UK) 
Limited. The CLO envisages a 4.6-year reinvestment period (scheduled to end on 
15 July 2023) and an 8.5-year weighted average life (WAL).

KEY RATING DRIVERS

'B' Portfolio Credit Quality

Fitch expects the average credit quality of obligors to be in the 'B' category. 
The weighted average rating factor (WARF) of the identified portfolio is 31.0, 
below the covenanted maximum of 33.0.

High Recovery Expectations

At least 96% of the portfolio comprises senior secured obligations. Recovery 
prospects for these assets are typically more favourable than for second-lien, 
unsecured and mezzanine assets. The weighted average recovery rating (WARR) of 
the identified portfolio is 64.3%, above the covenanted minimum of 63.0%.

Diversified Asset Portfolio 

The covenanted maximum exposure to the top 10 obligors for assigning the 
expected ratings is 23% of the portfolio balance. The transaction also includes 
various concentration limits, including the maximum exposure to the three 
largest (Fitch-defined) industries in the portfolio at 40%. These covenants 
ensure that the asset portfolio will not be exposed to excessive concentration.

Adverse Selection and Portfolio Management

The transaction features a 4.6-year reinvestment period and includes 
reinvestment criteria similar to other European transactions. Fitch's analysis 
is based on a stressed-case portfolio with the aim of testing the robustness of 
the transaction structure against its covenants and portfolio guidelines.

Limited Interest-Rate Risk

Up to 12.5% of the portfolio can be invested in fixed-rate assets, while 
fixed-rate liabilities represent 10% of the target par. This fixed-rate bucket 
covenant partially mitigates interest rate risk. Fitch modelled both 0% and 
12.5% fixed-rate buckets and found that the rated notes can withstand the 
interest rate mismatch associated with each scenario.

Cash Flow Analysis

Fitch used a customised proprietary cash flow model to replicate the principal 
and interest waterfalls and the various structural features of the transaction, 
and to assess their effectiveness, including the structural protection provided 
by excess spread diverted through the par value and interest coverage tests.

No Unhedged Non-Euro Exposure

The transaction is permitted to invest up to 20% of the portfolio in non-euro 
assets, provided perfect swaps are entered into as of the settlement date for 
each of them.

Different Waterfall Structure

The transaction has a slightly different interest waterfall structure than the 
market standard  waterfall.  Deferred interest is paid after the coverage tests 
have been met. Fitch has tested the impact of this feature and found the impact 
on the notes to be negligible.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

A 25% default multiplier applied to the portfolio's mean default rate, and with 
this increase added to all rating default levels, would lead to a downgrade of 
up to two notches for the rated notes. A 25% reduction in recovery rates would 
lead to a downgrade of up to four notches for the rated notes.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO RULE 17G-10 

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action. 

DATA ADEQUACY

The majority of the underlying assets have ratings or credit opinions from Fitch 
and/or other Nationally Recognised Statistical Rating Organisations and/or 
European Securities and Markets Authority-registered rating agencies. Fitch has 
relied on the practices of the relevant groups within Fitch and/or other rating 
agencies to assess the asset portfolio information.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable. 

SOURCES OF INFORMATION

The information below was used in the analysis. 

-Loan-by-loan data provided by the arranger as at 10 October 2018

-Capital structure provided by the arranger as at 22 October 2018 

-Draft offering circular provided by the arranger as at 26 October 2018 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate 
to the underlying asset pool was not prepared for this transaction. Offering 
documents for EMEA CLO transactions do not typically include RW&Es that are 
available to investors and that relate to the asset pool underlying the 
security. Therefore, Fitch credit reports for EMEA CLO transactions will not 
typically include descriptions of RW&Es. For further information, see Fitch's 
Special Report titled ""Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
Global Structured Finance Transactions,"" dated 31 May 2016.

    * Party leader says cannot accept ""weakness"" within 5-Star
    * Attention switches to high-speed Italo-French rail link

    By Crispian Balmer
    ROME, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi
Di Maio called on Monday for unity within his 5-Star Movement
after the anti-establishment party was forced to renege on an
electoral pledge to halt a major, international gas transport
project.
    Former party sympathisers set fire to the 5-Star flag in the
southern Italian town of Melendugno on Sunday to protest at the
government's decision to endorse the Trans Adriatic Pipeline
(TAP) that will bring Azeri gas into Italy via their coastline.
    Ahead of elections in March, 5-Star promised to abandon the
project if it took power, but after months of deliberations, Di
Maio acknowledged at the weekend that the pipeline would have to
go ahead. He said Italy would face penalties of 20 billion euros
 ($23 billion) if it pulled out at this late stage.
    Facing ridicule and criticism on social media, Di Maio said
the party was under attack, both from inside and out, and urged
5-Star supporters to close ranks in the same way ancient Roman
soldiers locked their shields together to keep out enemy arrows.
    ""Today, in our army, some people are showing signs of
weakness ... We cannot allow ourselves such weakness,"" Di Maio
wrote on the party website. 
    ""The slightest failure on any front means that all the land
we have conquered will return to being no-man's land."" 
    The 5-Star formed a coalition with the far-right League in
June and is battling against the restraints of government, which
sometimes clash with its anti-establishment roots.
    Besides giving way on the TAP, Di Maio has also had to
ignore party objections to keeping the giant Ilva steelworks
open [nL5N1VS2KE]. He is also having to back a tax amnesty which
was endorsed by the League but is anathema to his own
supporters.
    
    HIGH-SPEED ANXIETY
    Di Maio said he only found out how much it would cost to
cancel TAP after he had taken office and gained access to
official documents. Ministers from the former government denied
his version of events and said all documentation was public. 
    ""They are lying,"" ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi said.
    ""5-Star promised to block (TAP) within two weeks (of taking
office) ...They won votes on the back of this promise. After six
months they changed their mind. We lost the election, Italy has
lost time. Di Maio has lost face,"" Renzi said in a statement.
    With TAP and Ilva moving ahead, attention is switching to
another major project that 5-Star has always opposed and that is
under consideration - a high-speed rail link known as TAV that
is meant to connect Turin with the French city of Lyon.
    Infrastructure Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is a member of
5-Star, called timeout on the project in June, saying he wanted
a cost-benefit analysis of the 270-km (167-mile) line.
[nL5N1UK6TF]
    The Turin newspaper La Stampa quoted Di Maio on Monday as
warning the League that his party would implode if TAV went
ahead. 
    However, the League supports the link, which involves
building a 57-km tunnel under the Alps, arguing that it will
strengthen big business in the League's northern heartlands.
    ""I hope the government, having given the green light to the
so-called TAP in Puglia, will not offer up the Turin-Lyon line
and other major projects in the north as a sacrificial lamb to
make up to (5-Star) voters,"" said Sergio Chiamparino, a League
politician, who heads the Piedmont region centred on Turin.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A whistleblower who helped to
reveal a major money laundering scandal at Danske Bank
<DANSKE.CO> has been freed of confidentiality obligations to the
company ahead of his testimony in the European Parliament next
month.
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015,
many of which Denmark's largest bank said in a report last month
it regards as suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Howard Wilkinson, a British trader in Danske Bank's Estonia
branch until 2014, is scheduled to testify at public hearings in
Copenhagen on Nov. 19, and in Brussels on Nov. 21. [nL8N1X40YU]
    ""We have released the person in question of all contractual
duties of confidentiality in relation to Danske Bank,"" a Danske
spokesman said in a statement.
    ""We have previously sent a legal statement to the
(whistleblower) giving our permission to talk to the relevant
supervisory authorities in Denmark and Estonia, and have
encouraged the person in question to,"" the spokesman said.
    It is crucial that Wilkinson be freed of any non-disclosure
agreements following his tenure at Danske Bank so that he can
speak freely, Jeppe Kofod, a spokesman for the European
Parliament committee that is arranging the Brussels hearing,
told Reuters last week.
    The scandal has led the bank's former chief executive Thomas
Borgen to resign and almost halved Danske Bank share price since
February.
    The bank's interim CEO, Jesper Nielsen, will represent the
bank in the hearings in the Danish and European Parliament, the
Danske statement said.

    * Czech crown resists on central bank rate hike expectation

 (Adds deepened currency losses, new comments from market
participants)
    By Sandor Peto and Alicja Ptak
    BUDAPEST/WARSAW, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The zloty led a
weakening of Central European currencies on Monday as the euro
was also hit by uncertainty over German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's hold on her office.
    Merkel told leaders of her Christian Democrats that she will
not seek re-election as party chairwoman in December and that
her fourth term as chancellor would be her last. [nL8N1X926U]
    Germany is the European Union's biggest economy and a key
trading and investment partner for its eastern members.
    The region's most liquid currency, the zloty <EURPLN=>, shed
0.3 percent against the euro by 1359 GMT, while the forint eased
by 0.2 percent.
    ""Germany is causing a region-wide weakening,"" one
Budapest-based currency dealer said, adding that he did not see
much downside in the forint however.
    End-of-month positioning may contribute to the zloty
weakness, but technical analysis shows that it is unlikely to
depreciate much further, said Mateusz Bieniek, chief dealer at
Santander Bank in Poland.
    The Czech crown <EURCZK=> gave up early gains, trading at
25.855, or 0.1 percent weaker from Friday.
    Although it was outperforming the zloty and the forint, it
was still near its weakest levels since July, even though the
Czech central bank has raised rates at its past three meetings,
taking the main two-week repo rate to 1.50 percent <CZCBIR=ECI>.
    It is widely expected to raise rates further at its meeting
on Thursday to support the crown and fight inflation.
[nS8N1PH030]
    Central Europe's stock exchanges shrugged off the reports on
Merkel, with Warsaw's <.WIG20> and Prague's <.PX> main indices
rebounding from multi-month lows as Western European shares also
regained ground.
    Europe's auto stocks index <.SXAP> jumped after a report
said China's regulator was planning to halve its car purchase
tax. [nL8N1X92LH]
    In Prague, a 2.6 percent gain by state-controlled utility
CEZ <CEZP.PR> was a key driver of the main stock index's 2.1
percent rise.
    The Czech government may delay its decision on building new
reactors at CEZ's <CEZP.PR> two nuclear power plants, Industry
Minister Marta Novakova was quoted as saying on Monday. 
    Some minority CEZ shareholders are afraid that such an
expensive project might dent dividend payouts. [nL8N1X92Q7]
    In the region's government bond markets, Poland's 10-year
paper <PL10YT=RR>, boosted by a strong auction on Friday, traded
at its lowest yield since August early in the session, but later
rose to 3.14 percent, tracking a rise in Bund yields <DE10YT=RR>
after the reports on Merkel.
    ""What we can see right now is a small correction. In the
future the yields should drowsily rise,"" said Mateusz Sutowicz,
a financial markets analyst at Bank Millennium.

largest listed bank, posted higher third quarter profits that
met market forecasts, as a relatively strong performance at its
international services unit offset weakness at its investment
banking and retail bank arms.
    Third quarter net profit rose 4 percent from last year to
2.12 billion euros ($2.41 billion). Analysts surveyed by
Financial Inquiry expected a profit of 2.11 billion.
    Overall, group revenues dipped 0.4 percent to 10.35 billion
euros, below the 10.61 billion euros expected by analysts.
    Revenues at BNP Paribas' retail banks in France, Belgium and
Italy remained weak as a result of persistently low interest
rates, while revenue from its corporate and investment banking
(CIB) unit fell again due to an adverse trading environment. 
    BNP Paribas' international financial services arm, which has
been its growth engine in past quarters and includes consumer
lending and U.S. and emerging market retail banks, slowed down
in the third quarter mainly due to the depreciation of the
Turkish lira.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EARNINGS DOMINATE, STOXX 600 SEEKS FLOOR (0819 GMT)
    European shares are off to steady start today with STOXX 600 <.STOXX> inching up 0.3 percent
but staying below yesterday's peak, suggesting that equity markets are still looking for a floor
after this month's ugly sell-off sent them near two-year lows.
    The focus today is on corporate updates with earnings driving the big price changes. In the
snapshot, you can see the top movers on the STOXX 600.
    Qiagen <QIA.DE> raised its 2018 earnings target, sending its shares up more than 9 percent,
while Jyske Bank <JYSK.CO> and Geberit are being hit hard following disappointing trading
updates.
    Among the top movers are also Reckitt <RB.L> (down 4.6 percent), Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> (down 5
percent) and Volkswagen <VOWG.DE> (up 4.7 percent), BP <BP.L> (up 3.7 percent) and BNP Paribas

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: ""GREAT DEAL"" COMMENTS SOOTHE INVESTORS, EARNINGS FLOW IN (0734 GMT)
    European stocks are set to rise for a second day, with futures up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across
euro zone benchmarks, while FTSE 100 futures were down 0.1 percent.
    A report the U.S. intends to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports in December failing
progress in talks between Trump and Xi Jinping weighed on stocks in the U.S. and Asia, but
Trump’s claim he expects a “great deal” with China, in a Fox News interview, helped risk
appetite improve.
    Results from BNP Paribas would do nothing to quell investors’ concerns about European banks.
France’s largest listed bank said weakness at its corporate and investment banking arm and at
European retail banks drove revenue down – a 5 percent miss against expectations, analysts said.
    Spain’s BBVA reported in-line results thanks to extraordinary capital gains in Chile
offsetting a loss of 190 million euros due to hyperinflation in China. 
    UK gambling stocks Paddy Power Betfair and GVC could gain after the UK finance minister
announced a lower remote gaming duty tax than expected, according to Credit Suisse and Davy
Research analysts. 
    Some of the now-familiar themes of this earnings season – rising costs and concerns about
construction - were evidenced once again. 
    Swiss plumbing firm Geberit lowered its sales outlook, flagging extra caution about the
building industry. German airline Lufthansa blamed higher fuel costs for its Q3 profit miss –
the latest in the airline sector to do so. 
    On the other side of the scale, BP profits hit a five-year high as the oil major benefited
from higher crude prices. 
    In the autos sector – which soared up as much as 4.8 percent on Monday on a report China was
mulling halving its car purchase tax, but closed 2.9 percent higher as some enthusiasm faded –
Volkswagen became the latest to report weaker vehicle sales and more stringent anti-pollution
rules dented its profit.

    EARNINGS ROUND-UP: RISING COSTS A RECURRING THEME (0646 GMT)
    Recurring themes in the results so far this morning, with Lufthansa warning of higher fuel
costs and plumbing company Geberit giving a cautious outlook for the building sector.
    Banks may shine again after HSBC's surprisingly strong results yesterday, with BNP Paribas
and BBVA reporting increases in profit. BP will publish results later.

    EUROPE TO OPEN LOWER AS TRADE WAR HEATS UP AGAIN (0629 GMT)   
    European stocks are set to slip at the open after the U.S.-China trade war ramped up again
following a Bloomberg report that the U.S. is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining
Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail.
[nL2N1X9232]
    Asia shares recouped early losses and crept higher on Tuesday as China made a fresh attempt
to stabilise its stock markets, but the gains looked fragile amid fears of a sharp escalation in
the U.S.-China trade war. [nL3N1XA26D]
    In another development in the trade war which is being fought not only over goods but also
intellectual property (IP), President Donald Trump's administration took action on Monday to cut
off a Chinese state-backed chipmaker from U.S. suppliers amid allegations the firm stole IP from
U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology Inc <MU.O>. [nL2N1X919X]
    Plenty to look out for in the UK as well this morning with most of the market-moving

    Airlines could be hurt after the government announced Air Passenger Duty would be frozen for
short-haul flights but would rise in line with inflation for long-haul. [nL8N1X9695]
    And gambling companies could be bruised by an increase in the ""Remote Gaming Duty"" - taxes
paid by offshore gambling companies. [nL8N1X95QE]
    Spreadbetters IG see the FTSE opening 16 points lower at 7,011, Frankfurt's DAX opening 4

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds yields
dipped for a second day in a row on Tuesday towards one-month
lows before a key auction of bonds, while Germany was expected
to announce its highest inflation figure in seven years. 
    Buoyed by S&P Global's decision not to downgrade Italy's
credit rating on Friday, the country's borrowing costs dipped
another 1-3 basis points across the curve. 
    The move is particularly striking as it comes before an up
to 4.5 billion euro auction of five-year and 10-year bonds -
normally, yields rise before an auction as investors make room
for the new supply. 
    ""I think after this move we can expect a positive outcome in
the auction - Italy has already managed to get auctions through
in much worse scenarios this year,"" DZ Bank rates strategist
Daniel Lenz said. 
    With the day's rally, Italy's 10-year bond yield <IT10YT=RR>
is now at 3.32 percent, 10 basis points below Friday's close and
the closely-watched spread over Germany is at 293 basis points,
close to its tightest level in three weeks. <DE10IT10=RR> 
    The five-year Italian yield <IT5YT=RR> was 2.5 bps lower at
2.57 percent, close to a one-month low. 
    However, analysts warned of potential volatility later this
week, with Italian lawmakers expected to vote on a contentious
budget draft that has put the country at odds with Brussels. 
    ""It looks like there will be no changes to the first draft,
no sign of a compromise, so this could be bad news for the
market,"" said Lenz of DZ Bank. 
    
    INFLATION PRESSURE
    Other euro zone bond yields edged higher before the release
of German inflation data for the month of September, which is
expected to be at 2.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll. DZ
Bank reckons this would make it the biggest rise in consumer
prices in the bloc's largest economy in seven years.  
    Long term euro zone inflation expectations this week dipped
to its lowest in a year at 1.659 percent, according to a key
market gauge, the five-year five-year forward inflation swap
<EUIL5YF5Y=R>, but this data could give inflation bets a boost. 
    It could also mean that the ECB is moving towards its
targeted inflation of just below 2 percent for the euro zone,
which could put upward pressure on bond yields. 
    German 10-year government bond yields, the benchmark for the
bloc, were 1.5 bps higher at 0.395 percent. <DE10YT=RR> 
    They had already risen three bps on Monday - moving away
from seven-week lows - after German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said that her fourth term as chancellor would be her last and
that she would step down as leader of the Christian Democrats.
[nL8N1X926U]
    The German state of Saxony recorded above-expectations
inflation of 2.5 percent for the month of October on Tuesday.
[nB4N1W4025]
    Other German state inflation data will filter through ahead
of the countrywide figure, which will be released at 1300 GMT.

    Oct 30 (Reuters) - Spanish retail sales posted their
sharpest fall in five years in September, data showed on
Tuesday, indicating a softening in the pace of economic growth
is feeding through to consumers.
    The euro zone's fourth-largest economy has been growing
faster than most of its peers in the bloc since it emerged from
a near five-year slump in the second half of 2013.
    But slowing exports and rising global trade uncertainty have
prompted the government to trim 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts.
[nL8N1WV3EU]
    Retail sales fell by 0.9 percent from a year earlier on a
calendar-adjusted basis, after rising a revised 0.1 percent in
August, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said.
    September's fall was the biggest since August 2013, at the
height of the crisis, when the indicator slumped 5.7 percent. 
    The August figure was revised down from a preliminary
reading of a rise of 0.3 percent, INE said.

    * Q3 GDP 0.0 pct q/q, +0.8 pct y/y, below forecast
    * Zero contribution to GDP from trade and internal demand

ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Italy's economy ground to a halt in the third quarter, data showed on Tuesday, as both domestic demand and trade flows failed to spur any growth.
    Gross domestic product was unchanged between July and September, following a 0.2 percent rise in the second quarter, and was up 0.8 percent on an annual basis, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
    That lagged an average forecast of a 0.1 percent rise quarter-on-quarter, up 0.9 percent year-on-year in a Reuters survey of 28 analysts.
    Growth in the euro zone's third largest economy has been slowing steadily since the start of 2017. 
    The flat quarterly reading in the third quarter was the weakest result since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
    This month the government, which took office in June, cut the official full-year 2018 forecast to 1.2 percent from a 1.5 percent projection made in April by the previous administration.
    Achieving even the revised target would require a marked acceleration in the fourth quarter.
    The new coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League has presented an expansionary 2019 budget it says is needed to boost growth and prevent Italy's chronically sluggish economy slipping into recession.
    However the budget, which targets the deficit to rise to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 from 1.8 percent this year, was rejected last week by the European Commission.
    The EU executive said Italy was flouting a previous commitment to lower the deficit steadily towards a balanced budget, and gave Rome three weeks to present a new budget. The  government says it has no intention of changing its plans.
    ISTAT made no revision to the second quarter, when GDP rose 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter and 1.2 percent year-on-year.
    ISTAT said that in the third quarter both trade flows and domestic demand had made neutral, or zero contribution to economic growth.
    It gave no numerical breakdown of components with its preliminary estimate, but said the services and agricultural sectors expanded while industry was a drag on growth.
    ISTAT said so-called called ""acquired growth"" at the end of the third quarter stood at 1.0 percent. 
    This means that even if GDP were to be flat quarter-on-quarter in the last three months, over the whole of 2018 it would still be up 1.0 percent from 2017.
    The government has forecast growth will accelerate to 1.5 percent next year thanks to increased investment, tax cuts and a new income support scheme it says can boost consumer spending. The EU Commission says the growth forecast is too optimistic. 
    
    ISTAT gave the following details:  

    
                                  Q3 2018   Q2 2018    Q1 2018

    TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire
Insurance Co Ltd plans to increase its foreign bond holdings,
mainly floating rate dollar bonds, senior investment planning
officials said on Tuesday.
    The firm, which is the main unit of Tokio Marine Holdings
<8766.T>, plans to maintain full currency hedging on its foreign
debt investment, officials said.
    ""Comparatively speaking, our focus will be on U.S. floating
rate bonds,"" Masahiro Tajima, manager of asset allocation at
Tokio Marine, told Reuters in an interview.
    ""Fundamentally, we're focusing on investing in the United
States, and we'll consider investing in Europe while making sure
of the situation regarding Brexit and Italy.""
    The company mainly focused on investing in U.S.
dollar-denominated credit products such as corporate bonds and
loans in the six months to September, officials said.
    Most of Japan's largest private life insurers said in recent
weeks they plan to buy more foreign bonds in the second half of
the current fiscal year.
    But high currency hedging costs have stifled their demand
for U.S. Treasuries, while high currency hedging costs have also
prompted a move towards unhedged foreign bonds.

 (Adds analyst, background)
    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Germany's jobless total fell in
October and employment hit a record high in September, data
showed on Tuesday, underlining the strength of a labour market
that is supporting a consumer-led upswing in Europe's largest
economy.
    The Federal Labour Office said the seasonally adjusted
jobless total fell by 11,000 to 2.292 million, slightly below
the predicted drop of 12,000.
    The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1 percent, the
lowest since German reunification in 1990.
    ""Thanks to the continuing boom, the labour market is still
in good shape...,"" KfW economist Joerg Zeuner said.
    ""In some sectors, however, shortages of skilled workers and
young recruits are hampering the expansion of production. The
care sector and the building trade are particularly affected.""
    In a politically risky push to fill a record number of job
vacancies and stabilise the public pension system, Chancellor
Angela Merkel's coalition parties earlier this month agreed on a
new immigration law to attract more skilled workers from
countries outside the European Union. [nL8N1WI1US]
    In a further positive sign, seasonally adjusted employment
as measured by the International Labour Organisation climbed by
557,000 on the year to a record of 45.0 million in September,
separate Federal Statistics Office data showed.
    Household spending has become an important growth driver in
Germany as record-high employment, increased job security,
above-inflation pay hikes and low borrowing costs all help open
shoppers' wallets.
    A survey last week showed that German shoppers look keen to
spend in November, but their expectations for the economy and
their own personal income have slipped on worries about
international trade conflicts and Brexit. [nB4N1W401S]

accelerated in the first nine months of 2018, rising 4.9 percent
year-on-year compared with 4.7 percent in the same period of
2017, preliminary data showed on Tuesday.
    Growth in September alone was 5.6 percent year-on-year, up
from  2 percent in August and from 5 percent a year earlier. The
highest growth in September was registered in the processing
industry, financial sector, trade, transport and real estate
operations.
    The former Soviet republic hosts pipelines carrying Caspian
oil and gas to Europe. Georgia is recovering from a decline in
exports and a plunge in the currencies of its main trading
partners, which have depressed economic growth in recent years.
    In 2017 it recorded growth of 5 percent as exports recovered
and remittances from abroad rose. The fastest growing sectors
were the processing industry, services and real estate.
     The government expects growth of 4.5 percent in 2018
overall.
    Fitch Ratings may upgrade Georgia's sovereign credit rating
if the country maintains strong economic growth and
macroeconomic stability and further improves its finances, the
agency's analyst told Reuters in September.
    Fitch reaffirmed Georgia's long-term foreign currency rating
at ""BB-"" with a positive outlook in August.

ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) -  Morale among Italian businesses fell in October but consumers were more upbeat, data showed on Tuesday, as Italy remains locked in a dispute with the European Commission over its expansionary 2019 budget.
     National statistics institute ISTAT's manufacturing confidence index slipped to 104.9 in October from 105.6 in September, coming in broadly in line with the median forecast of 104.8 in a Reuters survey of seven analysts.
    ISTAT's composite business morale index, combining surveys of the manufacturing, retail, construction and services sectors, fell more steeply to 102.6 from 103.6 to register its lowest level since December 2016.
    However, consumer confidence rose in October to 116.6 from 116.1 the month before, far above the forecast in Reuters' survey which pointed to a fall to 115.0.
    Gross domestic product in the euro zone's third largest economy stagnated in the third quarter, data showed earlier on Tuesday, posting its weakest reading since the fourth quarter of 2014. [nR1N1W500K] 
    The ruling coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League has presented an expansionary 2019 budget it says is needed to boost growth and prevent Italy's chronically sluggish economy slipping into recession.
    However the budget, which targets the deficit to rise to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 from 1.8 percent this year, was rejected last week by the European Commission because it breaks EU rules on fiscal consolidation.
    The EU executive gave Rome three weeks to present a new budget, but the government says it has no intention of changing its plans. 
       
    ISTAT gave the following data on the October manufacturing confidence survey:

populous regions accelerated in October to reach the highest
level in many years, data showed on Tuesday, adding weight to
the European Central Bank's case for gradually winding down its
unprecedented monetary stimulus.
    With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last
week confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying
programme at the end of this year and raise interest rates for
the first time since 2011 sometime after next summer.
[nL8N1X56JH]
    The ECB's goal is to keep inflation in the euro zone close
to, but just below, two percent a year.
    Annual inflation in Germany's most populous state, North
Rhine-Westphalia, picked up to 2.4 percent in October from 2.3
percent in the previous month, preliminary regional statistics
office data showed.
    This was the highest reading since October, 2011.
    In Bavaria, the second-most populous state, and in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the third, annual inflation accelerated to
2.8 percent after 2.5 percent in the previous month.
    The state inflation readings, which are not harmonised to
compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide
data due at 1300 GMT.
    A poll conducted before the release of the regional data
suggested that Germany's harmonised consumer price inflation
(HICP) rate would pick up to 2.4 percent in October from 2.2
percent in the previous month.
    This would be the highest reading since February, 2012.
    The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data for
October on Wednesday, with the headline figure expected to pick
up to 2.2 percent after 2.1 percent in September, according to a
Reuters poll.

    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - France’s largest
lender reported a dip in revenue as its international and fixed
income dealing businesses disappointed. That is more worrying
than a weak quarter in retail banking, which may be temporary.
The bank will only hit a revenue target by firing on all
cylinders.

10.6 billion expected by analysts. Net income rose to 2.1
billion euro in the three months to the end of September, up 4

    - The bank’s operating costs rose 2 percent from a year
earlier as it spent more in technological overhauls.

    By Francesco Guarascio and Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew less
than expected in the third quarter as the public mood turned
darker, with signs of distress in Italy highlighting concerns
that the bloc's third-ranked state is becoming one of its
weakest links.
    Tuesday's data, suggesting the slowdown has further to run,
will make uncomfortable reading for the European Central Bank as
it moves towards ending in December the programme of asset
purchases it introduced in 2015 to boost inflation and economic
growth.
    Economists said the quarterly growth dip to 0.2 percent from
0.4 percent in the second quarter was unlikely to change those
plans, though it might push back the date of the ECB's first
post-stimulus hike in interest rates.
    ""We expect the ECB to stick to its plans to end asset
purchases this year, but the recent run of weak data suggests
that the bank will stress that policy tightening will depend on
the incoming figures,"" Jessica Hinds, economist at Capital
Economics, said.
    Tuesday's preliminary flash GDP reading from European
statistics office Eurostat, which sent the euro <EUR=> to an
intraday low against the dollar, was worse than expected.
    Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent rise
in the 19 countries sharing the euro. The 0.2 percent reported
was the lowest growth pace in more than four years.
    Eurostat does not provide national data in its flash
estimates, but figures from Italy's statistics agency ISTAT
showed growth there stagnated in the third quarter, as the
government pursues a war of words with Brussels over a 2019
budget draft that breaks EU rules. [nR1N1W500K]
    ""With budget discussions already tense between Rome and
Brussels, this stagnation will only add to concerns,"" Bert
Colijn, economist at ING, said.
    Quarterly growth in France, the bloc's second biggest
economy, also missed forecasts at 0.4 percent though growth
accelerated, data from the INSEE statistics agency showed on
Tuesday [nL8N1XA22F].
    An estimate for Germany, the bloc's largest economy, is not
yet available but economists foresee growth is likely to have
slowed there too, although the country's jobless total fell in
October and employment hit a record high in
September[nL8N1XA2UI].
    Meanwhile, inflation in Germany's most populous regions
accelerated in October to well above 2 percent, reaching the
highest level in many years.
    That compares with an ECB target of close to but below 2
percent, though Tuesday's German data was not harmonised to
compare with other euro zone countries and did not strip out
volatile elements such as oil prices, which have risen sharply
in recent months. [nL8N1XA2FO]
    That suggests price pressures will not be a major factor in
shifting ECB decisions at this stage. 
        
    CONFIDENCE ON THE SLIDE
    Of more concern to policymakers in Frankfurt will be
indications that the bloc's economic slowdown could worsen in
the final quarter.
    The European Commission said on Tuesday that euro zone
economic sentiment dropped in October for the tenth consecutive
month. 
    The indicator of managers' and consumers' morale - which
rose steadily in 2017 - fell to 109.8 points from 110.9 in
September, its biggest dip since March though still above its
long-term average.
    In October the largest fall was recorded in retail services
as managers held ""much grimmer views on the present and expected
business situation,"" the Commission said, and the indicator of
selling price expectations dropped.
    Confidence in industry and services also went down, while
consumer sentiment improved slightly.
    Morale fell in Germany, France and Italy while it grew in
Spain.
    In Italy the downward trend began in July, the month after a
eurosceptic government took office in Rome.
    Outside the euro zone, Britain recorded a slight increase of
economic sentiment, driven up by more optimism in retail trade
and services which more than offset a fall in industry
confidence.

    By Aimee Donnellan
    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - BNP Paribas
<BNPP.PA> was hit on several fronts in the third quarter.
France’s largest lender on Tuesday reported a dip in revenue,
with a disappointing performance at its international and fixed
income dealing businesses. That is more worrying than a weak
quarter in retail banking, which is likely to be temporary. The
bank will only hit its revenue targets by firing on all
cylinders. 
    Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé is targeting annual
revenue growth of at least 2.5 percent by 2020. While he still
has time to get there, the bank will have performed better than
it did in the third quarter. Overall revenue fell 0.4 percent
from a year earlier to 10.4 billion euros, while that of the
investment banking division fell 8.3 percent. The closely
watched fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) unit
reported an even sharper fall of 15.1 percent over the same
period – the business’s worst quarter since 2013, according to
Jefferies analysts, and weaker than most of its U.S. peers. Even
more worrying was a slowdown in BNP’s international financial
services business, which has traditionally been the engine of
growth for some time.  The unit only managed a 4.3 percent
increase in revenue in the third quarter, half the pace reported
in the second. 
    True, the retail bank will probably bounce back in the
coming quarter given the French economy and consumers are in
fair health. But the bank’s excuses, notably record low interest
rates, are starting to wear thin. If BNP is relying on a
dramatic reversal in the European Central Bank’s accommodative
monetary policy to meet revenue targets, shareholders are likely
to be disappointed. And when policy rates eventually do rise,
clients will be less prone to borrowing opportunistically at low
rates, which will be a drag on investment banking revenue.
Bonnafé’s best bet is to change what he can, rather than carp
about what is beyond his power.

    By Jamie McGeever
    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street's nine-year bull run
may be on its last legs - raising fears of a widening bear
market mirroring the length of the historic upswing as 20
percent-plus reversals grip large swathes of the global equities
universe. 
    If a prolonged equity funk feeds back into the real economy
via cowed business sentiment, reduced corporate spending and
investment, the threat of a deeper global economic downturn and
even recession mounts.
    So far, so cyclical. For many, it's long overdue.
    The big question, and arguably the bigger worry, is just how
much monetary and fiscal policymakers can cushion the fall. 
    Investors are starting to realize they may be at a turning
point. A Morgan Stanley client survey of over 100 portfolio
managers and chief investment officers shows 80 percent of them
cautious or bearish, and only 20 percent optimistic or bullish.
    The survey notes a ""psyche shift"" that wasn't there in
February, when a sudden burst of market volatility triggered a
12 pct slide on Wall Street. Then, there was ""strong"" buying of
the dips as clients added heavily to their long positions. Now,
they are far more inclined to sell into any rally. 
    ""It's becoming clear after investor feedback and market
action that sentiment has taken a significantly bearish turn,""
Morgan Stanley notes. 
    BlackRock notes that stocks and earnings growth are already
decoupling globally, and that's before the widely anticipated
slowdown in earnings growth next year.
    
    
    Analysts at Goldman Sachs point out that last week marked
the first time since 1990 that the S&P 500 fell 13 days in a
three-week period. The magnitude of the losses may not be on a
par with the dotcom collapse or 2008, but the frequency is
""dramatic"" and should ring alarm bells.
    The S&P 500 has lost nearly 10 percent in October, its worst
month since February 2009. It did plummet 12 percent in just two
weeks between Jan. 26 and Feb. 9 this year, but the scope for
recovery now is much narrower.
    
    
    
    POLICY PARALYSIS?
    The Fed's ability to control longer-term borrowing costs is
diminished. All else equal, a deluge of new Treasury debt sales
to fund the government's $1.5 trillion of tax cuts and increased
military spending puts a natural floor under yields.
    The U.S. budget deficit for fiscal year 2018 was $779
billion, the widest since 2012, and will approach $1 trillion
next year. This is a ""serious issue"" given that the deficit is
ballooning at a time of pretty decent growth, the Bipartisan
Policy Center warns.
    Trump's fiscal stimulus may have given the economy a shot in
the arm this year, but that will soon wear off. Current U.S.
growth of 3.5 percent will probably slow towards 2 percent by
the end of next year, and the odds on a recession by 2020 are
shortening.
    Any prospect of additional fiscal stimulus will be severely
curtailed if the Democrats win control of the House of
Representatives in next month's mid-term elections. Gridlock in
Washington will see to that.
    Just as U.S. government borrowing is set to reach $1.34
trillion in 2018 - more than double the previous year - the Fed
is shrinking its balance sheet. Quantitative easing has given
way to quantitative tightening, and interest rates are rising.
    The scope for adequate growth-boosting policy responses
beyond U.S. shores is also narrowing. That won't guarantee an
equity bear market, but it does make buy-on-dip rallies more
difficult to come by.
    China's economy expanded at an annual 6.7 percent in the
third quarter. Growth has come in lower than that only once in
the last quarter of a century, and that was the 6.4 percent
chalked up in the Great Financial Crisis in the first quarter of
2009.
    Beijing has more than $3 trillion of foreign-currency
reserves it can use to kick-start the economy, it's easing
banks' credit restrictions, and has allowed the yuan to fall to
a 10-year low against the dollar. It is down some 10 percent
since March.
    But trade tensions are beginning to bite, and Europe is
feeling the pain too: euro zone growth slowed to a 0.2 percent 
quarterly rate in the third quarter, half the expected pace and
the lowest in over four years.
    Euro zone growth is rolling over at just the wrong time, as
the European Central Bank brings its 2.6 trillion-euro QE
programme to an end and lays the groundwork for higher interest
rates next year. Or will Mario Draghi and co blink?
    Some emerging-market economies are in a deep slowdown or
even recession, and many emerging-market stock indices are
already in bear market territory. But their central banks are
being forced to raise interest rates to prop up their
currencies.
    Take all that together, and the profit and earnings growth
outlook for Wall Street and beyond is challenging. Analysts at
Barclays estimate that U.S. earnings growth will fall to less
than 10 percent next year from over 20 percent this year, and
warn that an ""all-out"" U.S.-China trade war would reduce that by
a further 3 percent.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German annual inflation picked up
in October to reach its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years,
data showed on Tuesday, supporting European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi's case for gradually winding down his
unprecedented monetary stimulus.
    German consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable
with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by
2.4 percent year-on-year after an increase of 2.2 percent in the
previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
    That was the highest reading since February 2012 and in line
with market expectations. The ECB targets inflation of close to
but below 2 percent for the single-currency bloc as a whole.
    On a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation even hit
a 10-year high at 2.5 percent, the data showed.
    Price pressures picked up on a broad basis, suggesting that
the rise was also driven by core inflation and not only by the
more volatile energy and food components. Germany's preliminary
inflation data do not include a figure for core inflation.
[nAPN009200]
    With price pressures building in the euro zone, the ECB last
week confirmed its plan to end its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96
trillion) bond-buying programme at the end of this year and
raise interest rates for the first time since 2011 sometime
after next summer.
    The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data for
October on Wednesday, with the headline figure expected to pick
up to 2.2 percent after 2.1 percent in September.
    The inflation figures chimed with data released earlier on
Tuesday that showed Germany's jobless total fell in October and
employment hit a record high in September, underlining the
strength of a labour market that is supporting a consumer-led
upswing in Europe's largest economy. [nL8N1XA2UI]

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): Covered Bonds Surveillance Snapshot

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10048422

Fitch Ratings-London-October 30: Most covered bonds programmes we rate benefit 
from a large buffer between our breakeven overcollateralisation (OC) for a given 
rating and the OC we rely upon in our analysis, says Fitch Ratings. Also, the 
cover pools of residential mortgage programmes, which represent about 
three-quarters of Fitch-rated covered bonds, display stable weighted average 
current loan-to-value ratios (CLTV). This contributes to the stability of 
covered bonds ratings, in addition to the cushion against issuer downgrades, 
given the covered bonds exemption from bail-in in jurisdictions with a 
resolution framework and liquidity protection in the event of an issuer default.

Almost half of the programmes rated by Fitch on the international scale have an 
OC buffer of at least 100%. Fitch therefore monitors these programmes' ratings 
without updating its asset and cash flows model output, in the absence of other 
material changes. The CLTV of residential cover pools has not increased by more 
than 5% since the date of their last assessment for nearly all mortgage 
programmes. Fitch can therefore rely on its last asset model output if the 
programmes also have an OC buffer of at least 25%, in the absence other material 
changes. This is in line with the model application section of the agency's 
recently revised covered bonds rating criteria.

Fitch's quarterly publication of the Covered Bonds Surveillance Snapshot enables 
us to share with market participants key cover pool and covered bonds statistics 
provided by issuers and data derived from Fitch's analysis. From this release, 
our ""Covered Bonds Surveillance Snapshot - Excel File"" lists all covered bonds 
publicly rated by Fitch in a new worksheet, together with their ISIN code, 
amount and maturity date. In addition, we show under the ALM loss headline the 
non-credit loss components of Fitch's breakeven OC for the rating. The recent 
covered bonds rating criteria update replaced the former asset disposal loss and 
cash flow valuation components with the ALM loss. Finally, we are providing 
links to covered bonds related research published both on www.fitchratings.com 
and FitchConnect, so users can easily download reports from either platform.

We invite you to explore our 3Q18 Covered Bonds Surveillance Snapshot and the 
related Excel file, which can be accessed through the links in this commentary.

    BEIRUT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Lebanon's risk profile is rising
sharply and some of the central bank's tools are becoming less
effective, the World Bank said on Tuesday in its autumn Lebanon
Economic Monitor report. 
    In response, the central bank has beefed up its foreign
exchange reserves, lengthened the maturity of deposits and
limited available liquidity, the report said. 
    Almost six months since a parliamentary election in May,
Lebanon's politicians are yet to agree a unity government that
can get to work on badly needed economic reforms. Politicians
have warned of economic crisis unless a government is formed
soon. 
    The country has the world's third largest public debt-to-GDP
ratio, stagnant growth and what the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has said are increasing vulnerabilities in its financial
system.
    Reforms are needed to bring down twin deficits and reduce
reliance on central bank operations which the IMF has described
as unconventional. 
    ""Fiscal and electricity reforms are highlighted as
priorities,"" the report said. 
    The formation of a new government and a programme of reforms
would also likely unlock more than $11 billion worth of
infrastructure investment pledged at a donors' meeting in Paris
in April.

    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Sterling sank against the dollar
and euro on Tuesday as concern about Britain's departure from
the European Union led investors to largely ignore hopes of an
end to austerity raised by finance minister Philip Hammond.
    The pound has weakened 4 percent in October as traders fret
over the lack of progress in divorce talks on issues including
the Irish border, less than five months before Brexit.
    Hammond's budget on Monday offered a glimpse of higher
spending after a decade of cuts to public services. But he made
clear that this will hinge on London getting a trade agreement
with Brussels. [nL8N1X94Y1] 
    ""The market is certain that the British economy will only be
able to benefit from the attested end of austerity announced
yesterday if an orderly Brexit is achieved,"" said Esther Maria
Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
    ""An agreement does not seem to be any closer so there is
still the threat of a no-deal Brexit... And that is all that
matters for sterling at the moment.""
    On Wednesday the pound fell 0.4 percent <GBP=D3> versus a
broadly stronger dollar to $1.2729, its lowest since Aug. 17. It
also lost ground against an otherwise under-pressure euro,
falling to a one-month low of 89.28 pence. <EURGBP=D3> 
    A no-deal Brexit would be likely to tip Britain into a
recession that could last more than a year, credit ratings
agency Standard and Poor's said on Tuesday. [nS8N1US003] S&P
said its base case was still that London and Brussels would
agree a withdrawal deal.
    Sterling traders are turning their attention to the Bank of
England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday, when it is
expected to keep interest rates on hold and detail conditions
necessary for policy tightening.
    ""Were it not for Brexit, the BoE on Thursday would probably
be providing guidance on a rate hike, possibly in February given
the compelling evidence of rising wage growth,"" MUFG analysts
said in a note.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 30: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of 
Valletta's (BoV) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB' and Viability 
Rating (VR) at 'bbb'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at 
the end of this rating action commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS AND VR 

BoV's ratings reflects its systemic role in the domestic Maltese economy, in 
which it has well-established franchises in core banking business, but this also 
leads to high concentration risks, its satisfactory profitability being 
maintained through the cycle, and sound funding and liquidity. The ratings also 
take into account the bank's improving risk appetite and control frameworks, 
which should support further de-risking and better credit quality metrics, and 
strengthened capitalisation. However, the latter remains at risk from sizeable 
potential losses arising from pending legal claims, and is vulnerable to asset 
performance fluctuations given its domestic focus in a small economy. 

Fitch views positively management's intention to reshape the business model away 
from trust and custodian business segments and international customers with no 
economic substance in the country, which proved riskier. This move should reduce 
exposure to potential reputational and conduct risks. BoV benefits from strong 
national market shares of customer lending and deposits. However, its large 
exposure to a small and highly open economy with less developed financial 
markets limits the benefits of its competitive position, brings risk 
concentration and heightens vulnerability to changes in the operating 
environment.

Risk controls and governance have been improving, especially in some areas where 
Fitch deemed the bank to lag behind international peers. BoV has been 
implementing an increasing number of policies and monitoring tools to govern 
money laundering and financial crime risks, but the effectiveness of these 
initiatives is largely untested. The outcome of the litigation in the Deiulemar 
case, which arises from the bank's trust business in relation to a failed 
shipping company in 2009, exposes the bank to a potential claim of EUR363 
million. The latter is partly covered through a EUR70 million provision charged 
in the first six months of 2018. 

Fitch's base case is that the bank will be able to manage the impact, if this 
was to fully materialise, without compromising its capitalisation, thanks to 
internal capital generation and planned capital supportive initiatives, 
including implementing a no dividend-strategy, if necessary. In our assessment, 
we also assume that the timing of the case resolution is likely to be in the 
medium term, given the quite long justice times, providing some flexibility to 
implement measures if need be. At end-2017, BoV's transitional common equity 
Tier 1 (CET1) and total capital ratios were 16.1% and 19.4%, respectively, 
reasonably above regulatory minimums.

BoV is able to generate good revenues from its core banking activities despite 
the low interest rate environment, reflecting its strong pricing power in 
domestic business. Its leading domestic franchise also sustains strong 
commission income. Operating expenses are relatively high, in particular 
personnel and regulatory costs, but contained loan allowances have helped BoV 
maintain satisfactory operating profitability through the cycle.

BoV's asset quality is more variable to changes in the economic cycle than other 
more diversified international peers, given its large and concentrated exposure 
to the small Maltese economy. Concentration risk towards property lending and 
Maltese sovereign risk are reducing but we expect them to remain structurally 
high by international comparison. Good economic growth and more conservative 
underwriting standards and write-offs should result in an improved impaired loan 
ratio (4.3% at end-2017, although we expect this to be higher upon 
implementation of IFRS9, but within manageable levels).

The bank's funding and liquidity are a relative strength, in our view. The bank 
maintains a low loans/deposit ratio (around 43% at end-2017), supported by a 
stable domestic-focused deposit base and a large portfolio of unencumbered 
eligible assets (accounting for almost one quarter of its end-June 2018 total 
assets). Access to the wholesale markets is currently not necessary and remains 
otherwise largely untested. 

SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF)

The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that if the bank becomes non-viable, full 
support for senior creditors from the Maltese authorities is possible but cannot 
be relied upon. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the 
Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) for eurozone banks provide a framework for the 
resolution of banks that requires senior creditors to participate in losses, if 
necessary, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRS AND VR

BoV's ratings are primarily sensitive to a deterioration in the operating 
environment in Malta, as this could affect its asset quality, earnings and 
capitalisation. Material increased levels of risk concentration could also be 
rating negative. If for any reason Fitch understands that the risks arising from 
legal claims increase and result in operational losses, eroding the bank's 
capitalisation more than expected and/or bring funding and liquidity risks, it 
would likely downgrade the ratings.  

A longer track record of a tighter risk management framework, improving 
capitalisation and asset quality could be rating positive. However, we consider 
upside rating potential to be limited, given the small economy in which the bank 
operates and the resulting risk concentration levels.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR 

An upgrade of the SR and upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a 
positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support BoV. While not 
impossible, this is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view. 

The rating actions are as follows: 

Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable

Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2'

Viability Rating: affirmed at 'bbb'

Support Rating: affirmed at '5'

Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor'

 (Updates with German inflation number, comment)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds were hit
on Tuesday by data showing the country's economy flatlined in
the third quarter of the year, while a 5.5 billion euro auction
pushed yields even higher.
    Italy's economy ground to a halt in the third quarter, data
showed on Tuesday, as both domestic demand and trade flows
failed to spur any growth, while euro zone growth disappointed
for the same period. [nR1N1W500K] [nL8N1XA2WV]
    Yields on Italian government bonds were eight to 14 basis
points higher on the day.
    ""It's a surprisingly weak Italian GDP number, it kind of
puts an end to the expectations that the government has that
they can base their budget on their current growth projections,""
said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder. 
    ""It highlights how out of touch some of the assumptions of
the Italian government were on this backdrop.""             
    Italy's government assumes economic growth of 1.5 percent in
2019, higher than the 1.1 percent growth projected by the
European Commission. 
    Those economic projections are the base for Rome's plans to
increase the budget deficit next year. Last week, the European
Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget because it broke
EU rules. [nB5N1SU00Y] 
    Italy's 10-year bond yield was last up 14 bps at 3.47
percent <IT10YT=RR>, above Monday's almost one-month low of 3.27
percent hit on relief that Standard & Poor's did not downgrade
Italy's credit rating after a review on Friday.[nL8N1X92J0]
    The spread over yields on German debt was at 309 bps
<DE10YT=RR>, having narrowed on Monday to around 287 bps.
    Fresh supply added to the upward pressure on Italian yields.
    Italy's Treasury raised the top planned amount of 5.5
billion euros ($6.2 billion) over three bonds. [nS8N1T906W]
    While weak Italian economic growth data hurt Italian bonds, 
softer-than-expected euro zone GDP data and the selloff in
Italian debt leant some support to higher rated bond markets.
    In Germany, the euro zone's benchmark bond issuer, 10-year
bonds yields were down about a basis point at 0.37 percent. 
    Data showed the euro zone economy grew 1.7 percent in the
third quarter compared with 2.2 percent expansion in the
previous quarter, adding to a view that an unwind from the
European Central Bank's ultra-easy monetary policy will be slow.
    ""Softer growth will likely trigger a debate at the ECB
whether the guarantee to keep interest rates at their current
record-low levels should be extended beyond the summer of 2019,""
said Berenberg economist Florian Hense said in a note.
    For now, the GDP data also offset strong German inflation
data. German annual inflation picked up in October to 2.4
percent -- reaching its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years.

    By Nerijus Adomaitis and Gwladys Fouche
    OSLO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - British citizens already living in
Norway and Norwegian citizens living in Britain will have the
right to remain residents, even in case of a no-deal Brexit, the
prime ministers of Britain and Norway said on Tuesday.
    The agreement announced Tuesday was the first concrete step
agreed between Britain and the Nordic country on terms that
would apply after Britain leaves the EU in March. Norway is not
a member of the EU but is part of the single market as a member
of the wider European Economic Area (EEA). 
    ""Prime Minister May and I agreed that Norway and UK will put
in place a comprehensive citizens rights' agreement,"" said Erna
Solberg, prime minister of Norway.
    ""We will treat all UK citizens living in Norway ... so they
will have the same opportunities as they had before also after
March 2019,"" she said, adding that Britain and Norway were ""very
close"" on agreeing a deal to mirror any Brexit deal London
concludes with Brussels. 
    British Prime Minister Theresa May, visiting Oslo, said she
was making the same commitment to Norwegian citizens, as part of
a wider pledge to grant such rights to citizens of all EEA
countries already living in Britain.
    ""Whatever happens, we confirm that people from the EEA, the
Norwegian citizens and those others who are living in the UK,
and who have made their life choice to be in the UK, well, to be
able to be in the UK. We want them to stay.""
    Solberg said that in the event Britain leaves the EU without
a free trade deal with the EEA countries, the most challenging
issue between Norway and Britain would be the trade in goods.
    ""The most difficult part will be goods, especially from
Norway to Britain, because there will be problems on the British
side more than on our side,"" she told Reuters.
    ""We will have to deal only with Britain, but (Britain) will
have to deal with everybody,"" she said after a session of the
Nordic Council at the Norwegian Parliament where May spoke
earlier.
    Britain is Norway's most important trading partner, buying
oil, gas and fish.
    Still, Solberg said she ""absolutely believed"" that Oslo and
London would be able to make ""things function"" between Norway
and Britain even in the case of a hard Brexit.

    By Andy Bruce
    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit would be likely
to tip Britain into a recession as long as the downturn that
followed the global financial crisis, and investors should no
longer ignore this danger, credit ratings agency Standard &
Poor's said on Tuesday. 
    Talks on Britain's departure from the European Union have
stalled over arrangements for the border between the British 
province of Northern Ireland and the Irish republic if a trading
relationship is not agreed in time.
    ""Our base-case scenario is that the UK and the EU will agree
and ratify a Brexit deal,"" S&P Global Ratings credit analyst
Paul Watters said. ""But we believe the risk of a no-deal has
increased sufficiently to become a relevant rating
consideration.""
    S&P has an ""AA"" credit rating for Britain -- a full step
below its top-notch ""AAA"" rating -- but it warned that any
failure by London and Brussels to reach a deal would be likely
to force it to cut the grade further.
    On Monday finance minister Philip Hammond stressed the
importance of getting a deal, saying this would dispel
uncertainty weighing on businesses and allow him to spend money
he is holding back as a reserve. [nL8N1X94Y1]
    Britain would experience a ""moderate"" recession lasting four
to five quarters in the event of a no-deal Brexit, S&P
predicted. This would shrink the world's fifth-largest economy
by 1.2 percent in 2019 and by a further 1.5 percent in 2020.
    ""Most of the economic loss of about 5.5 percent (of) GDP
over three years compared to our base case would likely be
permanent,"" S&P said.
    Unemployment would rise to above 7 percent from around 4
percent now and house prices would be likely to fall by 10
percent over two years, S&P said.
    In London, office prices could shrink by more than 20
percent over two to three years.
    Britain's economy shrank by more than 6 percent during its
last recession in 2008-09 which lasted five quarters, and growth
in wages and productivity has been persistently weak ever since.
    Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month assigned a
median one-in-four chance that Britain leaves the EU in March
with no deal. [ECILT/GB]

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Sao Paulo-October 30: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Chile's Banco de 
Credito e Inversiones's (BCI) Viability Rating (VR) at 'a' and Foreign- and 
Local-Currency Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A'. In addition, 
Fitch has also affirmed its long-term National rating at 'AAA(cl)'. The Rating 
Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions is provided at the end of 
this release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS - BANCO DE CREDITO E INVERSIONES

VR, IDRs AND NATIONAL RATINGS

BCI's IDRs are driven by its VR. The bank's VR is highly influenced by its 
strong company profile, which is tempered by its relatively higher risk appetite 
compared with similarly-rated peers. The bank's franchise has gradually 
strengthened over the years and it is now the third largest bank in Chile as 
measured by total consolidated loans. Fitch views BCI's risk appetite as high 
given its willingness to grow organically and inorganically at a somewhat faster 
pace in recent years.

BCI's VR also considers its more benign operating environment compared with 
other regional peers as well as its overall financial profile, in particular its 
stable profitability and asset quality metrics. Fitch will continue to evaluate 
the bank's ability to sustain its capital and profitability metrics in light of 
future growth, either organic or inorganic. 

In Fitch's view the recent acquisition of Miami, Florida-based TotalBank, a 
former subsidiary of Spain's Banco Popular, at a price of USD529 million, by 
Citi National Bank (CNB) completed on June 2018, is in line with BCI's 
international expansion and diversification strategy that began in late 2015 
with the acquisition of CNB. As a result, the Miami, Florida operation now 
represents 23% of the bank's total consolidated loans. 

This transaction eroded BCI's Fitch core capital (FCC) to risk weighted assets 
(RWA) and its operating profit to RWA ratios. The capital raising of CLP400,804 
million will allow the bank's FCC ratio to recover above 10% by year-end 2018. 
Fitch expects the bank's sound and stable profitability to support capital 
adequacy metrics in the foreseeable future.

Asset quality metrics remain sound and have outperformed some of its regional 
and local peers. This is reflected in a material decrease of non-performing 
loans (NPLs) to 1.4% over the past three years. In Fitch's view, the improving 
trend will probably stabilize due to the still moderate economic growth 
prospects for 2019 in the domestic market. BCI has strengthened its credit risk 
framework, gradually improving its overall portfolio risk profile, impaired 
loans ratio, and economic sector and individual borrower concentrations.

A material increase in RWA after the TotalBank acquisition has steadily 
pressured the bank's operating profit to risk weighted assets (RWAs) ratio, 
which stood at 1.8% at end-June 2018. Fitch expects this ratio to recover in the 
near term. The Walmart credit card portfolio acquisition, which is pending 
regulatory approval, will likely strengthen its franchise in a more profitable 
segment. 

BCI's Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio of 8.4% appears low relative to 
similarly-rated international peers (median for VR 'a' rated banks at about 
14%). However, tougher risk-weighting rules under Basel I penalize capital 
adequacy and profitability metrics relative to RWAs in Chile. The bank's 
internal capital generation is the highest among its local peers, although 
partially offset by its relatively higher growth appetite. 

BCI's funding is diversified, including a large core customer deposits base. BCI 
has stable long-term funding and established market access as demonstrated by 
its recent bond issuances in both international and domestic markets. Liquidity 
management is also strong, with the bank reporting a Basel III liquidity 
coverage ratio above 100%. 

SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) 

BCI's SR of '1' and SRF of 'A-' are based on Fitch's view that BCI is a domestic 
systemically important bank (D-SIB), underpinning the government's propensity to 
support the bank should it be required. In Fitch's view, the Republic of Chile 
has a strong capacity to support the bank as indicated by its Foreign-Currency 
Long-Term IDR of 'A'/Outlook Stable.

SENIOR UNSECURED AND SUBORDINATED DEBT AND EQUITY RATINGS

BCI's senior unsecured bonds are rated at the same level as its National 
long-term rating, considering the absence of credit enhancement or subordination 
feature.

Fitch rates BCI's National scale subordinated debt two notches below its 
National long-term issuer rating. The two-notch difference considers the loss 
severity due to its subordinated nature (after default), and no additional 
notching for non-performance risk given the subordinated debt's gone concern 
feature (triggered after the point of non-viability).

The rating of BCI common shares of 'Primera Clase Nivel 1(cl)' considers the 
bank's solvency, reflected in its 'AAA(cl)' national rating, and the high 
liquidity of the shares and market value of the bank.

KEY RATING DRIVERS - EMPRESAS JUAN YARUR

NATIONAL RATINGS

Empresas Juan Yarur's (EJY) national ratings are based on the creditworthiness 
of its main subsidiary. EJY is the sole parent company of BCI and operates as a 
shell holding company (BHC). EJY's national ratings are equalized with those of 
BCI, its main subsidiary,  which represented 95% of its affiliate investments 
and accounted for 90% of its total recurring dividends flow at end-June 2018.

EJY's double leverage has consistently declined, reaching 1.0x  at end-June 
2018. EJY does not carry relevant intangibles or goodwill and Fitch does not 
expect a material change over the medium term. BCI's capital increase will be 
financed by EJY debt in the domestic market. In the event that the entire 
capital increase is financed with EJY debt, its level of double leverage would 
increase to approximately 1.1x from 1.0x currently, which would continue to be 
adequate for the equalization of its national ratings with those of its main 
investment, BCI. Additionally, EJY's level of individual financial debt is one 
of the lowest among financial holding companies rated by Fitch in Chile and its 
debt service coverage ratios with dividend flows are ample. Fitch expects EJY's 
coverage of debt service with dividends to remain consistently strong over 
medium term.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

BANCO DE CREDITO E INVERSIONES 

IDRs, VR, AND NATIONAL RATINGS 

The Rating Outlook for the Long-Term IDRs and National rating is Stable. 
Currently, there is no upside potential as this bank is rated at the sovereign 
and the current Outlook on Chile's ratings is Stable. In addition, the entity's 
VR is among the highest for similar banks in emerging markets and Fitch does not 
foresee any potential upgrade over the medium term.

BCI's VR and IDRs could be downgraded if there is a sustained deterioration in 
the bank's FCC ratio below 10%, an increase in NPLs/gross loans above 2%, or a 
decline in operating profit/RWAs below 2%. A material increase in the bank's 
already higher risk appetite could also be negative for these ratings.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

The SR and SRF are potentially sensitive to any change in assumptions as to the 
propensity or ability of the Chilean government to provide timely support to the 
bank. This could arise in the event of a sovereign rating action. Currently, the 
Outlook on Chile's Long-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency IDRs is Stable.

SENIOR UNSECURED AND SUBORDINATED DEBT AND EQUITY RATINGS

Senior and subordinated debt ratings would generally move together with the 
bank's long-term National rating. The subordinated debt will remain two notches 
below the bank's National long-term rating.

The rating of BCI common shares could be affected by a multiple notch downgrade 
of the bank's national long-term rating or a significant decrease of the 
liquidity of the shares or of the market value of the bank.

EMPRESAS JUAN YARUR

The Rating Outlook for the Long-Term National rating is Stable. Fitch does not 
expect changes over the medium term. EJY's National ratings are aligned with 
those of BCI and future rating actions will generally be in line with those of 
its main subsidiary. However, a deterioration of EJY's individual financial debt 
metrics, specifically an increase in its double leverage ratio to levels 
consistently higher than 120%, or a significant decline in its debt service 
coverage ratio to levels below those projected by Fitch, could be negative for 
creditworthiness. EJY's senior debt ratings would generally move in line with 
its National ratings.

Fitch has affirmed BCI's ratings as follows:

--Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'A'; Outlook Stable;

--Viability rating at 'a';

--Long-term foreign-currency senior unsecured at 'A';

--Long-term National rating at 'AAA(cl)'; Outlook Stable;

--National long-term rating senior unsecured bonds at 'AAA(cl)'; 

--Long-term National rating subordinated bonds at 'AA(cl)';

--Foreign and Local Currency Short-Term IDRs at 'F1';

--Support Rating at '1';

--Support Rating Floor at 'A-';

--Short-term National rating at 'N1+(cl)';

--National equity rating at 'Primera Clase Nivel 1'.

Fitch has affirmed Empresas Juan Yarur (EJY)'s ratings as follows:

--National long-term rating at 'AAA(cl)'; Outlook Stable;

--National short-term rating at 'N1+(cl)';

--National long-term senior unsecured bonds at 'AAA(cl)';

--National long-term commercial paper at 'AAA(cl)';

--National short-term commercial paper at 'N1+(cl)'.

    By David Randall
    NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Broad gains in the U.S. equity
market turned global stocks higher on Tuesday after President
Donald Trump said a ""great deal"" could be struck with China that
would relieve fears of a growing trade war between the world's
two largest economies. 
    The euro wallowed near a 10-week low of $1.1352 as the
dollar <.DXY> climbed to a 2 1/2-month peak against a basket of
the world's top six currencies. [nL8N1XA5N1]
    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS>
gained 0.31 percent. Still, the index is down nearly 10 percent
for the month. 
    Investors remained cautious despite the modest global gains.
    ""At this point, nobody can say the equity market is
bottoming out. Global investor sentiment remains shaky,"" said
Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in
Tokyo.    
    Market participants also kept hopes in check regarding
trade.
    ""We don't see the trade war being resolved any time soon,""
said Rabobank's senior macroeconomic strategist Teeuwe Mevissen.
""And it comes at a time when we see all the sentiment indicators
in the euro zone but also in the U.S., too, cooling down.""
    Trump said during an interview with Fox News he thought
there could be an agreement with China on trade, but said he had
billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to be imposed if
a deal was not possible. [nL3N1XA2RX]
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 189.08 points,
or 0.77 percent, to 24,632, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 14.5
points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,655.75 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 33.79 points, or 0.48 percent, to 7,084.08.
[nL3N1XA6C0]
    The gains were broad in the U.S., with 9 of the 11 sectors
of the benchmark S&P index up for the day. Trade-sensitive
industrial shares rose nearly 0.7 percent in mid-afternoon
trading. 
    General Electric Co <GE.N>, however, fell 11 percent. GE
slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share, promised to
restructure its power unit and said it faced a deeper accounting
probe. [nL3N1XA4LJ]
    Meanwhile, data showed the Italian economy had ground to a
halt in the third quarter as both domestic demand and trade
flows failed to spur growth. [nR1N1W500K]
    The flat reading was the weakest since the fourth quarter of
2014 and renewed pressure on Italy's government debt in the bond
markets. [nL8N1XA2VB]
    The pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> rose 0.01 percent.
[nL8N1XA2CC]
    The chill around China and global trade left emerging-
market stocks at an 18-month low, with MSCI's index <.MSCIEF>
down for a sixth day in a row. 
    Oil prices fell more than 1 percent in choppy trading on
signs of rising supply and concern global economic growth and
fuel demand would be hit by a deepening of the U.S.-China trade
dispute. [nL3N1XA1QT]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> fell 1.45 percent to $66.07 per barrel
and Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $75.75, down 2.06 percent.
    Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> last fell 6/32 in price
to yield 3.1076 percent, from 3.087 percent late on Monday.

 (Adds railway announcing bid)
    By Giulia Segreti
    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Major companies on Tuesday ruled
out involvement in a new rescue of Alitalia, complicating a plan
led by Rome in which state-controlled railway Ferrovie dello
Stato (FS) <IPO-FERRO.MI> will bid for the airline and look to
bring in partners.  
    Alitalia was put under special administration last year, 
leaving the government once again seeking a buyer to save the
carrier. It will be the airline's third rescue in a decade.  
    FS said its board had decided to put in an offer to buy
Alitalia, but gave no further details. 
    A source close to the deal had earlier told Reuters that
FS's bid would only be a ""transitional phase"". 
    The source added the deal would be completed in two separate
steps, with FS picking up Alitalia on set conditions and then,
at a later stage, being joined by an Italian partner and a
international one, from the airline sector. 
    The source said there was very little visibility on the next
steps, and it was not clear which partners would join FS.
    ""The situation is very messy,"" the source said. 
    Earlier this month Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio
suggested that state-controlled companies like oil major Eni
<ENI.MI>, postal operator Poste <PST.MI> and defence group
Leonardo <LDOF.MI> could all play a role in the relaunch. 
    Di Maio, also industry minister, said that there were many
private investors also interested in Alitalia. [nS8N1RT01Q] 
    But on Tuesday Eni said that any suggestion that it might
pick up a stake in the carrier was ""groundless"" and that it
would not play a role in the rescue, a spokesperson said.
    Leonardo too will not join any relaunch of Alitalia, which
has already accumulated a loss of over 300 million euros
($340.86 million), a separate source close to the matter told
Reuters.
    ""It would be crazy for Leonardo to enter this madness,"" the
source said. Shares in the group were down almost 1.5 percent at
1600 GMT after Italian dailies had reported that the company
would be involved in an effort spearheaded by FS.   
    Last month Poste Chief Executive Matteo del Fante said the
group was ""not at all interested"" in joining an overhaul effort
for the airline.

    Alitalia has cost Italian tax payers almost 10 billion euros

added together, according to Andrea Giuricin, CEO of transport
advisory firm TRA Consulting. 
    Last year Alitalia accounted for only 8.5 percent of the
international traffic to and from Italy, Giuricin added, just
under a third of Ryanair's share.  
    The sale process was delayed due to the change of Italian
government earlier this year, but the ruling coalition, that
comprises the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
far-right League, pledged it would close a deal by Wednesday. 
    Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> said earlier on Tuesday that
it had no interest in participating in a government-led
restructuring effort. [nL8N1XA2FU]
    Alitalia must pay back the Italian state almost 1 billion
euros in a bridge loan and related interest by mid-December.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 30: Fitch Ratings has assigned the following rating 
and Rating Outlook to Crown Point CLO 7 Ltd.:

--$288,000,000 class A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

Fitch does not rate the class B, C, D, and E notes or the subordinated notes.

TRANSACTION SUMMARY

Crown Point CLO 7 Ltd. (the issuer) is an arbitrage cash flow collateralized 
loan obligation (CLO) managed by Pretium Credit Management LLC (Pretium). The 
secured notes will provide financing on a portfolio of approximately $450 
million of primarily first lien senior secured leveraged loans. The CLO will 
have an approximately five-year reinvestment period and a two-year noncall 
period.

Key Rating Drivers 

Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) of 36% for the class A 
notes, in addition to excess spread, is sufficient to protect against portfolio 
default and recovery rate projections in the 'AAAsf' stress scenario. Compared 
with CE levels of recent CLO issuances for notes in the same rating category, 
the degree of CE available is below the average, but cash flow modeling 
indicates performance in line with other 'AAAsf' notes. 

'B' Asset Quality: The average credit quality of the indicative portfolio is 'B 
', which is comparable with recent CLOs. Issuers rated in the 'B' rating 
category denote a highly speculative credit quality; however, in Fitch's 
opinion, class A notes are unlikely to be affected by the foreseeable level of 
defaults. Class A notes are projected to be able to withstand default rates of 
up to 59.5%.

Strong Recovery Expectations: The indicative portfolio consists of 100% first 
lien senior secured loans. Approximately 97.2% of the indicative portfolio has 
either strong recovery prospects or a Fitch-assigned Recovery Rating of 'RR2' or 
higher, resulting in a base case recovery assumption of 80.8%. In determining 
the ratings for the class A notes, Fitch stressed the indicative portfolio by 
assuming a higher portfolio concentration of assets with lower recovery 
prospects and further reduced recovery assumptions for higher rating stresses, 
resulting in 37.8% recovery rate in Fitch's 'AAAsf' scenario. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Fitch evaluated the notes' sensitivity to the potential variability of key model 
assumptions, including decreases in recovery rates and increases in default 
rates. Results under these sensitivity scenarios ranged between 'BB+sf' and 
'AA+sf' for the class A notes.

USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10

Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
relation to this rating action.

DATA ADEQUACY

The majority of the underlying assets or risk-presenting entities have ratings 
or credit opinions from Fitch and/or other Nationally Recognised Statistical 
Rating Organisations and/or European Securities and Markets Authority-registered 
rating agencies. Fitch has relied on the practices of the relevant groups within 
Fitch and/or other rating agencies to assess the asset portfolio information.

Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the 
agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies 
indicates that it is adequately reliable.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION

The information below was used in the analysis.

--Loan-by-loan data provided by the arranger at Oct. 17, 2018;

--Transaction documents provided by the arranger at Oct. 23, 2018.

REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and that relate 
to the underlying asset pool was not prepared for this transaction. Offering 
documents for U.S. CLO transactions do not typically include RW&Es that are 
available to investors and that relate to the asset pool underlying the 
security. Therefore, Fitch credit reports for U.S. CLO transactions will not 
typically include descriptions of RW&Es. For further information, please see

Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,"" dated May 31, 2016.

    By David Randall
    NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Broad gains in the U.S. equity
market boosted a measure of  global stock markets on Tuesday
after President Donald Trump said a ""great deal"" could be struck
with China that would relieve fears of a growing trade war
between the world's two largest economies. 
    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS>
gained 1 percent. Still, the index is down nearly 9 percent for
the month. 
    Investors remained cautious despite the modest gains. 
    ""At this point, nobody can say the equity market is
bottoming out. Global investor sentiment remains shaky,"" said
Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in
Tokyo.    
    Market participants also kept their hopes in check regarding
trade.
    ""We don't see the trade war being resolved any time soon,""
said Rabobank's senior macroeconomic strategist Teeuwe Mevissen.
""And it comes at a time when we see all the sentiment indicators
in the euro zone but also in the U.S., too, cooling down.""
    Trump said during an interview with Fox News late on Monday
that he thought there could be an agreement with China on trade.
But he also said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs
ready to be imposed if a deal was not possible. [nL3N1XA2RX]
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 431.72 points,
or 1.77 percent, to 24,874.64, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 41.38
points, or 1.57 percent, to 2,682.63 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 111.36 points, or 1.58 percent, to 7,161.65.
[nL3N1XA6C0]
    The gains were broad, with all 11 sectors of the benchmark
S&P index up for the day. The rally helped turn both the S&P 500
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average once again positive for the
year, though each is up less than 1 percent since the beginning
of January. Both were up over 7 percent for the year at the
start of October. 
    “This is a continuation of the recovery we saw yesterday,”
said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer with Hugh Johnson
Advisors in Albany, New York. 
    General Electric Co <GE.N>, however, fell nearly 9 percent.
GE slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share, promised
to restructure its power unit and said it faced a deeper
accounting probe. [nL3N1XA4LJ]
    Meanwhile, data showed the Italian economy had ground to a
halt in the third quarter as both domestic demand and trade
flows failed to spur growth. [nR1N1W500K]
    The flat reading was the weakest since the fourth quarter of
2014 and renewed pressure on Italy's government debt in the bond
markets. [nL8N1XA2VB]
    The pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> rose 0.01 percent.
[nL8N1XA2CC]
    The chill around China and global trade left emerging-
market stocks at an 18-month low, with MSCI's index <.MSCIEF>
down for a sixth day in a row. 
    The euro wallowed near a 10-week low of $1.1352 as the
dollar <.DXY> climbed to a 2 1/2-month peak against a basket of
the world's top six currencies. [nL8N1XA5N1]
    Oil prices fell more than 1 percent in choppy trading on
signs of rising supply and concern that global economic growth
and demand for fuel would be hit by a deepening of the
U.S.-China trade dispute. [nL3N1XA1QT]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> fell 1.28 percent to $66.18 per barrel
and Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $76.07, down 1.64 percent.
    Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> last fell
7/32 in price to yield 3.1132 percent, from 3.087 percent late
on Monday. [nL2N1XA0U9]

Shanghai on Wednesday after data showed that China's
manufacturing sector grew at its weakest pace in more than two
years, dampening the outlook for demand in the world's top
metals consumer. 
    Amid rising headwinds from the Sino-U.S. trade row, China's
official Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 50.2 in October
from 50.8 in September, only slightly above the 50-point mark
that separates growth from contraction. [nL3N1X43JC]
    The latest reading suggests a further slowing in the world's
second-biggest economy and could prompt more policy support from
Beijing on top of a raft of recent initiatives.
    The most-traded December zinc on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange <SZNcv1> was down 1.8 percent at 21,545 yuan ($3,093) a
tonne by 0152 GMT. Copper <SCFcv1> dropped 1.4 percent to 49,160
yuan.
    
    * LME METALS: Three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange <CMCU3> was up 0.1 percent at $6,039 a tonne and zinc
<CMZN3> was flat at $2,549.
    * CHINA'S YUAN: As China's yuan approaches the 7 to the
dollar barrier, investors are betting authorities will
eventually let the currency fall beyond the historic level. Yet
they are just as confident that China won't allow the kind of
capitulation seen in past market meltdowns. [nL3N1XA475]
    * NYRSTAR HIT: Falling zinc prices, along with rising energy
prices and higher mine operating expenses, caused third-quarter
core profit at metals producer Nyrstar NV <NYR.BR> to drop 74
percent. LME zinc has lost more than 2 percent in October, on
course for its eighth monthly loss in nine.
    * EQUITIES, DOLLAR: Asian stocks pulled away from 20-month
lows to eke out small gains, thanks to a rebound on Wall Street.
The dollar hovered near 16-month highs versus a basket of its
major rivals. [MKTS/GLOB] [USD/]

    SINGAPORE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen edged lower
against the dollar on Wednesday after the Bank of Japan signaled
it was a long way off from exiting crisis-era stimulus, while
the greenback scaled 16-month highs versus its key rivals on
continued strength in the U.S. economy.
    The Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept monetary policy steady on
Wednesday and cut its price forecasts, reinforcing market
expectations that subdued inflation will force it to maintain
its massive stimulus programme for the time being.
    In a widely expected move, the BOJ maintained its short-term
interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide
10-year government bond yields around zero percent.[nT9N1V002M]
    The yen <JPY=> changed hands at 113.24 on the dollar,
remaining under pressure in Asia after earlier sliding to
three-week lows at 113.32. The dollar had gained 0.6 percent on
the yen the previous day.
    ""I still see the main driver for the dollar/yen to be U.S.
10 year bond yields and the overall level of risk aversion in
the system which can be gauged by the VIX index,"" said Sim Moh
Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
     The U.S. 10-year treasury bond yields <US10YT=RR> rose for
the third consecutive trading session on Wednesday and were last
at 3.13 percent. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield
<JP10YTN=JBTC> was 0.12 percent, highlighting the wide gap in
favour of the dollar.
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value versus six
major peers, climbed to a fresh 16-month high to hit 97.06.
    The U.S. currency benefited from stronger than expected U.S.
economic data as well as deteriorating fundamentals for the
euro, which makes up around 58 percent of the index. 
    U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high in October,
driven largely a robust labour market, suggesting strong
economic growth could persist in the near term. That follows
last week's data which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than
expected in the third quarter. [nL2N1XA0TK]
    In contrast, economic data out of Europe disappointed
analysts as the euro zone economy grew less than expected in the
third quarter. [nL8N1XA3CW]
    The euro <EUR=> changed hands at $1.1343, steady from its
New York close, though it has lost 2.3 percent versus the
greenback in October.
    Political uncertainty in Germany, following chancellor
Angela Merkel’s decision to step down in 2021, is also
pressuring the single currency. Moreover, the stand-off between
Rome and Brussels over Italy's free spending budget, which is in
breach of the European Union's fiscal rules, has weighed on the
euro.
      Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS, said in a note to
clients that the gloomy backdrop might push the euro down to
$1.12 in the current quarter, and is tipping an even lower 
$1.05-1.10 range in the first half of 2019. 
    The sterling <GBP=> held close to its mid-August lows,
hovering at $1.2705, after credit ratings agency Standard &
Poor's said a 'no-deal' Brexit would be likely to tip Britain
into a recession on Tuesday.[nL8N1XA6W7][[nS8N1US003]
    Some immediate catalysts for the sterling traders could come
from the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday,
when it is expected to keep interest rates on hold and detail
conditions necessary for policy tightening.
    The yuan <CNY=CFXS> was relatively flat in onshore trading
at 6.9663, though it remains on a downward path after it fell to
its lowest level in a decade this week.
    With no sign of a let-up in the Sino-U.S. trade war,
investors are betting on more weakness ahead and expect
authorities will eventually allow the yuan to breach the key 7
to the dollar level for the first time since the global
financial crisis.[nL3N1XA475]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> dipped 0.3 percent to $0.7084
after the release of tepid inflation data reinforced views that
a rate increase remains a distant prospect.
