 (Recasts with low turnout, adds quotes)
    By Ivana Sekularac and Kole Casule
    SKOPJE, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Macedonia's prime minister
pledged on Sunday to press on with a vote in parliament to
change the country's name, although his coalition acknowledged a
referendum appeared to have failed to secure the 50 percent
turnout needed to make it legally valid.
    The proposed name change is part of an agreement reached in
June by pro-Western Prime Minister Zoran Zaev with Macedonia's
neighbour Greece to resolve a decades-old dispute that had
prevented Macedonia from joining NATO or the EU.
    With the official turnout tally stuck at 34 percent half an
hour before polls closed, a ruling coalition official
acknowledged that it seemed unlikely that the 50 percent
threshold would be reached. The opposition said the low turnout
proved that Macedonians had rejected the name change.
    Election officials still had not updated the official
turnout figure hours after polls shut. Partial results showed
that the people who did vote overwhelmingly backed the name
change -- more than 90 percent voted yes with 63 percent of
polling stations reporting.
    But that had never been in doubt, since opponents of the
change had urged followers not to vote, rather than vote no.
    ""It is clear that the agreement with Greece has not received
the green light from the people,"" main nationalist opposition
VMRO-DPMNE party leader Hristiajn Mickoski told journalists.
    In an address, Zaev made no mention of the turnout but said
most people who had voted had backed the change and their votes
must be respected. He pledged to hold a vote in parliament on
the name change, and said he would call an early election if
lawmakers failed to give it the two-thirds majority needed to
change the constitution.
    ""I am determined  to take Macedonia into the European Union
and NATO,"" Zaev said.
    
    BLOW
    While the referendum is officially not binding, a failure to
reach the turnout threshold would be a blow to Zaev.
    The Greek foreign ministry said it respected the will of the
people of the country, which it refers to by the provisional
name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
    The referendum passed judgment on the agreement with Greece
reached in June, under which Macedonia would change its name to
the Republic of North Macedonia. Greece, which has a province
called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name
represents a claim on its territory.
    Because of the dispute, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's
entrance into NATO and the EU. While a majority of Macedonians
want to join NATO and the EU, nationalist opponents of the name
change argued that it undermines the ethnic identity of
Macedonia's Slavic majority population. 
    The question on the referendum ballot read: ""Are you for
NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with
Greece"".
    ""It is clear now that it (turnout) is unlikely to reach the
threshold of 50 pct,"" the ruling party official told Reuters.
    Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told 
Greek radio on Sunday: ""We are looking forward to a positive
result for the validation process to continue and to move to the
next stage, the constitutional revision.""
    Supporters of the name change argue that it is a price worth
paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
    ""I came today to vote for the future of the country, for
young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the
umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for
all of us,"" said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
    But opponents said the name change represented national
humiliation.
    ""We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads
up, not through the service door,"" said Vladimir Kavadarkov, who
backed the referendum boycott. ""We are a poor country, but we do
have dignity.""

change the country's name to resolve a decades-old dispute with

June by pro-Western Prime Minister Zoran Zaev with Greece to
resolve the dispute over the country's name, which had prevented
Macedonia from joining NATO or the EU.
    With 85 percent of votes counted, official turnout was just
36 percent, and election officials made clear there was no
chance the threshold would be cleared.
    ""On this referendum, it is clear that the decision has not
been made,"" election commission head Oliver Derkoski told
reporters.
    The people who did vote overwhelmingly backed the name
change -- more than 90 percent voted yes with 63 percent of
polling stations reporting. But that had never been in doubt,
since opponents of the change had urged followers not to vote,
rather than vote no.
    ""It is clear that the agreement with Greece has not received
the green light from the people,"" main nationalist opposition
VMRO-DPMNE party leader Hristiajn Mickoski told journalists.
    The referendum was itself not legally binding, but lawmakers
had pledged to abide by it, and the failure to reach the turnout
threshold means opponents can now freely vote against the deal.
    The nationalist opposition holds 49 seats in the 120-seat
parliament, enough to block the two-thirds majority required to
change the constitution.
    In an address, Zaev made no mention of the turnout but said
the votes of those who had backed the change must be respected.
He pledged to hold a vote in parliament on the name change, and
call an early election if lawmakers failed to enact it.
    ""I am determined to take Macedonia into the European Union
and NATO,"" Zaev said. He spoke again later in the evening, along
similar lines: ""It is time to support European Macedonia.""

9,23,ffafa5bd8983519bbbe3d5d1dc95f10c,Irish consumer sentiment falls to 21-month low on Brexit worries,2018-10-01 7:01:01,EUR,-3.65911,2018-10-01 7:02:09,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    DUBLIN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Irish consumer sentiment weakened in September to its lowest level in 21 months as worries around Brexit and rising energy and housing costs weighed, a survey showed on Monday.
    Ireland is likely to be the fasting growing economy in Europe this year for the fifth year in a row, but the recovery has been uneven for some consumers, with only modest gains in purchasing power.
    The KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index slipped to 96.4 in September from 102.4 in August and 107.6 in July. The second consecutive decline ends a see-saw pattern of monthly changes since the index hit a 17-year high in January.
    The survey's authors said in a statement that the fall represents a clear drop in confidence among Irish consumers and reflects a significant downgrade in views on household finances and the broader economic outlook.
    ""There is little doubt that the increasingly loud and jarring ticking of the Brexit clock has unnerved Irish consumers,"" KBC Ireland Chief Economist Austin Hughes said.
    ""The threat posed by a possible 'hard Brexit' is notably amplified by high profile cost increases in areas such as light, heating and housing while many consumers may feel their personal circumstances are very remote from recent reports of a return to the boom.""
    For the first time since December 2016, a larger share of consumers (23 percent) felt their financial circumstances had worsened over the previous year, than felt they had improved (21 percent),the survey found.

    Ireland's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index eased slightly to 56.3 from 57.5 in August. The September level matches that of July and extends a run above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction to 64 months.

agreed to co-invest with IFG, subject to further due diligence.
    Together, the seven deposits will produce up to 5,700 tonnes
of tungsten per year, or roughly 6 percent of the world's total
output by 2024, she said.
    ""We expect to become world's third-biggest producer,""
Ponkratova said.
    The global market for tungsten, used to strengthen steel, is
dominated by China, which accounts for about 80 percent of
production. IFG Capital plans to sell the metal under an
off-take agreement with traders for resale in Europe and the
United States.
    Ponkratova's partners in IFG Capital are Dmitri Musienko, a
former banker and commodities trader at Credit Suisse and
Barclays, and Olim Shadiev, a Moscow-educated entrepreneur with
Uzbek roots.
    Shadiev's uncle, Patokh Chodiyev, is one of the three
billionaire co-owners of Eurasian Resources Group, a metals and
mining company with assets in Kazakhstan, Brazil and several
African countries.
    Ponkratova said Chodiyev was not involved in the operations
of IFG Capital, which is acting independently and has been
advising the Tashkent government on economic reforms for the
last two years.
    ""We believe Uzbekistan is the rising star of the region,""
she said.
    She said IFG Capital expected to develop the tungsten
deposits under concession agreements.
    The company is also considering investments in Uzbekistan's
gold mining industry, the nation's biggest source of exports, 
and the financial sector, Ponkratova said.
    Uzbekistan's Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources
declined to comment on the planned deal.
    Mirziyoyev, a former prime minister, came to power after the
death of Uzbekistan's first president, Islam Karimov, who
resisted market reforms and largely kept in place a Soviet-style
state-dominated economy.
    Seeking to end the economic stagnation which has led
millions of Uzbeks to seek employment abroad, Mirziyoyev
promised to implement broad economic reforms and bring in
foreign investment.
    So far, however, money has been flowing in mostly from
international institutions such as the World Bank or the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, rather than
from private companies.

    There seems to be white smoke coming out of the Nafta negotiations with a Canadian source
confirming a deal, prompting a jump in the Canadian currency. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 43 points higher and Paris' CAC to
rise 21 points on trade war relief.   
    Things are not looking so good for London's FTSE which is seen opening 4 points lower. 
    ""The FTSE is pointing to a lower start to trading on the opening bell, with miners expected
to weigh heavily"", wrote Jasper Lawler, head of research London Capital Group as two surveys
showed on Sunday that growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September.
    ""Metals across the board traded lower overnight following yet another round of disappointing

down unexpectedly in August, data showed on Monday, suggesting
that household spending lost some steam as a growth driver in
Europe's biggest economy over the summer.
    The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision,
showed retail sales fell by 0.1 percent on the month in real

    This was weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast for a
0.4 percent rise and followed a downwardly revised drop of 1.1
percent in July.
    On the year, retail rose by 1.6 percent, beating the Reuters
consensus forecast for a 1.5 percent increase.
    Private consumption has become a key growth driver in
Germany where consumers benefit from record-high employment,
rising real wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
    The retail sales data followed a GfK survey published last

economic growth in the fourth quarter despite rising inflation.

    The NEVI/IHS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 59.8 from 59.1 in August. Five months of decline had resulted in a 14-month low reading of 58.0 in July.
    “The Dutch manufacturing sector continued to defy a wider eurozone slowdown in September,"" said Trevor Balchin, Director at IHS Markit, which compiles the Netherlands Manufacturing PMI survey.
    ""The strength of demand inevitably translated into further pressure on supply chains and prices,"" he said. The Netherlands was 6.5 points above the eurozone average, the widest differential since the Dutch survey began in March 2000.
    The latest survey results also showed output rising for the sixty-fifth consecutive month, a survey record, while new export orders increased at the fastest rate in seven months.
   The rate of job creation quickened for the first time in eight months. Supplier delays also increased, leading to cost pressures.

    BERLIN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - German retail sales edged down
unexpectedly for the second month in a row in August, data
showed on Monday, suggesting that trade disputes abroad and
political tensions at home dampened consumer morale in Europe's
largest economy over the summer.
    Household spending has become a key growth driver in Germany
where consumers benefit from record-high employment, rising real
wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
    Retail sales fell by 0.1 percent on the month in real terms
in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. This was weaker

followed a downwardly revised drop of 1.1 percent in July.
    On the year, retail rose by 1.6 percent, beating the Reuters
consensus forecast for a 1.5 percent increase and following a
revised 0.9 percent increase in July. Retail sales data is a
volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision.
    ""The economic environment for consumption is still
excellent, but many consumers are worried about U.S. tariff
disputes and the many open conflicts in the federal government"",
HDE retail association head Josef Sanktjohanser said.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition has quarrelled
over refugees, immigration and right-wing extremism over the
past months which brought the government close to collapse.
    Sanktjohanser said policymakers must now ensure stability
and dependability at all levels so that consumers would not be
unsettled further by political bickering.
    The retail sales data followed a GfK survey published last
week that showed the mood among German shoppers improved heading
into October, suggesting that consumers will feed overall
economic growth in the fourth quarter despite rising inflation.

in September ... Manufacturers will be hoping for demand
conditions to strengthen over the rest of the year to help
invigorate output growth, which is currently running at the
slowest for two years,"" Associate Director at IHS Markit Andrew
Harker said.  
    Gross domestic product data, released on Friday, showed
Spain's economic expansion slowed to its lowest pace in annual
terms in the second quarter since the end of 2014, dragged down
by weaker exports. [nL8N1WE1CL]

    The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell in September to 50.0 from 50.1 in August, posting its seventh fall in eight months and settling on the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
    The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts had pointed to a slight increase to 50.3.
    September's reading was the lowest since August 2016, when the index last dipped below 50, and is 9 points below the seven-year high of 59.0 registered in January.
    Markit said its sub-index for manufacturers' new orders indicated that orders were shrinking for a second consecutive month. The index rose to 49.7 from 48.7 in August, when it fell below 50 for the first time in two years.
    The sub-index on manufacturing output also stayed just below the 50 mark for a second straight month, Markit said.

    Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index fell to 52.5 in September from 53.5 in August, unchanged from a preliminary reading. 
    The result brought the indicator closer to the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
    Survey panellists reported the lowest factory output in two years as export orders fell slightly last month,  while input costs grew much fast than selling prices.
    ""Global trade frictions and stretched supply chain capacity were the main headwinds faced by goods producers, which contributed to an unhealthy mix of falling export sales and rising input prices,"" IHS Markit associate director Tim Moore said.
    He said that the automotive sector in particular reported weak business conditions, but said that in a positive note overall firms stepped up hiring.
    ""Job creation edged up slightly since August, which manufacturers linked to long-term capacity upgrades and ongoing business investment plans at their plants,"" he said.
    Business investment has been one of the main engines of growth in the French economy this year, helping to underpin employment gains in the face of weak household consumption.

    Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the German economy, fell to 53.7 in September, from 55.9 in August. That was in line with a flash reading.
    ""It was inevitable that growth would pull back from the high levels seen last year, but the recent waning of exports has really taken the wind out of manufacturers' sails in the last couple of months,"" Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, said.
    He said that an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, uncertainty surrounding Britain's planned exit from the European Union and Turkey's currency crisis were factors in the growth slowdown.
    That assessment echoed Germany's leading economic institutes, which last week cut their 2018 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 1.7 percent from 2.2 percent. 
    ""Uncertainty in the global market has clouded the outlook, which has led to manufacturers significantly lowering their expectations of where output levels will be in a year's time,"" Smith said.
    The manufacturing sector entered a cooling phase this year after an all-time high reading in December 2017.
    Economists attribute this partly to the increasingly protectionist policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, which have clouded the outlook for Germany's export-dependent manufacturers.
    The German economy has been relying on private consumption and government spending for growth.
    ""The main positive takeaway was another strong round of hiring in the goods-producing sector, which will provide further impetus to domestic demand,"" Smith said. ""It's likely, however, that we'll see recruitment slow in coming months if capacity pressures continue to ease.""

    BOUNCEBACK FOR ITALY: WAS FRIDAY AN OVERREACTION? (0914 GMT)
    There's still a healthy debate in the market over what exactly Italy's new budget implies
for the country, and for investors. 
    Today we're seeing a pretty strong bounceback from Italian stocks, up 1.5 percent,
indicating the market is leaning towards a more bullish interpretation. 
    Interestingly Italian bond yields are still rising, though, and the equity bounce is being
driven mostly by Italy's international consumer stocks Fiat Chrysler, Moncler, Ferrari,
Luxottica and Salvatore Ferragamo.
    Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen is one of those who thinks Friday's selloff was overdone.
    ""I don't like the indicated increase in the deficit, but the math just does not justify the
price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!"" writes Nielsen in his Sunday note. 
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the deficit next year to 2.4% of GDP
instead of the widely expected 2.0% of GDP should raise the average funding cost by maybe some 5
to 10 basis points - not by anything like 25-40bp!"" 
    Whether the spread will come back down again will depend on the future path of the budget
from 2020, ratings agencies which may downgrade Italy, and the possibility of President
Mattarella entering the fray, he reckons.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE INCHES UP AS Q4 STARTS (0723 GMT)
    European shares are off to a rather subdued start on the first day of the quarter with main
benchmarks hovering slightly above parity. 
    The NAFTA deal is giving some support and it also seems that Italian equities are attempting
a bounce back following Friday's sell-off on budget expansion worries. 
    ""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade
agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of Q4, and may offer
encouragement that the other global trade disputes can settled satisfactorily,"" says Peel Hunt's
Ian Williams in his daily note.
    An outlook cut from Ryanair however is weighing a bit, dragging down airlines stocks.
Airlines have recently come under pressure on oil prices surging to multi-year highs.

    ON THE RADAR: M&A AND IPOS AND NO NAFTA EXUBERANCE (0651 GMT) 
    European futures are pointing to an only slightly positive open. Nothing extravagant as
investors take the view that the U.S. trade war dispute with China is far from over.
    Poor macro data from China is also likely to weigh on miners and basic materials, meaning
that the FTSE could actually lose some ground at the open. 
    Among potential movers is France's supermarket retailer Casino, one of the most shorted
stock on the French market, selling property assets for 565 millions euros in a bid to reduce
debt and answers critics such as Muddy Waters. 
    More M&A with Veolia selling a 30 percent stake in Transdev to Germany’s Rethmann, Avocet
Mining hinting a breakup and Mitie’s deal to sell its pest control business to Rentokil.

its books.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES MAKE CAUTIOUS START (0609 GMT) 
    European futures have made a cautious start this morning with the Nafta deal prompting
measured optimism rather than irrational exuberance among investors. 
    The FTSE is currently lagging its European peers with miners, index heavyweights, expected
to suffer from poor data in China. 
    Here's what it looks like at the moment:

    NAFTA WHITE SMOKE SEEN LIFTING EUROPE AT THE OPEN (0525 GMT)
    There seems to be white smoke coming out of the Nafta negotiations with a Canadian source
confirming a deal, prompting a jump in the Canadian currency. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 43 points higher and Paris' CAC to
rise 21 points on trade war relief.   
    Things are not looking so good for London's FTSE which is seen opening 4 points lower. 
    ""The FTSE is pointing to a lower start to trading on the opening bell, with miners expected
to weigh heavily"", wrote Jasper Lawler, head of research London Capital Group as two surveys
showed on Sunday that growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September.
    ""Metals across the board traded lower overnight following yet another round of disappointing
data from China"", he added.

55,145,86e09ca8a894624d25cfc5fc853286bc,Slovenia police resume strike as new government takes over,2018-10-01 17:35:26,EUR,0.74791,2018-10-01 17:35:33,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    LJUBLJANA, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Slovenian police resumed their
strike for higher wages on Monday, less then three weeks after a
new minority centre-left government led by Prime Minister Marjan
Sarec took power following a June parliamentary election.
    The police, who are demanding an average wage increase of
about 15 percent, began their strike in February but suspended
it in March when the previous prime minister resigned, prompting
an early election. [nL8N1Q22L3]
    They sent their demands to the new government a few days
after it was formed but have so far received no reply, Radivoj
Urosevic, the head of the Police Trade Union, told Reuters.
[nL5N1VZ68R]
    ""The position of the police is bad, which is why the number
of policemen in the country is shrinking,"" Urosevic said, adding
that the police would continue to perform all duties necessary
to ensure security in the country.
    By midday on Monday no incidents caused by the police strike
had been reported.
    A number of other trade unions are also demanding higher
wages, including teachers and nurses, and the government last
Thursday formed a team to conduct negotiations with the public
sector trade unions.
    The previous government said earlier this year that all the
trade union wage demands amounted to about one billion euros,
adding that the budget could not cover such wage hikes.
    Slovenia hopes to end 2018 with a budget surplus of about
0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) versus a surplus of
0.03 percent last year.
    ""The government is taking the demands of the police trade
unions and other trade unions very seriously,"" the Ministry of
Public Administration said in a statement on Friday.
    ""The agreement between the government and trade unions is an
absolute priority for the governnment so we are aiming for talks
to begin as soon as possible,"" it added.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - German retail sales fell
unexpectedly for the second month in a row in August and
factories shifted into a lower gear in September, data showed on
Monday, suggesting that Europe's largest economy has lost steam
over the summer.
    Household spending has become a key growth driver in Germany
where consumers benefit from record-high employment, rising real
wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
    But trade disputes abroad and political tensions at home are
both leaving their mark on a still exports-dependent economy
which is now in its ninth year of expansion.
    Retail sales edged down by 0.1 percent on the month in real
terms in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. This was
weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.4 percent
rise and followed a revised drop of 1.1 percent in July.
    On the year, retail rose by 1.6 percent, beating the Reuters
consensus forecast for a 1.5 percent increase and following a
revised 0.9 percent increase in July.
    ""The economic environment for consumption is still
excellent, but many consumers are worried about U.S. tariff
disputes and the many open conflicts in the federal government,""
HDE retail association head Josef Sanktjohanser said.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition has quarrelled
over asylum seekers, immigration and right-wing extremism over
the past months which brought the government close to collapse.
    Sanktjohanser said policymakers must now ensure stability
and dependability at all levels so that consumers would not be
unsettled further by political bickering.
    In a further sign that the economy slowed over the summer, a
survey among purchasing managers in manufacturing showed that
growth eased to a 25-month low in September as new export orders
posted the steepest drop in more than five years. [nL9N1S7029]
    ""It was inevitable that growth would pull back from the high
levels seen last year, but the recent waning of exports has
really taken the wind out of manufacturers' sails in the last
couple of months,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
    He pointed to the escalating trade conflict between the
United States and China, uncertainty surrounding Britain's
planned exit from the EU and Turkey's currency crisis.
    Leading economic institutes said last week they expect
Germany's quarterly growth rate to slow to 0.1 percent in the
third quarter after 0.4 percent in the first and 0.5 percent in
the second. They also blamed bottlenecks in the car industry
caused by new environmental standards for the slowdown.
    The data followed a GfK survey published last week that
showed the mood among German shoppers improved heading into
October, suggesting that consumers will feed growth again in the
fourth quarter despite rising inflation. [nB4N1RA022]

    A COMFORTING PULSE CHECK FROM CENTRAL EUROPE (0953 GMT)
    It's no scientific survey but Baader analysts say they got relatively positive feedback from
the 194 German, Swiss, and Austrian companies which attended their September investment
conference in Munich.
    ""The overall impression we got from the delivered presentations was that most companies
remained rather constructive about the business outlook,"" Baader analysts write. 
    ""Even though several representatives mentioned various challenges and acknowledged that
increasingly protectionist trade policies represent a risk, most managers remained optimistic to
overcome recent macro or operational headwinds over time,"" they add, also noting optimism about
demand growth in the second half of this year.
    Here's how they sum up the business updates they got versus expectations:

    BOUNCEBACK FOR ITALY: WAS FRIDAY AN OVERREACTION? (0914 GMT)
    There's still a healthy debate in the market over what exactly Italy's new budget implies
for the country, and for investors. 
    Today we're seeing a pretty strong bounceback from Italian stocks, up 1.5 percent,
indicating the market is leaning towards a more bullish interpretation. 
    Interestingly Italian bond yields are still rising, though, and the equity bounce is being
driven mostly by Italy's international consumer stocks Fiat Chrysler, Moncler, Ferrari,
Luxottica and Salvatore Ferragamo.
    Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen is one of those who thinks Friday's selloff was overdone.
    ""I don't like the indicated increase in the deficit, but the math just does not justify the
price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!"" writes Nielsen in his Sunday note. 
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the deficit next year to 2.4% of GDP
instead of the widely expected 2.0% of GDP should raise the average funding cost by maybe some 5
to 10 basis points - not by anything like 25-40bp!"" 
    Whether the spread will come back down again will depend on the future path of the budget
from 2020, ratings agencies which may downgrade Italy, and the possibility of President
Mattarella entering the fray, he reckons.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE INCHES UP AS Q4 STARTS (0723 GMT)
    European shares are off to a rather subdued start on the first day of the quarter with main
benchmarks hovering slightly above parity. 
    The NAFTA deal is giving some support and it also seems that Italian equities are attempting
a bounce back following Friday's sell-off on budget expansion worries. 
    ""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade
agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of Q4, and may offer
encouragement that the other global trade disputes can settled satisfactorily,"" says Peel Hunt's
Ian Williams in his daily note.
    An outlook cut from Ryanair however is weighing a bit, dragging down airlines stocks.
Airlines have recently come under pressure on oil prices surging to multi-year highs.

investors take the view that the U.S. trade war dispute with China is far from over.

    ""The FTSE is pointing to a lower start to trading on the opening bell, with miners expected

    ""Metals across the board traded lower overnight following yet another round of disappointing
data from China"", he added.

    * German officials meet later on Monday
    * Government has been split on how to tackle issue

 (Updates with details, background)
    HAMBURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> believes a
hardware retrofit of older diesel cars is not feasible in the
near term, a source at the carmaker said on Monday, ahead of a
German coalition committee meeting on the matter. 
    The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
suppliers were unwilling to assume liability, and that car
manufacturers also rejected guarantees for hardware changes. 
    The positioning comes as the German government and carmakers
try to agree on a deal to avert court bans on older diesel
vehicles from city streets to improve air quality.
    Leaders and senior members of the parties in Chancellor
Angela Merkel's ruling coalition of conservatives and
centre-left Social Democrats meet later on Monday to discuss the
issue.
    A spokesman for Volkswagen said that the company was
prepared to compromise. 
    ""Basically, we're interested in meaningful solutions that
help prevent bans in cities,"" said the spokesman. ""We'll
consider the contribution we can make in due course.""
    Merkel's government has been split on how best to tackle the
problem. Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer has sided with
carmakers in calling for incentives to encourage owners of older
models to trade them in for newer, cleaner ones.
    Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has, meanwhile, called
for hardware retrofits on older models - an option that the
industry says is only feasible in some cases but which would hit
fuel consumption and performance in others. [nL8N1WE2TH]

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): European MMF Reform: September 2018 Dashboard

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10045956

Fitch Ratings-London-October 01: Fitch Ratings says in the latest iteration of 
its European money market fund (MMF) reform dashboard that the successful 
conversion of the first funds augurs well for the wider industry implementation 
of the regulatory reforms. The sector reform kicked off in early September when 
Aviva Investors converted two of its short-term variable net asset value (VNAV) 
funds to low volatility net asset value (LVNAV). The conversion was smooth, with 
negligible movement in fund assets.

 

Multiple other fund providers have announced their post-reform product ranges, 
although conversion dates are now slightly later than initially expected with 
more providers planning on converting funds in early January 2019 than in 4Q18. 
The reforms become effective for existing funds from 21 January 2019.

The ability of euro-denominated LVNAV funds to use reverse distribution 
mechanisms (RDM) to accommodate the prevailing negative yield environment 
remains an uncertainty. While this issue is isolated to euro-denominated funds 
only, it still introduces complexity for euro investors and fund providers. 
Since Fitch's last dashboard, discussions between the EC and ESMA have continued 
on RDM eligibility, although the situation remains unclear.

65,162,dbac8bcafc00e6192635a3d280d7a0bf,GRAPHIC-Slowing growth in CEE manufacturing signals golden days are over,2018-10-01 18:11:16,EUR,-2.01451,2018-10-01 18:12:45,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    By Krisztina  Than and Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Growth in Czech and Polish
manufacturing slowed to almost two-year lows in September and
Hungarian data also showed a slowdown on Monday, signalling that
Central Europe's fast-growing economies are facing bleaker
prospects.
    The region, which has close economic and export links to the
eurozone, primarily to Germany, has been booming in the past
years helped by loose monetary policies. The Hungarian and
Polish central banks still maintain a dovish stance.
    But growth of Germany's manufacturing sector slowed to a
25-month low in September on the steepest drop in new export
orders in more than five years, which does not bode well for the
eastern economies of the European Union. 
    As rising uncertainties amid an escalating trade war between
the United States and China are taking their toll on the German
economy, the latest readings of Purchasing Managers' indices on
Monday showed the Czech PMI reading at its lowest since November
2016 and order growth also at a nearly 2-year low.
    Activity in Polish manufacturing barely grew in September as
new orders fell for the first time in nearly two years.
    The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index for Polish
manufacturing fell to 50.5 in September from 51.4 in August, its
lowest level since October, 2016. It came in below a forecast
for 51.5 in a Reuters poll.
    Hungary's seasonally-adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index
dropped to 53.8 in September from a revised 56 in August.
    The Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory
Management said the figure was below an average reading of 57.1
in the past three Septembers.
    ""The PMIs for Central Europe fell markedly in September.
Most notably, the Polish and Czech surveys plunged to their
weakest levels since late-2016,"" Capital Economics said in a
note.
    ""Manufacturing output has weakened in Germany, and this is
starting to feed through to softer industrial activity in
Central Europe. This supports our forecast that growth across
the region will continue to slow over the coming quarters.""    
    Germany's leading economic institutes last week cut their
2018 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 1.7 percent
from 2.2 percent.
    Hungary's economy, home to big car manufacturing plants of
Daimler and Audi, is expected to slow to 3.5 percent next year
and 3 percent in 2020, from 4.4 percent this year according to
central bank data.
    The Polish economy is projected to slow as well, to 3.8
percent next year from 4.6 percent this year based on central
bank data.
    The Czech economy is expected to grow at a rate of 3.2
percent this year and 3.4 percent next year, according to its
central bank.

foreign exchange reserves, excluding 103.7 tonnes of gold, rose
by 361 million euros to 31.4 billion euros ($36.46 billion) in
September, the bank said on Monday.
    Inflows were 1,418 million euros, mainly representing
changes in credit institutions' foreign currency-denominated
required reserves and inflows into finance ministry's accounts.
    Outflows totalled 1,057 million euros and reflected changes
in credit institutions' foreign currency required reserves,
interest payments and principal repayments on foreign currency
public debt.
    The central bank said October payments to service external
public and publicly guaranteed foreign currency debt amounted to
409 million euros.

    EUROPEAN M&A: YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET (1043 GMT) 
    Law firm CMS has published its European M&A outlook and it suggests dealmaking has scope to
accelerate way further even as Thomson Reuters data shows activity was already up 75 percent as
of September 6.     
    CMS' Mergermarket survey of 170 corporates and 60 private equity firms, who have all
themselves worked on transactions, shows two-thirds of respondents expect activity to increase. 
 
    Here are the survey's key takeaways:

    DAX AT 30,000 IN 2029: ""BUY, HOLD AND SIT TIGHT""! (1014 GMT)
    UniCredit strategist Christian Stocker takes a very long view and says investors would be
better off if they avoided the perils of emotionally-driven short-term moves.
    ""The idea of timing markets may sound seductive but it can be a treacherous strategy for
investors. Those with the discipline to buy, hold and sit tight (and rebalance as necessary)
have been rewarded with a respectable compounding of wealth over long periods,"" he says.
    Stocker says net stock market returns since the 1920s show that those who invested in the
S&P 500 for 20 straight years never lost money, even during such big setbacks such as the Great
Depression, Black Monday, the dotcom bubble and the financial crisis.
    So what could this mean for investors choosing to put money now in the DAX and remain
invested until 2029? They could nearly treble their investment with the German benchmark
currently trading around 12,000 points. 
    ""Even in terms of conservative estimates of economic growth... the DAX might reach 20,000
around 2024 but, after five more years, the DAX might already be at 30,000,"" he says.
    In this UniCredit chart to 2040, you can see the estimated long-term development under
various p/e assumptions for the DAX <.GDAXI> and the Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> indexes.

    A COMFORTING PULSE CHECK FROM CENTRAL EUROPE (0953 GMT)
    It's no scientific survey but Baader analysts say they got relatively positive feedback from
the 194 German, Swiss, and Austrian companies which attended their September investment
conference in Munich.
    ""The overall impression we got from the delivered presentations was that most companies
remained rather constructive about the business outlook,"" Baader analysts write. 
    ""Even though several representatives mentioned various challenges and acknowledged that
increasingly protectionist trade policies represent a risk, most managers remained optimistic to
overcome recent macro or operational headwinds over time,"" they add, also noting optimism about
demand growth in the second half of this year.
    Here's how they sum up the business updates they got versus expectations:

    BOUNCEBACK FOR ITALY: WAS FRIDAY AN OVERREACTION? (0914 GMT)
    There's still a healthy debate in the market over what exactly Italy's new budget implies
for the country, and for investors. 
    Today we're seeing a pretty strong bounceback from Italian stocks, up 1.5 percent,
indicating the market is leaning towards a more bullish interpretation. 
    Interestingly Italian bond yields are still rising, though, and the equity bounce is being
driven mostly by Italy's international consumer stocks Fiat Chrysler, Moncler, Ferrari,
Luxottica and Salvatore Ferragamo.
    Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen is one of those who thinks Friday's selloff was overdone.
    ""I don't like the indicated increase in the deficit, but the math just does not justify the
price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!"" writes Nielsen in his Sunday note. 
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the deficit next year to 2.4% of GDP
instead of the widely expected 2.0% of GDP should raise the average funding cost by maybe some 5
to 10 basis points - not by anything like 25-40bp!"" 
    Whether the spread will come back down again will depend on the future path of the budget
from 2020, ratings agencies which may downgrade Italy, and the possibility of President
Mattarella entering the fray, he reckons.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE INCHES UP AS Q4 STARTS (0723 GMT)
    European shares are off to a rather subdued start on the first day of the quarter with main
benchmarks hovering slightly above parity. 
    The NAFTA deal is giving some support and it also seems that Italian equities are attempting
a bounce back following Friday's sell-off on budget expansion worries. 
    ""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade
agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of Q4, and may offer
encouragement that the other global trade disputes can settled satisfactorily,"" says Peel Hunt's
Ian Williams in his daily note.
    An outlook cut from Ryanair however is weighing a bit, dragging down airlines stocks.
Airlines have recently come under pressure on oil prices surging to multi-year highs.

    ON THE RADAR: M&A AND IPOS AND NO NAFTA EXUBERANCE (0651 GMT) 
    European futures are pointing to an only slightly positive open. Nothing extravagant as
investors take the view that the U.S. trade war dispute with China is far from over.
    Poor macro data from China is also likely to weigh on miners and basic materials, meaning
that the FTSE could actually lose some ground at the open. 
    Among potential movers is France's supermarket retailer Casino, one of the most shorted
stock on the French market, selling property assets for 565 millions euros in a bid to reduce
debt and answers critics such as Muddy Waters.

    There seems to be white smoke coming out of the Nafta negotiations with a Canadian source
confirming a deal, prompting a jump in the Canadian currency. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 43 points higher and Paris' CAC to
rise 21 points on trade war relief.   
    Things are not looking so good for London's FTSE which is seen opening 4 points lower. 
    ""The FTSE is pointing to a lower start to trading on the opening bell, with miners expected
to weigh heavily"", wrote Jasper Lawler, head of research London Capital Group as two surveys
showed on Sunday that growth in China's manufacturing sector sputtered in September.
    ""Metals across the board traded lower overnight following yet another round of disappointing
data from China"", he added.

Seehofer said on Monday some refugees should be allowed to shed
their asylum seeker status if they find a job and learn German,
signalling his readiness to compromise in a coalition dispute
about a new immigration law.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to help companies struggling
with massive labour shortages by lowering the hurdles for
skilled workers from outside the European Union. [nL5N1VY57I]
    But the planned immigration law, due to be discussed at
high-level coalition talks on Monday, risks angering those
voters who feel neglected after Merkel's 2015 decision to admit
more than a million refugees and migrants, mostly Muslims from
the Middle East.
    While a growing number of the refugees are finding jobs, the
process is slow given the urgency of the need for skilled
workers. It takes up to five years for a low-educated Syrian or
Iraqi to learn German and get a professional qualification.
    The coalition parties disagree over whether refugees who are
already living in Germany should be allowed to shed their asylum
status if they have found a job and learned German.
    Seehofer, head of Merkel's more conservative Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), said he had worked out
a compromise deal with Labour Minister Hubertus Heil from the
centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) ahead of Monday's talks.
    Seehofer insisted that asylum seekers whose request had been
rejected would have to leave Germany, regardless of whether they
had found a job and learned German in the meantime.
    However, there should be an exemption for those asylum
seekers who cannot be deported because they would face a threat
such as torture in their home country, Seehofer said.
    ""People say: Before they sit around, let them work,"" said
Seehofer, whose CSU fears losing voters to the far-right in a
regional election later this month.
    Employers' associations and the centre-left SPD want the new
immigration law to include the possibility for refugees to shed
their asylum status once they have found work and learned
German.
    ""It's about preventing a situation where we send back the
right people - and then have to painstakingly search for skilled
workers abroad,"" Heil told Reuters in an interview last month.
    Seehofer had previously opposed the 'Spurwechsel' (lane
change) proposal because he feared it would encourage
immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills.

    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Cooperation agreements for
supervising cross-border asset managers will be in place before
Britain leaves the European Union next March, France's top
markets regulator said on Monday.
    Asset managers are worried that if Britain crashes out of
the EU next March with no transition deal, they would no longer
be able to manage funds listed in the EU under a regime known as
delegation.
    London-based asset managers operate funds listed in
Luxembourg and Dublin holding over a trillion euros of assets
for customers across the bloc.
    Robert Ophele, chairman of France's markets watchdog AMF,
said delegation could only be possible if memoranda of
understanding (MOUs) have been signed between UK and EU
regulators to cooperate in supervision.
    ""This type of MOU is very easy to write. We have them with
many many countries and they all look the same,"" Ophele told a
conference in London organised by financial sector body AFME.
    ""It's my absolute conviction that we will have that in 
force before the Brexit, whatever the Brexit will be,"" Ophele
said. ""It's not a big deal.""
    Industry officials say regulators would likely announce the
MOUs in November or later, once political talks on Britain's EU
divorce settlement, which includes a transition period, have
been concluded.
    France is seen by UK fund managers as trying to curb
delegation in order to put pressure on them to shift senior
managers in Britain to new EU hubs.
    The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
has issued guidelines on how far delegation can go, saying that
the new EU hubs must have ""substance"" or sufficient number of
senior investment staff.
    Ophele said Paris-based ESMA's powers should be bolstered to
avoid national regulators across the EU diverging from centrally
agreed financial rules for asset managers and other sectors.
    National regulators should be forced to say publicly if they
comply with all of ESMA's financial sector guidance, he said.
    Asked if ESMA should become a ""super"" regulator with much
stronger powers like the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Ophele replied, ""In some cases yes, in other cases
not. But it will not happen very rapidly.""

    ITALY'S BUDGET CRISIS: HOW CONTAGIOUS IS IT? (1119 GMT)
    As we mentioned earlier, the Italian budget announcement triggered a sharp selloff on Friday
and today there's a lot of head-scratching as to what the implications of this budget are. 
    Goldman Sachs analysts have modelled the potential contagion to other economies, and
conclude spillover should be limited and shouldn't threaten the growth outlook.
    The contagion effects into the European periphery have (so far) been much smaller than
during 2010 to 2013, they find, and the impact on the euro has been weaker, while the flight to
safety reaction in Bunds has remained steady.
    But rising tensions could have substantial knock-on effects for global markets, particularly
in the euro area (see below their modelled effect of a 100 basis point BTP increase on 10-year
yields and equity prices of European countries, the U.S., and Japan).
    An Italian slowdown would have significant trade effects on the euro area, but not beyond,
GS adds - meaning the possibility for global contagion is likely limited.

    DAX AT 30,000 IN 2029: ""BUY, HOLD AND SIT TIGHT""! (1014 GMT)
    UniCredit strategist Christian Stocker takes a very long view and says investors would be
better off if they avoided the perils of emotionally-driven short-term moves.
    ""The idea of timing markets may sound seductive but it can be a treacherous strategy for
investors. Those with the discipline to buy, hold and sit tight (and rebalance as necessary)
have been rewarded with a respectable compounding of wealth over long periods,"" he says.
    Stocker says net stock market returns since the 1920s show that those who invested in the
S&P 500 for 20 straight years never lost money, even during such big setbacks such as the Great
Depression, Black Monday, the dotcom bubble and the financial crisis.
    So what could this mean for investors choosing to put money now in the DAX and remain
invested until 2029? They could nearly treble their investment with the German benchmark
currently trading around 12,000 points. 
    ""Even in terms of conservative estimates of economic growth... the DAX might reach 20,000
around 2024 but, after five more years, the DAX might already be at 30,000,"" he says.
    In this UniCredit chart to 2040, you can see the estimated long-term development under
various p/e assumptions for the DAX <.GDAXI> and the Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> indexes.

    A COMFORTING PULSE CHECK FROM CENTRAL EUROPE (0953 GMT)
    It's no scientific survey but Baader analysts say they got relatively positive feedback from
the 194 German, Swiss, and Austrian companies which attended their September investment
conference in Munich.
    ""The overall impression we got from the delivered presentations was that most companies
remained rather constructive about the business outlook,"" Baader analysts write. 
    ""Even though several representatives mentioned various challenges and acknowledged that
increasingly protectionist trade policies represent a risk, most managers remained optimistic to
overcome recent macro or operational headwinds over time,"" they add, also noting optimism about
demand growth in the second half of this year.

    BOUNCEBACK FOR ITALY: WAS FRIDAY AN OVERREACTION? (0914 GMT)
    There's still a healthy debate in the market over what exactly Italy's new budget implies
for the country, and for investors. 
    Today we're seeing a pretty strong bounceback from Italian stocks, up 1.5 percent,
indicating the market is leaning towards a more bullish interpretation. 
    Interestingly Italian bond yields are still rising, though, and the equity bounce is being
driven mostly by Italy's international consumer stocks Fiat Chrysler, Moncler, Ferrari,
Luxottica and Salvatore Ferragamo.
    Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen is one of those who thinks Friday's selloff was overdone.
    ""I don't like the indicated increase in the deficit, but the math just does not justify the
price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!"" writes Nielsen in his Sunday note. 
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the deficit next year to 2.4% of GDP
instead of the widely expected 2.0% of GDP should raise the average funding cost by maybe some 5
to 10 basis points - not by anything like 25-40bp!"" 
    Whether the spread will come back down again will depend on the future path of the budget
from 2020, ratings agencies which may downgrade Italy, and the possibility of President
Mattarella entering the fray, he reckons.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE INCHES UP AS Q4 STARTS (0723 GMT)
    European shares are off to a rather subdued start on the first day of the quarter with main
benchmarks hovering slightly above parity. 
    The NAFTA deal is giving some support and it also seems that Italian equities are attempting
a bounce back following Friday's sell-off on budget expansion worries. 
    ""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade
agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of Q4, and may offer
encouragement that the other global trade disputes can settled satisfactorily,"" says Peel Hunt's
Ian Williams in his daily note.
    An outlook cut from Ryanair however is weighing a bit, dragging down airlines stocks.

investors take the view that the U.S. trade war dispute with China is far from over.

driven mostly by Italy's international consumer stocks Fiat Chrysler, Moncler, Ferrari,
Luxottica and Salvatore Ferragamo.
    Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen is one of those who thinks Friday's selloff was overdone.
    ""I don't like the indicated increase in the deficit, but the math just does not justify the
price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!"" writes Nielsen in his Sunday note. 
    ""Roughly speaking, based on history, an increase in the deficit next year to 2.4% of GDP
instead of the widely expected 2.0% of GDP should raise the average funding cost by maybe some 5
to 10 basis points - not by anything like 25-40bp!"" 
    Whether the spread will come back down again will depend on the future path of the budget
from 2020, ratings agencies which may downgrade Italy, and the possibility of President
Mattarella entering the fray, he reckons.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE INCHES UP AS Q4 STARTS (0723 GMT)
    European shares are off to a rather subdued start on the first day of the quarter with main
benchmarks hovering slightly above parity. 
    The NAFTA deal is giving some support and it also seems that Italian equities are attempting
a bounce back following Friday's sell-off on budget expansion worries. 
    ""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade
agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of Q4, and may offer
encouragement that the other global trade disputes can settled satisfactorily,"" says Peel Hunt's
Ian Williams in his daily note.

    * VW among brands seen pricing aggressively
    * Concerns mount over profitability

    By Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive
en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car
launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.
  
    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
    Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this
week, from PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> electric DS3 Crossback to the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> EQC, will erode profitability as they
struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
    But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as
consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing
carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
    ""What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is
like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares,
chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
    A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW <BMWG.DE>, blamed in part
on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a
first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
    ""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put
the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
    Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime
Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding
a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as
the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to
cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by
2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal
many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of
fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    
    PRICED TO PUSH
    After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions
are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from
diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides
and particulates, but less CO2. [nL8N1QK23C]
    Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and
faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled
emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises
more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has said the ID hatchback, due to
open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced
close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
    ""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the
same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent
Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
    ""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been
factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay
penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the
market going.""
    Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want
our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably
equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
    Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them
have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification
investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
    They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more
electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by
California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches
are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
        
    COST GAP
    Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on
average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in
hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a
combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
    When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
    Mass-market electrics such as the Renault <RENA.PA> Zoe and
Nissan <7201.T> Leaf have been on sale for most of the current
decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla <TSLA.O>
has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric
cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
    Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already
priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker
acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
    Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close
to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
[nL8N1VQ0ZG]
    ""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the
industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley
Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify
investment at all - it's all regulation.""
    Which is why, on this subject more than most, European
carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives
exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their
Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the
region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
    ""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't
met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA
Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
    
    SCALE EFFECTS
    Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in
recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
    Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But
lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric
car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will
pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
    Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies
are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives
have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. [nL8N1WD2U9]
    Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK
market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition
to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
    French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to
match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat
told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the
carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
    ""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,""
Salvat said.
    German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which
includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on
electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their
biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
    That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and
Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric
cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
    ""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW
research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
    ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

    By Maria Sheahan and Jan Schwartz
    BERLIN/HAMBURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - German carmakers are
willing to bear most of the cost of upgrading old diesel cars to
reduce urban air pollution, Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer
said ahead of make-or-break coalition talks on the issue on
Monday.
    A way still needs to be found to cover the rest of the cost
without drivers having to foot the bill, Scheuer added, as the
clock ticked down on a deadline to find a solution to avert
driving bans in several cities.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Germany's largest carmaker, has
agreed to cover 2,400 euros ($2,780) of the estimated 3,000-euro
cost of hardware retrofits on its diesel cars, Scheuer said on a
live video chat on Instagram.
    ""Now we have to discuss in the coalition how we handle the
gap of 600 euros,"" he added.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition was due to
convene on Monday evening to finalise a plan after a rocky few
weeks that has seen support slide to all-time lows for both her
conservative party and its Social Democrat (SPD) partners.
    Her government has been split on how best to tackle the
problem, with Scheuer siding with carmakers in also calling for
incentives to encourage owners of older models to trade them in
for newer, cleaner ones. [nL8N1WE2TH]
    Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, an SPD member,
meanwhile favours hardware retrofits - an option the industry
says is only feasible in some models and which would fuel
consumption and performance in others.
    A compromise is likely to feature both, with Scheuer saying
Volkswagen was willing to offer trade-in deals worth up to 8,000
euros, BMW <BMWG.DE> 6,000 euros and Daimler 5,000 euros, as
well as leasing options.
    NO COST TO DRIVERS
    Scheuer also said his Christian Social Union, the Bavarian
sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats - did not want
diesel drivers to face any additional expense.
    The SPD's Schulze said a deal must include hardware upgrades
and that the entire cost should be borne by the industry: ""The
car industry caused the problem, and now they have to fix it,""
she told SWR Radio in an interview.
    Volkswagen's admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel
emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from
several manufacturers routinely exceed pollution limits in
normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown.
    At the same time, the German courts have paved the way for
city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed
European safety levels. The first, in financial capital
Frankfurt, is due to take effect next February. [nL3N1W54AN]
    Asked about the time range in which the exchange premiums
would be offered, Scheuer said this would vary: ""I have very
good messages. For example, BMW wants to start immediately,
already in October, November and this will continue for one
year,"" he said.
    Volkswagen doubts that hardware retrofits on older diesels
are technically feasible and is only willing to foot the bill if
it does not have to bear liability for any engine damage that
may result, a company source said.
    This person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
suppliers were unwilling to assume liability, and that car
manufacturers also rejected guarantees for hardware changes. 
    A spokesman for Volkswagen said the company was prepared to

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Warsaw/London-October 01: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Poland-based 
ENEA S.A.'s Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) 
at 'BBB' with Stable Outlooks. 

The affirmation reflects ENEA's changed business profile with a higher 
contribution to EBITDA from more risky electricity generation and coal mining, 
but still significant input from the more predictable distribution of 
electricity. We anticipate that rising CO2 and coal prices will have only a 
limited impact on results of the generation business as we expect them to be 
reflected in rising wholesale electricity prices in the Polish market. 

We deem ENEA's involvement in the 1GW coal-fired power plant Ostroleka C project 
as credit negative. However, with ENEA's expected participation of about PLN1 
billion, which we assume will be offset by suspension of dividends by 2022, our 
funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage should stay below the negative 
rating guideline of 3.0x.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Changed Business Profile: ENEA's business profile has changed following the 
acquisition of power generation company ENGIE Energia Polska S.A. (ENGIE Poland) 
in 2017 and Bogdanka coal mine in 2015, which increased the scale of the 
generation business and expanded ENEA's value chain to coal mining. Together 
with the commencement of operations at the new 1GW coal-fired block in Kozienice 
in 4Q17 and the rising prices of coal, both the generation and mining divisions 
have been reporting higher EBITDA and increased their share in the mix.  

Distribution Supports Credit Profile: ENEA's credit profile continues to benefit 
from the stable and predictable electricity distribution business, which is 
characterised by lower business risk than conventional generation and mining. 
The share in EBITDA (40% in 2018) has decreased compared with the 2014 peak of 
close to 60% due to ENEA's expansion in conventional generation and mining. We 
anticipate that the distribution segment's share in EBITDA will remain at about 
40% over our rating horizon, supporting ENEA's credit profile. 

Rising CO2 and Coal Prices: We expect that ENEA's coal-fired generation business 
will come under limited pressure from rising CO2 and coal prices. This is due to 
the low interconnectivity of the Polish market and domination of coal-fired 
generation in the country's fuel mix. Consequently, higher generation costs 
affect most of the market and are reflected in rising wholesale electricity 
prices. We expect this pass-through effect to gradually weaken, but only in the 
long term. Wholesale electricity prices have been increasing, even in the 
typically lower-price markets like Germany and Scandinavia, hence imports, even 
if technically possible, would be less competitive.

ENEA benefits from partial allocation of free CO2 allowances in exchange for 
environment-friendly capex similarly to many other central European generation 
companies. We currently assume that the mechanism will not be extended beyond 
2020. The key risk mitigant on the coal pricing side is ownership of a low 
production cost coal mine, Bogdanka, and ability to benefit from increasing coal 
prices through the mining division.  

Ostroleka C Project: ENEA will likely participate in the construction of the new 
coal-fired block in Ostroleka with Energa S.A. (BBB/Stable). The exact structure 
of the project is unknown yet, but both ENEA and Energa declared that their 
stakes in the project would not exceed PLN1 billion each with another up to PLN1 
billion likely to be provided by a local investment fund managed by TFI Energia. 
The remainder (about PLN3 billion) could be provided either in form of equity or 
non-recourse debt by investors at the project company level. In Fitch's rating 
case we assume that ENEA will contribute PLN1 billion to the project in form of 
equity. A higher contribution would be negative for ENEA's credit profile and 
could lead to negative rating action.  

Ostroleka C Risks: Participation in the Ostroleka C project would further 
increase ENEA's exposure to generation business, which is negative for its 
credit profile. However, some mitigants exist, including implementation of the 
project in partnership with Energa and other third-party financial investors, 
introduction of a capacity market in Poland with first capacity auctions planned 
for late 2018 and a favourable coal price formula in the supply contract with 
domestic coal mining group Polska Grupa Gornicza (PGG), supporting the margin on 
power generation.

Capacity Market Crucial: We view the capacity market in Poland as crucial in 
allowing new coal power plants under construction or in the planning stage, such 
as the Ostroleka C plant, to be operationally profitable and to provide a return 
on invested capital. ENEA's ratings would come under pressure if the Ostroleka C 
project was implemented without capacity payments supporting cash flow and 
consequently without the support of financial investors. 

High, but Manageable Leverage: In our rating case we assume no dividends over 
2019-2022 (similarly to 2018 when the company did not pay dividends) and include 
cash outflows for the Ostroleka C project of about PLN1 billion. We expect 
relatively high capex and acquisitions, including Ostroleka C, at close to PLN13 
billion over 2018-2022. Consequently, we expect FFO adjusted net leverage to 
increase and average 2.8x over 2018-2022 (2.5x in 2017). This is below the 
negative rating guideline of 3x, but leaves limited rating headroom.

Rated on Standalone Basis: We assess ENEA's links with the Polish state 
(A-/Stable), which owns 51.5% of the company, under our Government-Related 
Entities (GRE) rating criteria. Based on these criteria, ENEA is rated on a 
standalone basis, which is the same approach as under the parent and subsidiary 
rating linkage criteria. Under the GRE criteria, we assess status, ownership and 
control as strong with the three remaining factors as weak, including support 
track record and expectations, socio-political impact and financial implications 
of ENEA's hypothetical default.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

ENEA has a lower share of regulated distribution than the two other 'BBB' rated 
Polish integrated utilities, TAURON Polska Energia S.A. (Tauron, BBB/Stable) and 
Energa, and a higher exposure to more risky and cyclical mining division. This 
is reflected in Fitch's lower maximum leverage guideline within the ratings of 
3.0x for ENEA and 3.5x for Tauron and Energa. 

The largest Polish utility PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. (BBB+/Stable) has 
a high share of lignite in its generation fuel mix, which has let the company 
achieve cost advantage over its hard coal-fired Polish peers. Rising CO2 prices 
could diminish this cost advantage if not accompanied by rising hard coal 
prices, due to higher carbon footprint of lignite when compared to hard coal. 
PGE has also the lowest leverage among Fitch-rated electricity-utilities in 
Poland.

All four Polish integrated utilities have limited rating headroom due to a 
projected increase in leverage driven by large capex and changing market 
conditions.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

 Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer

- Weighted average cost of capital in the distribution segment at 6.0% in 
2018-2022

- 5% reduction in the return on the distribution's regulated asset base from 
2018

- Wholesale electricity prices rising from about PLN200 to PLN250 per 
megawatt-hour, coal prices rising from about PLN200 to PLN300 per tonne and 
prices of carbon dioxide allowances rising from about EUR15 to EUR20 per tonne 
over 2018-2022 (all prices on an average, annual basis)

- Reduced margins in the supply business to ease impact of higher wholesale 
electricity prices, in particular on households    

- Total capex and acquisitions of close to PLN13 billion over 2018-2022, 
including PLN1 billion as investment in the Ostroleka C project

- No dividends paid by ENEA over 2018-2022

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Rating upside potential for ENEA is limited due to the company's large capex and 
acquisition plans, business risk profile including a large portion of mining and 
changing market conditions in the generation business as well as our expectation 
that FFO adjusted net leverage will increase to close to 3x limit for the 
ratings. However, future developments that could lead to positive rating action 
include:

- Stronger-than-expected cash flow generation or reduction of capex and 
acquisition plans leading to projected FFO adjusted net leverage sustained below 
2x, supported by management's more conservative leverage target; 

- A more diversified fuel generation mix and lower CO2 emissions per 
megawatt-hour, which together with continued efficiency improvements, would 
result in a stronger business profile.

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- Increase in FFO adjusted net leverage to above 3x or FFO fixed charge cover 
below 5x on a sustained basis due, for example, to full implementation of the 
capex plan or acquisitions in a scenario of low operating cash flows; 

- Substantial adverse change in ENEA's business profile, such as a material 
reduction in the share of regulated distribution in total EBITDA or higher 
generation costs not reflected in wholesale electricity prices;

- Involvement in Ostroleka C project construction phase without secured cash 
flow support from the capacity market and without the involvement of financial 
investors, or in a scenario of large dividends paid to shareholders.

LIQUIDITY

Adequate Liquidity: At end-June 2018 ENEA had unrestricted cash of PLN2.8 
billion and committed unused credit lines of PLN1.0 billion against short-term 
debt of PLN0.5 billion, Fitch-projected negative free cash flow including 
acquisitions of PLN0.4 billion (negative) for 2018 and PLN0.9 billion (negative) 
for 2019. 

The next large debt repayments are scheduled for 2020, when about PLN2 billion 
of bank-tailored and market bonds mature. We expect ENEA to begin the process of 
refinancing at least 12 months in advance of the maturity dates.

 (Adds foreign carmakers, retrofit suppliers)
    By Maria Sheahan and Jan Schwartz
    BERLIN/HAMBURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - German carmakers are
willing to bear most of the cost of upgrading old diesel cars to
reduce air pollution in the country's cities, Transport Minister
Andreas Scheuer said ahead of make-or-break coalition talks on
the issue on Monday.
    A way still needs to be found to cover the rest of the cost
without drivers having to foot the bill, Scheuer added, as the
clock ticked down on a deadline to find a solution to avert
driving bans in several cities.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Germany's largest carmaker, has
agreed to cover 2,400 euros ($2,780) of the estimated 3,000-euro
cost of hardware retrofits on its diesel cars, Scheuer said on a
live video chat on Instagram.
    ""Now we have to discuss in the coalition how we handle the
gap of 600 euros,"" he added.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition was due to
convene on Monday evening to finalise a plan after a rocky few
weeks that has seen support slide to all-time lows for both her
conservative party and its Social Democrat (SPD) partners.
    Her government has been split on how best to tackle the
problem, with Scheuer siding with carmakers in also calling for
incentives to encourage owners of older models to trade them in
for newer, cleaner ones. [nL8N1WE2TH]
    Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, an SPD member,
meanwhile favours hardware retrofits - an option the industry
says is only feasible in some models and which would hit fuel
consumption and performance in others.
    A compromise is likely to feature both, with Scheuer saying
Volkswagen was willing to offer trade-in deals worth up to 8,000
euros, BMW <BMWG.DE> 6,000 euros and Daimler up to 5,000 euros,
as well as leasing options.
    One complaint of German carmakers is that foreign rivals
would not be covered by any requirement for retrofits. Volvo of
Sweden said it was not working on any such upgrades, but is
looking at incentives to encourage customers to trade in diesels
for newer, cleaner cars. [nS8N1VX02G]
    That option is also being considered by several foreign
carmakers, said Reinhard Zirpel, head of the VDIK car importers'
association. ""We have legal, technical and business reservations
about hardware upgrades,"" he told the Tagesspiegel daily.
    
    NO COST TO DRIVERS
    Scheuer also said his Christian Social Union, the Bavarian
sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats - did not want
diesel drivers to face any additional expense.
    The SPD's Schulze said a deal must include hardware upgrades
and that the entire cost should be borne by the industry: ""The
car industry caused the problem, and now they have to fix it,""
she told SWR Radio in an interview.
    Volkswagen's admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel
emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from
several manufacturers routinely exceed pollution limits in
normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown.
    At the same time, the German courts have paved the way for
city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed
European safety levels. The first, in financial capital
Frankfurt, is due to take effect next February. [nL3N1W54AN]
    Volkswagen doubts that hardware retrofits on older diesels
are technically feasible and is only willing to foot the bill if
it does not have to bear liability for any engine damage that
may result, a company source said.
    That shouldn't be an obstacle to a solution, according to
suppliers of catalytic converters - devices that can be
installed in cars to convert harmful exhaust pollutants into
less harmful gases.
    ""This was never an issue. Of course we assume responsibility
for the liability and maintenance of the product that we
install,"" said Stefan Lefarth, director of strategy and product
innovation at HJS Emission Technology.

its 2019 draft budget to parliament on Monday evening, aiming to
outperform its primary surplus targets for a fifth year and
avoid implementing painful pension cuts agreed with creditors.
    Greece emerged from an international bailout in August.
    The government has promised its international lenders it
will achieve a primary budget surplus, excluding debt servicing
outlays, of least 3.5 percent of economic output up to 2022. 
    Hinging on its fiscal outpeformance, Athens hopes its euro
zone lenders will allow it to skip pension cuts scheduled to
kick in next year, when the left-right coalition government's
term expires.
    In its first post-bailout budget, Athens is also expected to
project economic growth of about 2.5 percent next year, Prime
Minister Alexis Tsipras said last week. The economy is seen
growing by 2.1 percent this year.  
    ""Today's fiscal environment and the Greek government's
intention to proceed with fiscal interventions which will
prevent cutting pensions will be reflected in the draft budget,""
government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters.
    Tzanakopoulos said talks with the EU Commission on freezing
pension cuts were progressing ""on good terms"". 
    Solving this issue amicably is crucial as the country is
closely monitored by markets and any sign of fiscal deviation
may plunge it back into crisis.   
    ""Some common ground will be found with the Commission, since
it is self-evident that the 3.5 percent primary surplus can be
achieved without implementing the fiscal measure of pension
cuts,"" he said.
    In the meantime, the government is likely to submit a draft
budget which will include fiscal scenarios rather than clarity 
on whether it will implement the cuts. 
    Greece has also promised to hand out a social dividend to
those hit hardest during the debt crisis which broke out in
2010. But the exact amount to be spent will be decided after
deliberations with the EU Commission, Tzanakopoulos said.
    Last month, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras used a keynote
policy speech in the northern city of Thessaloniki to announce a
spending spree that he said would help fix the ills of years of
belt-tightening and boost growth.[L5N1VU0ON]
    Greece will submit its final 2019 budget in mid-November.

    By Francesca Landini
    MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italian coffee maker Lavazza will
swallow the coffee business of U.S. food giant Mars Inc to
expand its global reach, in a deal worth around $650 million,
including debt.
    The two unlisted companies said on Monday that Lavazza had
agreed to buy Mars Drinks, a business that includes Flavia and
Klinx systems, two leading brands in the office coffee service
(OCS) and vending machine segments. 
    The groups did not disclose the financial details, but a
source close to the matter told Reuters the deal points to an
enterprise value for Mars Drinks of around $650 million.
    BNP Paribas, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit provided a 400
million euro ($463 million) loan to the coffee maker for the
deal, the source said. 
    ""This acquisition strengthens Lavazza's position in the OCS
and vending segments, which offer considerable opportunities for
growth and development,"" said Antonio Baravalle, Lavazza CEO.
    The Italian group was advised by J.P. Morgan, Cleary
Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, PwC and The Boston Consulting Group. 
    Mars Inc, which makes M&M's chocolate candies and Wrigley's
gum, was advised by BofA Merrill Lynch, Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer LLP, KPMG LLP and Rabo Securities USA.
    The acquisition follows the purchase of Australia's Blue Pod
Coffee announced by Lavazza last July and comes after a handful
of deals the Italian group struck between 2015 and 2017 to boost
its revenue above 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).
    Lavazza, founded in 1895 by Luigi Lavazza in the northern
Italian city of Turin, is the market leader in Italy and is
privately owned by the founding family.
    The deal comes amid an acquisitions spree in the global
coffee sector which has seen Coca-Cola <KO.N> acquiring coffee
chain Costa from Britain's Whitbread <WTB.L> for $5.1 billion in
August and Nestle <NESN.S> agreeing a $7 billion licensing deal
for Starbucks's <SBUX.O> retail business earlier this year.
[nL8N1VM10W] 
    Under the agreement, which is expected to close by the end
of this year, Lavazza will acquire Mars' coffee businesses in
North America, Canada, Japan and in Europe, including its
production plants in Britain and North America.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain's departure from the
European Union next March will force a full review of the bloc's
sweeping new rules for markets, including tougher market-access
conditions for foreign trading platforms, a top French regulator
said on Monday.
    Robert Ophele, chairman of France's AMF markets watchdog,
said Brexit will force the EU to undertake a complete review of
the so-called MiFID II rules.
    ""I don't think there is a need for a major overhaul of
MiFID, but clearly there are some quick fixes, some elements
that should be adapted,"" Ophele told a conference held by AFME,
a banking industry body.
    The MiFID rules, which run to hundreds of pages, were only
introduced in January, a year late, because of the complexity
and the cost for trading firms, banks and even regulators to
implement them.
    France is actively courting banks based in Britain that are
opening EU hubs to avoid Brexit disruption, hoping they will
base their trading operations in Paris.
    Ophele said legislative fixes were needed to stop market
participants circumventing the rules and to improve the quality
of transaction data.
    ""MiFID II may be a complex piece of law, but that does not
mean we should shy away from re-opening it and fixing
deficiencies where evidence may show that we have gone too far
or have generated unintended consequences,"" Ophele told an
industry event in London.
    MiFID II has introduced caps on trading shares in the ""dark""
or away from transparent platforms like stock exchanges, but
Brexit will mean that much of that trading will no longer be in
the bloc.
    ""In the light of this, it makes sense to question whether
MiFID II's quantitative calibrations will be relevant tomorrow
when the UK is no longer in the EU,"" Ophele said.
    
    TOUGHER EQUIVALENCE
    Waivers from MiFID rules affecting commodities trading will
also need to be revisited given that nearly all metals, oil and
coal derivatives are traded in London, Ophele said.
    MiFID allows trading firms based outside the EU to serve
customers in the bloc if their home rules are aligned or
""equivalent"" to the bloc's own regulation.
    Ophele said that foreign firms should be made to comply with
more of MiFID's reporting and trading obligations for
derivatives and shares in order to qualify, dashing UK hopes of
an easing of the equivalence regime.
    Separately on Monday, the EU's securities watchdog ESMA
published a letter dated Sept. 26 to the European Commission
that also called for tougher application of MiFID to non-EU
firms that serve investors in the bloc.
    So-called reverse solicitation, or where a non-EU firm is
allowed to serve an EU customer that had initiated the initial
contact, should also be reviewed, ESMA said. 
    MiFID ""does not ensure a consistent and convergent level of
protection to investors interacting with third country firms"",
ESMA added.
    Brussels will only decide if a foreign firm is equivalent if
it has cooperation agreements with its regulator. Ophele said
firms should assume there will be such an agreement between
supervisors in the EU and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.

    By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday as
a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact lifted some of the gloom
over global trade, while Italian stocks extended Friday's slide
as top EU officials weighed in on the government's budget plans.
    There was no shortage of corporate news to drive the markets
either, with Ryanair taking a 12.5 percent dive after a profit
warning, Fresenius boosted by a ruling in its favour, and Linde
rising on a regulator's green light for its merger with Praxair.
    The euro zone's top stock index <.STOXX50E> rose 0.4 percent
while Germany's trade-sensitive DAX <.GDAXI> climbed 0.8
percent.
    ""News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and
Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade agreement should give a boost
to global risk appetite at the start of the fourth quarter,""
wrote Peel Hunt strategist Ian Williams, adding the deal ""may
offer encouragement that the other global trade disputes can be
settled satisfactorily"".
    Ryanair <RYA.I> was the worst performer, down 7.5 percent 
after it cut its forecast for full-year profit and said there
could be worse to come if recent coordinated strikes across
Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings. [nL8N1WH1EH]
    The fall in Europe's largest low-cost carrier weighed on the
wider sector <.SXTP> which fell 0.5 percent.
    Peers Easyjet <EZJ.L>, Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> and British
Airways owner IAG <ICAG.L> were down 4.1 percent, 2.6 percent
and 1.4 percent  respectively. 
    While the overall market gained, Italian shares were still
on tenterhooks in the fallout of the government's decision to
increase its deficit target, while Italy's government bond
yields climbed higher.
    Starting the day as the strongest gainer, the FTSE MIB
reversed course to finish down 0.6 percent with Italian banks
<.FTIT8300> extending Friday's fall by another 3.1 percent. 
    The Vice President of the European Commission Valdis
Dombrovskis said its initial view was that the Italian budget
plans break EU rules. [nS8N1VJ00U]
    ""Tria went there to reassure but intial comments from
Moscovici and Dombrovskis are not positive,"" said Carlo
Franchini, head of institutional clients at Banca Ifigest in
Milan.   
    Euro zone banks <.SX7E> also felt the strain, down another
1.2 percent and the worst-performing sector.
    Among gainers, Fresenius <FREG.DE> shares topped the STOXX
with an 8.3 percent gain after a Delaware judge ruled the German
healthcare group could walk away from its $4.75 billion deal for
U.S. drugmaker Akorn Inc <AKRX.O> and rejected Akorn's claim
that the merger agreement had been breached. [nL2N1WH0GO]
    Germany's Linde <LING.DE> jumped 6.2 percent after it
received approval for its proposed $83 billion merger with
Praxair <PX.N> from the Chinese antitrust authorities.
[nL8N1WH1NC]
    French supermarket group Casino <CASP.PA> inched up 0.1
percent after it said it had agreed to sell some property assets
for 565 million euros ($655 million) to reduce debt levels that
have worried investors. [nL8N1WH0MT]

aim for a primary budget surplus, excluding debt servicing

 (Adds Valeo CEO comment)
    By Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive
en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car
launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.
  
    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
    Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this
week, from PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> electric DS3 Crossback to the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> EQC, will erode profitability as they
struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
    But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as
consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing
carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
    ""What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is
like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares,
chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
    A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW <BMWG.DE>, blamed in part
on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a
first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
    ""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put
the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
    Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime
Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding
a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as
the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to
cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by
2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal
many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of
fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    
    PRICED TO PUSH
    After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions
are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from
diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides
and particulates, but less CO2. [nL8N1QK23C]
    Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and
faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled
emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises
more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has said the ID hatchback, due to
open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced
close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
    ""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the
same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent
Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
    ""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been
factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay
penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the
market going.""
    Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want
our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably
equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
    Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them
have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification
investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
    They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more
electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by
California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches
are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
        
    COST GAP
    Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on
average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in
hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a
combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
    When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
    Mass-market electrics such as the Renault <RENA.PA> Zoe and
Nissan <7201.T> Leaf have been on sale for most of the current
decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla <TSLA.O>
has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric
cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
    Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already
priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker
acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
    Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close
to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
[nL8N1VQ0ZG]
    ""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the
industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley
Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify
investment at all - it's all regulation.""
    Which is why, on this subject more than most, European
carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives
exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their
Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the
region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
    ""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't
met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA
Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
    Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.
    ""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich,
chief executive of Valeo <VLOF.PA>, a major manufacturer of
electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot
even though the market doesn't exist.""
        
    SCALE EFFECTS
    Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in
recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
    Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But
lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric
car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will
pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
    Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies
are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives
have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. [nL8N1WD2U9]
    Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK
market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition
to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
    French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to
match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat
told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the
carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
    ""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,""
Salvat said.
    German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which
includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on
electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their
biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
    That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and
Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric
cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
    ""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW
research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
    ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Brexit minister
Dominic Raab said on Monday Britain was looking at how
regulatory checks on some goods could be used as part of a
solution to move Brexit talks, notably a ""backstop deal"" for the
Irish border, forward.
    But he repeated that any such deal to prevent the return of

would have to be time-limited.
    Raab described a media report that had said the government
was preparing to back down on customs checks between mainland
Britain and Northern Ireland as ""overspeculating"". [nL4N1WH3OH]
    London has indicated that it may consider options on 
regulations on the island of Ireland, noting that there are
already some different rules for agriculture and food products
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
    But it was not clear whether the government would tolerate
such a difference for manufactured goods.
    Raab told an event on the sidelines of the Conservative
Party conference in Birmingham: ""Our number one priority is
making sure we don't see a border down the Irish sea that will
carve up economically the United Kingdom,"" Raab said.
    ""We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs backstop
and on the regulatory side of things, we have been clear that we
will, as long as we can carry the communities of Northern
Ireland with us, we will be open to be looking at some of the
options on regulatory checks.""
    He also said he welcomed EU chief negotiator Michel
Barnier's suggestion that technology could help resolve the
border issue.

    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain cannot be
bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening
the government's criticism of the European Union for taunting
Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks.
    May's ministers have come out one by one at their party's
annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that
they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to
show ""respect"" in the talks to end Britain's membership.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the
country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than
40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not
only in her governing party but also in Brussels.
    Party unity is on British ministers' minds, and they are
encouraging the faithful to direct their anger at the EU rather
than at their prime minister, who some eurosceptic Conservatives
accuse of leading Britain towards a ""Brexit in name only"".
    But the new strident tone has annoyed many in Brussels,
especially when foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the bloc
to the Soviet Union, the master of several states in eastern
Europe which saw membership of the EU as a measure of their
freedom. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond,
have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a
deal could hurt Britain's economy, the world's fifth largest.
    But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the ""ambition
and pragmatism"" Britain had put forward with May's Chequers
proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement
with her ministers was hashed out in July.
    ""Unfortunately, that wasn't on display in Salzburg,"" he
said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where
EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan.
    ""Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In
return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly
one-sided approach to negotiation.""
    ""What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British
government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of
economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our
country's interests,"" Raab said, later calling again on the EU
to move their position and meet Britain half way.
    Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg
summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the
atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt
May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit.
    
    ""NO CHERRIES""
    A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing
him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: ""A piece
of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries"" ""certainly had an impact"",
one official said.
    With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any
future relationship, the possibility of a ""no deal Brexit"" has
increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a
worst case scenario.
    ""The world is watching,"" said Matthew Fell, chief UK policy
director at the Confederation of British Industry. 
    ""Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the
tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of
agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills
would be hugely helpful,"" he told Reuters.
    But one source close to the government said there was now a
sense that the EU had realised that the tone set in Salzburg was
""perhaps a bit off"" and, behind the scenes, conversations
between the two sides were more constructive.
    Raab later said the government was open to looking at
regulatory checks to try to ease talks on a so-called backstop
to prevent a return to a hard border between the British
province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - one of the
outstanding issues yet to be agreed. [nS8N1JB023]
    Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance.
    After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still ""be neighbours
and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,"" he
told the conference, again backing May's Chequers plan.
    ""Mr Tusk says it won't work. But that's what people said
about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.""
    But Hunt's popular line at conference, that the EU was
acting like the Soviet Union, did little to soothe relations,
provoking those eastern members of the bloc which only regained
full independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. They joined the EU more than a decade later.
    Lithuania's EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt
he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed
by the Soviet KGB state security agency.
    ""Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and
Soviet Union,"" he said. ""Anytime. Whatever helps.""
    But back in Birmingham, it was Raab, winning a standing
ovation for his story about his father's journey from then
Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion, who summed up Britain's
new combative stance.
    ""The EU's theological approach allows no room for serious
compromise,"" he said. ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get
serious.""

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - British finance
minister Philip Hammond said on Monday  rebalancing trade with
the EU was a delicate process which should be done gradually,
and that product standards should stay the same after Brexit.
    ""We have to be very, very careful and we need a very, very
gradual process of rebalancing our trade between Europe and the
rest of the world,"" Hammond said at an event at the Conservative

    ""Pulling the rug away from a very large part of our export

replace it would be highly dangerous.""
    Hammond said goods regulation in the EU had been stable for
the last two decades therefore was relatively easy for British
firms to stick with. 
    However, he was ""much, much more sceptical"" about adopting
EU standards on financial services.
    ""This is a fast-developing area that could move in a
direction that was very difficult for us,"" he said.

    By Lefteris Papadimas and George Georgiopoulos
    ATHENS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Greece on Monday unveiled next
year's budget draft, aiming to attain a bigger primary surplus
than that agreed with its international creditors, projecting
that economic growth will pick up to 2.5 percent.
    In what will be the first budget with the country out of
bailout programmes, the government aims to outperform on primary
surplus targets for a fifth straight year to be in a position to
avoid implementing painful pension cuts agreed with creditors.
    Athens emerged from an international bailout in August.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pitched rescinding unpopular
pension cuts slated for January as part of relief measures,
claiming there is ample fiscal space to do so.
    The government, which has promised its euro zone lenders and
the International Monetary Fund it will achieve a 3.5 percent of
GDP primary budget surplus excluding debt servicing outlays, is
targeting a surplus of 4.14 percent next year. If it does not
apply the cuts it puts the figure at 3.56 percent.         
    Trailing the conservative opposition in polls, Tsipras is
counting on a less austere budget to gain voters next year, when
his term expires.
    The draft budget projects economic growth will pick up to 
2.5 percent from an expected 2.1 percent this year.  
    ""The tax burden relief and the lowering of social security
contributions would not be possible without the fiscal
performance of the last three years, the fruit of the sacrifices
of Greek citizens,"" the draft said.  
    Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters
earlier on Monday that talks with the EU Commission on freezing
pension cuts were progressing ""on good terms"". 
    Solving this issue amicably is crucial as the country is
closely monitored by markets and any sign of fiscal slippage may
plunge it back into crisis.   
    ""Some common ground will be found with the Commission, since
it is self-evident that the 3.5 percent primary surplus can be
achieved without implementing the fiscal measure of pension
cuts,"" the spokesman said.
    The budget plan projects public debt will fall to 170.2
percent of GDP next year from 183 percent in 2018.
    Tsipras has promised to hand out a social dividend to those
hit hardest during the debt crisis which broke out in 2010. The
exact amount to be spent will be decided after deliberations
with the EU Commission.
    Last month, Tsipras used a keynote policy speech to announce
measures that would help fix the ills of years of
belt-tightening. According to the draft budget these measures
total 1.1 billion euros.[L5N1VU0ON]
    Greece will submit its final 2019 budget in mid-November.

 (Adds Juncker comment)
    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Britain cannot be
bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening
the government's criticism of the European Union for taunting
Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks.
    May's ministers have come out one by one at their party's
annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that
they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to
show ""respect"" in the talks to end Britain's membership.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the
country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than
40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not
only in her governing party but also in Brussels.
    Party unity is on British ministers' minds, and they are
encouraging the faithful to direct their anger at the EU rather
than at their prime minister, who some eurosceptic Conservatives
accuse of leading Britain towards a ""Brexit in name only"".
    But the new strident tone has annoyed many in Brussels,
especially when foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the bloc
to the Soviet Union, the master of several states in eastern
Europe which saw membership of the EU as a measure of their
freedom. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond,
have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a
deal could hurt Britain's economy, the world's fifth largest.
    But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the ""ambition
and pragmatism"" Britain had put forward with May's Chequers
proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement
with her ministers was hashed out in July.
    ""Unfortunately, that wasn't on display in Salzburg,"" he
said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where
EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan.
    ""Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In
return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly
one-sided approach to negotiation.""
    ""What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British
government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of
economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our
country's interests,"" Raab said, later calling again on the EU
to move their position and meet Britain half way.
    Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg
summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the
atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt
May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit.
    
    ""NO CHERRIES""
    A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing
him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: ""A piece
of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries"" ""certainly had an impact"",
one official said.
    With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any
future relationship, the possibility of a ""no deal Brexit"" has
increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a
worst case scenario.
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the
discussion in Britain over Brexit was still far removed from
reality. [nS8N1TF01J]   
    ""The world is watching,"" said Matthew Fell, chief UK policy
director at the Confederation of British Industry. 
    ""Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the
tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of
agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills
would be hugely helpful,"" he told Reuters.
    But one source close to the government said there was now a
sense that the EU had realised that the tone set in Salzburg was
""perhaps a bit off"" and, behind the scenes, conversations
between the two sides were more constructive.
    Raab later said the government was open to looking at
regulatory checks to try to ease talks on a so-called backstop
to prevent a return to a hard border between the British
province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - one of the
outstanding issues yet to be agreed. [nS8N1JB023]
    Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance.
    After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still ""be neighbours
and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,"" he
told the conference, again backing May's Chequers plan.
    ""Mr Tusk says it won't work. But that's what people said
about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.""
    But Hunt's popular line at conference, that the EU was
acting like the Soviet Union, did little to soothe relations,
provoking those eastern members of the bloc which only regained
full independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. They joined the EU more than a decade later.
    Lithuania's EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt
he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed
by the Soviet KGB state security agency.
    ""Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and
Soviet Union,"" he said. ""Anytime. Whatever helps.""
    But back in Birmingham, it was Raab, winning a standing
ovation for his story about his father's journey from then
Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion, who summed up Britain's
new combative stance.
    ""The EU's theological approach allows no room for serious
compromise,"" he said. ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get
serious.""

    * Government has been split on how to tackle issue

 (Recasts with outcome of talks)
    By Holger Hansen and Markus Wacket
    BERLIN/HAMBURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Bleary-eyed leaders of
Germany's coalition parties emerged in the small hours of
Tuesday morning to say they had agreed on a way of cutting
pollution in cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans.
    But they were tight-lipped on the details of their plan,
saying only that ministers would outline the details of a
""highly complex"" agreement later in the day.
    Earlier, conservative Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer
said German carmakers were willing to bear most of the cost of
upgrading old diesel cars to reduce air pollution in German
cities, but it was not yet clear how drivers would be spared the
bill.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Germany's largest carmaker, has
agreed to cover 2,400 euros ($2,780) of the estimated 3,000-euro
cost of hardware retrofits on its diesel cars, Scheuer said on a
live video chat on Instagram.
    ""Now we have to discuss in the coalition how we handle the
gap of 600 euros,"" he added. Scheuer has sided with carmakers in
calling for incentives for owners of older vehicles to trade
them in for newer models. Svenja Schulze, a Social Democrat
(SPD), favours hardware retrofits that are unpopular with auto
makers. [nL8N1WE2TH]
    A statement after the talks tersely promised a ""concept for
clean air in our cities,"" while an unexpected pledge to build
more wind and solar energy plants hinted at the horse-trading
that took place as the three awkward partners struggled to unite
around a common position.
    The past few weeks have seen support slide to all-time lows
for both Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party and its
Social Democrat (SPD) partners, as her government rowed over
everything from diesel to immigration and the threat of
far-right violence.
    The marathon talks, which they promised would become a
regular fixture, also yielded agreement on a new law promoting
skilled immigration, they said.
    The diesel compromise is likely to feature both trade-in
incentives and retrofits. Scheuer said Volkswagen was willing to
offer trade-in deals worth up to 8,000 euros, BMW <BMWG.DE>
6,000 euros and Daimler up to 5,000 euros, as well as leasing
options.
    One complaint of German carmakers is that foreign rivals
would not be covered by any requirement for retrofits. Volvo of
Sweden said it was not working on any such upgrades, but is
looking at incentives to encourage customers to trade in diesels
for newer, cleaner cars. [nS8N1VX02G]
    That option is also being considered by several other
foreign carmakers, said Reinhard Zirpel, head of the VDIK car
importers' association. ""We have legal, technical and business
reservations about hardware upgrades,"" he told the Tagesspiegel
daily.
    
    NO COST TO DRIVERS
    Scheuer also said his Christian Social Union, the Bavarian
sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats - did not want
diesel drivers to face any additional expense.
    The SPD's Schulze said a deal must include hardware upgrades
and that the entire cost should be borne by the industry: ""The
car industry caused the problem, and now they have to fix it,""
she told SWR Radio in an interview.
    Volkswagen's admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel
emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from
several manufacturers routinely exceed pollution limits in
normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown.
    At the same time, the German courts have paved the way for
city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed
European safety levels. The first, in Frankfurt, the financial
capital, is due to take effect in February. [nL3N1W54AN]
    Volkswagen doubts that hardware retrofits on older diesels
are technically feasible and is only willing to foot the bill if
it does not have to bear liability for any engine damage that
may result, a company source said.
    That should not be an obstacle to a solution, according to
suppliers of catalytic converters - devices that can be
installed in cars to convert harmful exhaust pollutants into
less harmful gases.

    * CO2 goals push electric-car prices lower
    * VW among brands seen pricing aggressively
    * Concerns mount over profitability

    By Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive
en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car
launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.
  
    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.
    Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this
week, from PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> electric DS3 Crossback to the
Mercedes <DAIGn.DE> EQC, will erode profitability as they
struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.
    But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as
consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing
carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.
    ""What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is
like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares,
chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.
    A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW <BMWG.DE>, blamed in part
on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a
first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.
    ""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put
the European auto industry in jeopardy.""
    Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime
Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding
a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as
the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to
cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by
2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal
many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of
fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    
    PRICED TO PUSH
    After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions
are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from
diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides
and particulates, but less CO2. [nL8N1QK23C]
    Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and
faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled
emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises
more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has said the ID hatchback, due to
open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced
close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.
    ""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the
same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent
Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.
    ""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been
factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay
penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the
market going.""
    Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want
our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably
equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.
    Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them
have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification
investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.
    They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more
electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by
California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches
are already scheduled globally over the next three years.
        
    COST GAP
    Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on
average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in
hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a
combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.
    When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.
    Mass-market electrics such as the Renault <RENA.PA> Zoe and
Nissan <7201.T> Leaf have been on sale for most of the current
decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla <TSLA.O>
has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric
cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.
    Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already
priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker
acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.
    Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close
to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.
[nL8N1VQ0ZG]
    ""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the
industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley
Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify
investment at all - it's all regulation.""
    Which is why, on this subject more than most, European
carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives
exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their
Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the
region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.
    ""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't
met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA
Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.
    Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.
    ""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich,
chief executive of Valeo <VLOF.PA>, a major manufacturer of
electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot
even though the market doesn't exist.""
        
    SCALE EFFECTS
    Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in
recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.
    Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But
lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric
car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will
pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.
    Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies
are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives
have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. [nL8N1WD2U9]
    Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK
market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition
to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.
    French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to
match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat
told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the
carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.
    ""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,""
Salvat said.
    German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which
includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on
electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their
biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.
    That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and
Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric
cars below cost, in a tougher bind.
    ""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW
research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.
    ""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""

197,460,dc87b4f0ded2ebab4ae9fcefd0fd680c,German parties agree on immigration law to tackle labour shortages,2018-10-02 15:53:47,EUR,0,2018-10-02 15:53:54,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Germany's coalition parties agreed
on a new immigration law on Tuesday to attract more skilled
workers from countries outside the European Union, in a
politically risky push to fill a record number of job vacancies
and stabilise the public pension system.
    Centre-right Chancellor Angela Merkel, hardline Interior
Minister Horst Seehofer and Social Democrat Labour Minister
Hubertus Heil reached a compromise deal that removes labour
market hurdles for all non-EU citizens with job qualifications
and German language skills.
    The three coalition parties agreed in the outline of their
law, seen by Reuters, that companies will be allowed to recruit
foreign workers in all professions, regardless of an official
list of sectors suffering labour shortages.
    The paper also proposes that the government will no longer
insist that companies give preference to German citizens in
filling vacancies before looking for non-EU foreigners.
    In addition, foreign graduates and workers with vocational
training will get an opportunity to come to Germany for six
months to look for a position if they meet certain job
qualifications and German language requirements.
    They also have to prove that they have enough financial
resources so they will not depend on welfare benefits during
their stay in Germany, the parties agreed.
    The compromise deal does not include the so-called
'Spurwechsel' (lane change) proposal which would allow refugees
living in Germany to shed their asylum seeker status if they
find a job and learn German.
    Seehofer, whose CSU party fears losing voters to the
far-right in a regional election later this month, was against
such a provision because he feared it would encourage future
immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills.
    ""We maintain the principle of separation of asylum and
labour migration,"" the outline of the immigration law reads.
    But the parties said they would define a residence status
for well-integrated refugees who cannot be deported and are able
to earn their living on their own in order to give employers and
migrants more security when planning.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Boris Johnson,
Britain's former foreign minister, has told senior members of
the governing Conservative Party he would delay Brexit by at
least six months if he became prime minister, the Sun newspaper
said on Monday.
    The Sun reported that Johnson had been privately setting out
his leadership platform to some ministers in Prime Minister
Theresa May's government and said he wanted to use a pause to
reset the stalled Brexit negotiations.
    Reuters could not confirm the report, which Guy Verhofstad,
a leading EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit, referred to on
Tuesday, saying: ""A prolongation of Art. 50, as Boris Johnson
suggested, is a bad idea as it will prolong the uncertainty for
citizens & businesses.""
    The European Parliament, as well as the British one, must
sign off on any Brexit deal agreed between May and the other 27
EU national leaders. 
    Article 50 is the EU's mechanism for leaving the bloc and it
has a two-year limit. Britain formally triggered it in March
2017 and is due to leave the bloc next March. Any extension
would require unanimity of the remaining EU states.

    * Comes as some German cities ban older diesel models
    * Industry could face big bill as part of clean-up plans 

 (Adds details)
    By Holger Hansen
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Owners of older diesel cars in
German cities where the air is particularly polluted should be
able to choose between trade-in incentives and a hardware
upgrade, coalition parties have agreed according to a paper seen
by Reuters on Tuesday.
    After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders
of her coalition partners announced in the early hours they had
agreed on a way to cut pollution in cities while avoiding
unpopular driving bans. 
    The document, seen ahead of an official announcement of the
deal, said German carmakers had agreed to offer an exchange
programme with attractive trade-in incentives or discounts for
owners of diesel vehicles meeting the older Euro 4 and Euro 5
emissions standards. The current standard is Euro 6.
    The coalition parties said in the document that the
immediate introduction of such trade-in incentives for diesel
vehicles could ensure that all affected drivers of the Euro 4
and 5 standard could get another vehicle before possible driving
bans are introduced.
    Germany's big carmakers -- Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Daimler
<DAIGn.DE> and BMW <BMWG.DE> --  had no immediate comment on the
deal.
    The coalition parties said they expected foreign carmakers
to make similar offers to their customers.
    France's Renault <RENA.PA> said earlier on Tuesday it was
offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives
of up to 10,000 euros to trade in their cars for newer ones.
[nS8N1VX02H]
    Sweden's Volvo had said on Monday it could also consider
offering incentives, but that it was not considering any
hardware retrofits for diesel vehicles in Germany. [nS8N1VX02G]
    
    COSTLY FIX
    The coalition document said that if owners of a Euro 5 model
wanted a hardware retrofit with a so-called selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) system and if this was available and
appropriate, the German government expects the carmakers to
shoulder the costs.
    On delivery vehicles and trade vans, the government would
subsidise hardware retrofits with SCR systems by up to 80
percent, the document said.
    There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4
standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5
million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from
the German KBA transport authority.
    Using a benchmark of 2,400 euros ($2,760) per car that
Volkswagen has agreed to cover for diesel car retrofits, this
could cost the industry up to 13.7 billion euros, excluding the
1.29 million commercial Euro 5 vehicles that are on German
streets.      
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it cheated
U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel
vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution
limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory
crackdown.
    At the same time, the German courts have paved the way for
city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed
European safety levels.
    The city of Hamburg banned older diesels from two of its
roads in May, and a ban in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is
due to take effect next February. [nL3N1W54AN]

European Central Bank said on Tuesday that the European Union
needed clearer rules to combat money laundering and that they
should apply equally in all EU states.
    ""A higher level of harmonisation of the applicable rules in
the form of a regulation should be considered"", Luis De Guindos
told EU finance ministers during a public debate in a meeting in
Luxembourg, which follows a string of high-profile cases of
money laundering at banks in the EU.
    An EU regulation is directly applicable in the 28 member
states, but EU rules against money laundering are currently
defined in directives which give governments broad leeway in
their application, which has resulted in different levels of
enforcement and gaps in the EU framework.

more-than-expected in August, driven higher by more costly
energy, according to data released on Tuesday.
    EU statistics agency Eurostat said prices at factory gates
in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent
month-on-month in August against market expectations of a 0.2
percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
    Year-on-year, producer prices rose by 4.2 percent in August,
against market expectations of a 3.9 percent gain.
    Figures for July were also revised up to 0.7 percent
month-on-month and to and an 18-month high of 4.3 percent
year-on-year.
    Energy prices rose 0.9 percent during August and were 12.0
percent higher than a year earlier.
    Without volatile energy, producer prices were unchanged 
month-on-month and up 1.5 percent year-on-year, confirming the
view of European Central Bank that spiking energy prices are the
main reason for higher inflation.
    Prices at factory gates herald trends in consumer inflation
because unless absorbed by intermediaries or retailers, higher
producer costs translate directly into higher consumer prices.
    The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation
below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term. An early
Eurostat estimate showed last week that in September, consumer
inflation was 2.1 percent year-on-year.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Royal Mail on Oct. 1 forecast a 20 to 28 percent drop in
full-year adjusted operating profit in the face of worse than
expected pressures on letter volumes and productivity.
    - Royal Mail forecast a drop in adjusted operating profit
before transformation costs to between 500 million pounds and
550 million pounds, compared with last year’s 694 million
pounds.
    - The company said it expects to cut costs by only 100
million pounds, well below the 230 million pounds forecast
previously. A range of short-term cost actions will be
implemented, it said without elaborating.
    - The former British postal monopoly has been struggling to
stem falling letter volumes in the era of e-communication and
more recently warned that the new European data and privacy law
could reduce traditional marketing mail.  
    - The company now expects a 7 percent decline in addressed
letter volume compared with its previous forecast of a 4 to 6
percent decline for the medium term.
    - Royal Mail said it expects productivity for 2018-19 to be
significantly below its previous target, which was at the upper
end of the 2 to 3 percent range.
    - It also said that labour market and other cost pressures
would have a higher than expected impact on margins at the
company’s fast-growing European parcel business, GLS.
    - Shares in Royal Mail have fallen 19 percent since the
announcement and were at 366.6 pence by 0742 GMT on Oct. 2.

    * 12 EU countries have such review mechanisms in place
    * Survey sees growing tide of inbound investment into EU

    BUDAPEST, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament approved
new regulations on Tuesday requiring investors from outside the
European Economic Area to get government clearance before buying
assets seen as sensitive to national security.
    The bill - which still needs to be approved by the president
- follows an EU-wide call for greater scrutiny of foreign
investments, part of a bid to respond to a flurry of Chinese
acquisitions in the bloc. [nL5N1SZ3MO]
    Hungarian government officials said it would not focus on
particular countries, but was meant to keep key sectors - such
as the production of arms and ammunition, financial services and
public utilities - under national control.
    Since sweeping to power in 2010, Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orban's government has reclaimed state control of large
swathes of the economy, buying back stakes in major energy
firms, public utilities and banks from mostly western European
owners.
    The regulations, expected to come into force next year, ""may
impact how many Hungarian merger and acquisition transactions
are structured,"" multinational law firm CMS said in a note.    
    Under the terms of the law, investors from outside the
European Economic Area would have to get government clearance to
buy more than 25 percent of private companies in Hungary, and 10
percent of public companies.
    The bill gives the government the power to decide which
sectors are classed as critical. The clearance process can take
60 days, or longer, if an appeal is lodged, according to the
text of the bill.    
    The bill would allow the state to take action ""against
investors from third countries into certain critical
industries,"" the Interior Ministry said.
    A market survey by CMS said an overwhelming majority of
respondents expect an increase in the number of acquisitions of
European companies by non-European investors next year, with
U.S. buyers dominating, followed by Japan and China.
    Twelve EU countries have such review mechanisms in place,
including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Finland and France.

 (Adds Renault CEO comment,)
    By Holger Hansen
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Owners of older diesel cars in
German cities where the air is particularly polluted should be
able to choose between trade-in incentives and a hardware
upgrade, coalition parties have agreed according to a paper seen
by Reuters on Tuesday.
    After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders
of her coalition partners announced in the early hours they had
agreed on a way to cut pollution in cities while avoiding
unpopular driving bans. 
    The document, seen ahead of an official announcement of the
deal, said German carmakers had agreed to offer an exchange
programme with attractive trade-in incentives or discounts for
owners of diesel vehicles meeting the older Euro 4 and Euro 5
emissions standards. The current standard is Euro 6.
    The coalition parties said in the document that the
immediate introduction of such trade-in incentives for diesel
vehicles could ensure that all affected drivers of the Euro 4
and 5 standard could get another vehicle before possible driving
bans are introduced.
    Germany's big carmakers -- Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Daimler
<DAIGn.DE> and BMW <BMWG.DE> --  had no immediate comment on the
deal. If the majority of car owners were to opt for retrofits --
hardware upgrades -- it could cost the industry billions of
euros.
    The coalition parties said they expected foreign carmakers
to make similar offers to their customers.
    France's Renault <RENA.PA> said earlier on Tuesday it was
offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives
of up to 10,000 euros to trade in their cars for newer ones.
[nS8N1VX02H]
    ""We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,"" Renault
Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris
auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight. [nL8N1WH5YT]
    ""It’s the end of the game,"" he added.
    Sweden's Volvo had said on Monday it could also consider
offering incentives, but that it was not considering any
hardware retrofits for diesel vehicles in Germany. [nS8N1VX02G]
    
    BILL TO BE PAID
    The coalition document said that if owners of a Euro 5 model
wanted a hardware retrofit with a so-called selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) system and if this was available and
appropriate, the German government expects the carmakers to
shoulder the costs.
    On delivery vehicles and trade vans, the government would
subsidise hardware retrofits with SCR systems by up to 80
percent, the document said.
    There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4
standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5
million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from
the German KBA transport authority.
    Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of
owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather
than a trade-in.
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it cheated
U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel
vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution
limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory
crackdown.
    At the same time, the German courts have paved the way for
city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed
European safety levels.
    The city of Hamburg banned older diesels from two of its
roads in May, and a ban in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is
due to take effect next February. [nL3N1W54AN]

    By Alexander Tanas
    CHISINAU, Oct 2 (Reuters) - A consortium led by the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development on Tuesday bought a 41
percent stake in Moldova's largest bank, aiming to bring more
transparency to a financial system recovering from a $1 billion
fraud. 
    The EBRD and two private equity firms bought shares in
Moldova Agroindbank, which controls 30 percent of the market and
whose shares had been frozen by regulators and put up for
auction to strategic investors. 
    The sale is a further step in meeting the requirements of
Moldova's international backers, including the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to root out corrupt practices
and make the ownership of lenders more transparent.  
    ""For Moldova this deal is a very important event. Three
years ago the banking sector was not transparent, but now it is
a completely different situation,"" Francis Malige, the EBRD's
Managing Director, Financial Institutions, told Reuters. 
    ""And now the MAIB will also have transparent shareholders
ready to apply the right principles for its development.""
    Along with the EBRD, the consortium is made up of
Vilnius-based Invalda and Horizon Capital, which manages funds
which provide financing to businesses in Ukraine and Moldova.
Together they paid the equivalent of 23 million euros. 
    Moldova plunged into economic and political crisis after the
disappearance of $1 billion from three banks with opaque
ownership structures, including Moldova Agroindbank, between
2012-2014.
    Known locally as the ""theft of the century"", the scandal
triggered street protests, the International Monetary Fund and
the European Union froze aid, the leu currency plunged to record
lows and inflation climbed into double digits.
    With the EBRD's support, earlier this year Romanian lender
Banca Transilvania <ROTLV.BX> bought a minority stake - 39.2
percent - in Victoriabank, the second of three banks involved in
the scandal.
    Moldindconbank, the third, has been under the central bank's
control since October 2016 and the authorities also hope to sell
63.89 percent of its shares to a foreign investor. 
    Moldova Agroindbank's assets are worth 22 billion lei ($1.3
billion). Its shares have been sold at 1,059 lei per share
($62.7).  
    ""First of all, we want to see proper management in these
banks,"" Malige said. ""They will have to achieve such an
institutional strength to prevent the repetition of the
situation that has been in the banking system of Moldova in
recent years.""

    By Simon Carraud and Richard Lough
    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - France seized assets belonging to
Iran's intelligence services and two Iranian nationals in
response to a June plot to attack an exiled Iranian opposition
group's rally outside Paris, the government said on Tuesday.
    France had warned Tehran to expect a robust response after
an Iranian diplomat was arrested in Germany suspected of
involvement in a plot to bomb the meeting of the Paris-based
National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).
    U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and
several former European and Arab ministers attended the rally in
Villepinte.
    ""An attempted attack in Villepinte was foiled on June 30. An
incident of such gravity on our national territory could not go
unpunished,"" said a joint statement by the foreign, interior and
economy ministries.
    A spokesman at the Iranian Embassy in Paris did not
immediately respond to a request for comment. There was no
immediate response to the French move from Tehran.
    The asset freezes targeted two individuals identified as
Assadollah Asadi and Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, the French
statement said. A unit within the Iranian intelligence services
was also targetted. 
    The hardening of relations with France could have wider
implications for Iran. France has been one of the strongest
advocates of salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and
world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in
May.
    On Monday, a court in southern Germany said the detained
Iranian diplomat, who is accredited in Austria, could be
extradited to Belgium, where two other individuals suspected of
involvement in the bomb plot were arrested on June 30. 
    They were caught in possession of explosives.    
    Earlier on Tuesday, some 200 police, some of them elite
officers from Paris, swooped at dawn on a Muslim centre in
northeastern France. Two security sources said the raids were
not linked to the asset freezes.

    BRUSSELS/BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) -
"" Unworkable"", ""unacceptable"", ""impasse"" - the words used to
describe Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union do
little to temper concerns that the two are heading for a chaotic
divorce.
    But behind the scenes, both sides are preparing concessions
as part of what one British official called ""a constructive
dialogue"" that could yet lead to a deal.
    Officials and sources on both sides say there is clear will
to try to overcome the obstacles to winning a withdrawal deal
and agreeing a framework for future ties - a Northern Ireland
border and EU-UK trade deal.
    Details are scarce, but the EU is planning to start putting
in writing its offer for future trade ties, a demand Britain has
pressed after officials felt Prime Minister Theresa May was
snubbed at talks in Austria last month.
    Britain has also promised to bring a new proposal to unlock
a standoff over preventing the return to a hard border between
the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland,
possibly by compromising about regulatory controls on goods in
exchange for Brussels embracing the use of technological fixes
for customs checks. 
    With only six months to go before Britain leaves the bloc,
the lack of clarity over the divorce has spooked markets by
increasing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which both sides
say they are working to avoid.
    On Wednesday, May gives a speech to end a fractious annual
conference of her Conservative Party, where Brexit rebels did
much to undermine her stance of maintaining close ties with the
EU.
    On Thursday, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar will be
in Brussels for talks with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel
Barnier. 
    Senior diplomats in Brussels have been summoned to a Brexit
meeting on Friday and Barnier is due to present to them an
initial draft of the bloc's trade proposal soon after, which the
EU hopes would woo Britain into more compromises. 
    While no new dates have been confirmed for the next round of
negotiations between Barnier and British Brexit minister Dominic
Raab, several EU diplomats said they expected them to take place
in Brussels next week. 
    ""It must be next week or it's too late to get anything done
within our six week schedule,"" one person said, referring to a
plan of having a preliminary Brexit deal at the next EU leaders'
summit on Oct.18. 
    The remaining 27 EU states are due to host a summit on Nov.
17-18 to sign off on any agreement with Britain. Otherwise, they
would switch to contingency mode and focus on preparing for a
no-deal Brexit in which Britain leaves next March with no
agreements in place to mitigate the economic shock.
    
    CUSTOMS VS. REGULATORY CHECKS
    British officials have signalled new ideas will come. A
focus will be attempts to come to agreement over customs
arrangements on the island of Ireland to prevent a return to a
hard border that inflamed sectarian differences in the past.
    Raab welcomed Barnier's suggestion that technology could be
used to help resolve the issue after London said it could not
accept the bloc's proposal for Northern Ireland to effectively
stay in the EU's customs union.
    He also said Britain was looking at how regulatory checks on
some goods could be used as part of a solution to move Brexit
talks, notably on a ""backstop deal"" for the Irish border,
forward.
    London has indicated that it may consider options on
regulations on the island of Ireland, noting there are already
some different rules for agriculture and food products between
Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
    But it was not clear whether the government would tolerate
such a difference for manufactured goods. 
    ""We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs backstop
and on the regulatory side of things, we have been clear that we
will, as long as we can carry the communities of Northern
Ireland with us, we will be open to looking at some of the
options on regulatory checks,"" Raab said on the sidelines of
May's Conservative Party annual conference. [nL8N1WH5X3]
    The EU hopes a more developed promise of seeking close ties
with Britain after Brexit could help May build a majority behind
a divorce deal that the bloc insists must include an emergency
fix for the Irish border.
    The bloc has decided to flesh out the declaration on
post-Brexit ties with Britain a bit more to make the case for
Britons more compelling.

    LILLE, France/PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - French police raided
a Muslim faith centre and arrested three of its leaders for
illegal weapons possession in pre-dawn swoops on Tuesday that
government officials said were prompted by suspicion of links to
terrorist organisations. 
    France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community, remains
on maximum alert after attacks in recent years in which Islamist
militants and people inspired by radical groups such as Islamic
State have killed close to 250 people.
    Some 200 police officers including elite troopers from Paris
took part in raids that began under darkness at the Centre Zahra
France and homes of a dozen of its members, in Grande Synthe
near the northern port town of Dunkirk.
    ""This is a counter-terrorism operation,"" the local prefect's
office said a statement.
    ""The activities of Centre Zahra France are under
particularly close watch given its leaders' clear support for
several terrorist organisations and movements espousing ideas
contrary to (French) republican values.""
    Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said three people were put
in custody after the discovery of illegal arms, and that a
prayer room was being shut.
    The raids coincided with an announcement that France had
also seized assets belonging to Iran's intelligence services and
two Iranian nationals over a June plot to attack an exiled
Iranian opposition group's rally outside Paris. [nL8N1WI2L2]
    Two sources said there was no direct link between the raids
and the Iranian intelligence asset freezes. 
    Assets of the Centre Zahra France were frozen too, along
with financial assets held under other names, on orders issued
by France's interior and finance ministry, a notice published in
the official government journal of legal acts said.  
    The centre's website says it has some 8,000  ""followers"" on
social network sites and its goal is to spread the message of
Islam via film, radio, writings and conferences. It also offers
a contact point on social, family and religious matters.
    France, which is historically a predominantly Roman Catholic
country, is officially secular, with separation by law between
matters of state and religion for over a century. It is home to
five million or more Muslims out of a population of 67 million.
    President Emmanuel Macron, under pressure to get tougher on
radical preachers, has promised to produce plans better defining
the place of Islam's representatives in France. A radical imam
was expelled to Algeria last April from a mosque in Marseille.

 (Adds cabinet approval, quotes from ministers, background)
    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Germany's coalition parties agreed
on a new immigration law on Tuesday to attract more skilled
workers from countries outside the European Union, in a
politically risky push to fill a record number of job vacancies
and stabilise the public pension system.
    Record-high employment and falling joblessness have led to a
tightening labour market in Europe's largest economy, with
employers struggling to staff more than a million positions and
work-related bottlenecks limiting overall economic growth.
    As Germany's workforce is expected to shrink over the next
decades due to an ageing population and low birth rates, more
migrants are seen as crucial to help firms find workers whose
pension contributions support the growing number of retirees.
    But the new immigration law, agreed over night by
centre-right Chancellor Angela Merkel, hardline Interior
Minister Horst Seehofer and Social Democrat Labour Minister
Hubertus Heil, risks angering those voters who already feel
neglected following the arrival of more than a million refugees
since 2015.
    The unprecedented influx of asylum seekers, mainly from
Muslim countries in the Middle East, has already caused a
popular backlash and propelled the far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) party into the national parliament. [nL5N1VY57I]
    Seehofer said the compromise deal would remove labour market
hurdles for non-EU citizens with job qualifications and German
language skills while avoiding new incentives for refugees.
    ""We maintain the principle of separation of asylum and
labour migration,"" Seehofer told reporters during a joint new
conference with Heil and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.
    ""With today's agreement, we have made it possible for the
economic upswing to continue without an abrupt end,"" Altmaier
said, adding that it would strengthen Germany's competitiveness
at a time when other countries were espousing stricter
immigration rules.
    
    STIMULATE GROWTH
    ""With this, we can stimulate additional economic growth by
several tenths of a percent. This is quite a lot,"" he added.
    The coalition parties agreed the outline of the law,
approved by cabinet on Tuesday, that companies will be allowed
to recruit foreign workers in all professions, regardless of an
official list of sectors suffering labour shortages.
    The paper also proposes that the government will no longer
insist that companies give preference to German citizens in
filling vacancies before looking for non-EU foreigners.
    In addition, foreign graduates and workers with vocational
training will get an opportunity to come to Germany for six
months to look for a position if they meet certain job
qualifications and German language requirements.
    They also have to prove that they have enough financial
resources so they will not depend on welfare benefits during
their stay in Germany, the parties agreed.
    The parties also found a compromise wording on the disputed
question of how to avoid the deportation of well-integrated
asylum seekers who have found work and learned German.
    Seehofer, whose CSU party fears losing voters to the
far-right in a Bavarian election later this month, was initially
against allowing migrants to switch out of asylum into residency
status. He feared this would encourage future immigration by
asylum seekers without the right skills.
    The parties agreed to define a residence status for rejected
but well-integrated asylum seekers who cannot be deported --
because of security concerns in their home country -- to enable
them to earn a living and to give their employers more security
when planning.
    ""It's a pragmatic solution which ensures that we're not
sending back the right people,"" Heil said.

 (Recasts with comment from ministers, reaction)
    By Holger Hansen
    BERLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Owners of older diesel cars in
polluted German cities should be able to choose between trade-in
incentives and a hardware upgrade for their vehicles, German
coalition parties agreed but the car industry swiftly raised
objections.
    After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders
of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of
Tuesday that they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the
worst affected cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans.
    In their initial responses, manufacturers appeared to favour
encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for
cleaner vehicles rather than carry out costly adjustments known
as retrofits.
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> had agreed to help with hardware
retrofits but some details still need to be discussed while BMW
<BMWG.DE> has refused such retrofits, German Transport Minister
Andreas Scheuer said on Tuesday.
    Daimler <DAIGn.DE>, the maker of Mercedes cars, has said it
could consider hardware retrofits but would concentrate on
trade-in incentives of up to 5,000 euros ($5,755), Scheuer told
a news conference.
    ""We are talking about a significant billion (euro)
contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,""
said Scheuer. [nS8N1W5028]
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it cheated
U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel
vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution
limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory
crackdown.
    ""We are creating the framework to avoid driving bans but we
expect the car industry to offer possible retrofits and
trade-ins,"" German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said.
    ""My impression is that the car industry has a big interest
in restoring the image of diesel.""
         
    ""END OF ERA""
    Environmental group Greenpeace said the German government
had failed to provide a solution for the diesel crisis and
accused the industry of exploiting the situation.
    ""The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on
emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that
will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,"" it
said.
    The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older
Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is
Euro 6.
    France's Renault <RENA.PA> said earlier on Tuesday it was
offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives
of up to 10,000 euros to trade in their cars for newer ones.
[nS8N1VX02H]
    ""We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,"" Renault
Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris
auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight. [nL8N1WH5YT]
    ""It’s the end of the game,"" he added.
    There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4
standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5
million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from
the German KBA transport authority.
    Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of
owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather
than a trade-in.
    PSA Group's <PEUP.PA> Opel unit rejected hardware retrofits,
arguing they were economically not sensible and the technology
not fully developed. [nS8N1W402K]
    The German courts have paved the way for city driving bans
to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed European safety
levels.
    The city of Hamburg banned older diesels from two of its
roads in May, and a ban in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is
due to take effect next February. [nL3N1W54AN]

    By Francesco Guarascio
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Union needs
clearer rules to combat money laundering that would apply
equally to all EU countries, European Central Bank Vice
President Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday.
    The 28-nation bloc is grappling with high-profile cases of
money laundering at banks in member states, including Estonia,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and Latvia, which
have exposed serious gaps in the EU's framework to fight the
issue.
    ""A higher level of harmonisation of the applicable rules in
the form of a regulation should be considered,"" de Guindos told
EU finance ministers during a public debate in Luxembourg.  
    An EU regulation is directly applicable in all member
countries, but rules against money laundering are currently
defined in directives which give governments broad leeway in
their application. 
    This has resulted in different levels of enforcement and
gaps in the EU framework. Governments have long been reluctant
to give away national powers to monitor banks and fight crime.
    Many confirmed their scepticism to de Guindos's appeal and
to a European Commission plan to strengthen common supervision
against money laundering.
    Germany, the largest country in the bloc, asked for more
time to change the system. 
    Replying to de Guindos's proposal on transforming directives
into a regulation, Joerg Kukies, Germany's state secretary at
the finance ministry, said: ""We think this is not an easy thing
to do in the short term but something we would be very open to
discuss.""
    The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Estonia and Finland said more
time was required to decide which changes were needed,
confirming the sceptical line they held in a closed-door meeting
last week, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters.
    The flexibility given to states in applying money laundering
rules allows them to decide whether to expose banks that are
fined for breaches of the rules. 
    Germany and Luxembourg are among countries that refuse to
reveal all sanctioned banks, despite international guidelines
saying publicity is one of the most efficient tools to combat
money laundering.
    ""All sanction decisions should be published. The current
situation is massively unsatisfactory,"" Nicolas Veron, an
economist at Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel, said.
    
    SINGLE AGENCY
    Many states were even less supportive of the idea of setting
up a common agency to supervise financial crime at banks. 
    The ECB has openly called for such an organisation which
would mirror the monitoring it does on banks' financial
stability.
    France backed the initiative, but many states urged further
talks and Hungary opposed any proposal that would reduce
national powers. 
    The European Commission, which has proposed giving more
powers to the European Banking Authority to close the most
urgent gaps, said the meeting was positive despite the
divisions.
    ""Everybody agrees something needs to be done to strengthen
enforcement,"" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona/London-October 02: The EU's new Worldwide Harmonised 
Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has contributed to several car manufacturers 
issuing profit warnings, Fitch Ratings says. This is due to significant one-off 
costs to certify vehicles under the new procedure, heavy discounting to 
liquidate stocks of vehicles that would not be certified on time and 
manufacturing stoppages ahead of the deadline to avoid assembling uncertified 
vehicles. This in turn led to under-absorption of fixed costs in 1H18. 

However, the impact on sales and profits is likely to be temporary as car 
manufacturers have been adjusting to the new procedure and companies may 
partially recoup in 3Q18 and 4Q18 some of the lost production and sales. The 
ratings of car manufacturers are unlikely to be affected by these distortions 
alone due to their short-lived nature. Some remaining issues from WLTP will be 
compounded by the more stringent set of emission targets for 2030, to be decided 
in the coming days.

Manufacturers struggled this summer with certification of their vehicles to meet 
the WLTP - a laboratory test to measure passenger car fuel consumption and 
emissions in the EU - which came into effect on 1 September 2018 and replaced 
the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) procedure. Some manufacturers have 
commented about bottlenecks in the certification process (notably Volkswagen 
(VW), because of the complexity and size of its product portfolio) leading to 
extra costs and missed sales. 

Furthermore, carmakers used heavy price discounting and increased sales in 
unprofitable channels, such as dealer registrations, to liquidate the stocks of 
vehicles that they would not be able to certify to the new requirements. This 
led to unusually high new registrations numbers in the EU during the summer, 
particularly in August, when registrations increased 31% y-o-y, pushing 
year-to-date growth to more than 6%. However, these discounts contributed to 
lower profits for several manufacturers, including VW, BMW and Daimler, 
resulting in profit warnings. We expect lower sales in September and distortions 
affecting sales and earnings for the rest of the year, with sluggish sales 
growth in the coming months.

title=""EU Cars Registrations"" width=""550"" height=""607"" scrolling=""no"" 
frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe> 


WLTP comes in addition to the switch to real driving emissions (RDE) testing, 
which measures emissions in real-world conditions, not in a laboratory 
environment optimised by manufacturers, and will be gradually implemented 
through to 2021.

The switch to WLTP has caused significant bottlenecks in manufacturers' 
production schedules as each model, body type, engine variant and option package 
need to be approved separately under the new procedure. One or various options 
added to a car may have an impact on its fuel efficiency and hence must be 
tested and certified separately, leading to hundreds of individual 
configurations per manufacturer. Testing facilities worked around the clock for 
months but this was insufficient to certify all models on time. 

Longer-term, the WLTP may support a simplification of some manufacturers' 
product portfolio, notably VW, as they streamline their product ranges to save 
costs and avoid the product complexity highlighted by the new testing procedure. 
Some manufacturers have also said that some powertrains may be at risk, 
including plug-in hybrids whose benefit in terms of CO2 emissions, and hence in 
tax benefits offered in some countries, will be reduced.

WLTP also brings significant uncertainty about the upcoming emission-based tax 
regime in the EU as the calculation of CO2 emissions will differ substantially 
between the NEDC and WLTP systems. Reported CO2 emissions will be significantly 
boosted when calculated under the new regime and this could lead to some 
countries significantly increasing taxes on vehicle purchase. This may have a 
negative effect on product mix, putting pressure on the sale of larger cars or 
vehicles with bigger engines, which are typically more profitable.

    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Possible successors
to Prime Minister Theresa May are using the Conservative Party's
annual conference this week to set out, with varying degrees of
subtlety, their visions for Britain, turning the event into a
parade of potential future leaders. [nL8N1WH6ZA]
    May has vowed to fight on as leader to the next election in
2022, but with Brexit dividing her party and exit negotiations
in Brussels deadlocked, the conference has been dominated by the
possibility her government may fall or party members oust her.  
    Below is a summary of interventions by key figures who could
be in the frame to replace May:
    
    BORIS JOHNSON, 54
    The former foreign minister is May's most outspoken critic
over Brexit, using an interview on the eve of conference to
label her exit plan ""deranged"" and grab the limelight from the
prime minister. He resigned from May's cabinet in July in
protest at her handling of the exit negotiations.
    Johnson, regarded by many eurosceptics as the face of the
Brexit campaign, set out his pitch to the membership in a
bombastic speech on Tuesday at a fringe event which was heavily
oversubscribed and had members queuing for hours to get a seat.
[nL8N1WH6ZA]
    He called on the party to return to its traditional values
of low tax and strong policing, and not to try and ape the
policies of the left-wing Labour Party, whose surprise
resurgence deprived May of her parliamentary majority in a 2017
election.
     
    JEREMY HUNT, 51
    Hunt, who replaced Johnson as foreign minister in July, used
his speech on the main stage to urge the Conservative membership
to set aside their differences over Brexit and unite against a
common foe: the EU. [nL8N1WG0TU]
    Hunt voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. He
served six years as Britain's health minister - a role which has
made him unpopular with many voters who work in or rely on the
state-run, financially stretched National Health Service.
    Appealing to Conservatives among both the 48 percent of
Britons who voted to remain in the EU and the 52 percent who
voted to leave, Hunt adopted an uncharacteristically strident
tone at the conference, warning Brussels that ""if you put a
country like Britain in a corner, we don't crumble. We fight"". 
    But, while a comparison between the EU and the Soviet Union
went down well with delegates, it attracted anger from some
inside the EU and was disowned by May. [nL8N1WI1J1]
              
    JACOB REES-MOGG, 49
    A flamboyant millionaire who cultivates the image of an
English gentleman from another century, Rees-Mogg has developed
a cult following among those who want a more radical departure
from the EU than May is proposing. [nL8N1WH1OH]
    He used several appearances at fringe events to advocate a
free trade deal based on the one agreed between the EU and
Canada -- something May says would create an unacceptable border
between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. If not Canada,
Rees-Mogg wants to trade with the EU on World Trade Organization
(WTO) terms.      
    But does he want the top job? When one man shouted ""sack the
woman"" at a mention of May, Rees-Mogg quipped ""certainly not"".
Asked if he would run for leader if May were toppled, Rees-Mogg
said the party should back her.
    ""I know, I know,"" he said when they booed his answer.
    
    DOMINIC RAAB, 44
    Britain's Brexit negotiator is a new face at the top table
of government, promoted when David Davis resigned in protest at
May's exit plan in July. He has taken over the exit
negotiations, albeit in a more subordinate role to May than his
predecessor.
    Like Hunt, Raab used his conference speech to criticise the
EU's approach to negotiations, warning Brussels not to bully
Britain. Raab, a lawyer by training, twinned the message with a
well-received story about his Jewish father's escape from 
Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1938. [nL8N1WH3I3]

    The interior minister had to compete with Johnson's speech
for the members' attention on Tuesday, but used appearances at
fringe events to set out a domestic policy agenda he thinks will
help the Conservatives win the next election.
    Housing, he said, is the biggest problem the party has to
solve to appeal to voters under 40 who have been left with 
""faces pressed up against the estate agents' windows"" by soaring
prices and a shortage of new homes.
    Javid, a second-generation immigrant of Pakistani heritage,
has served a number of cabinet roles and scores consistently
well in polls of party members. A champion of free markets, he
has talked about having a portrait of former Conservative prime
minister Margaret Thatcher on his office wall.
    
    MICHAEL GOVE, 51
    Gove, one of the highest-profile Brexit campaigners during
the referendum, has had to rebuild his cabinet career after
falling early in the contest to replace former prime minister
David Cameron. 
    High-energy, and seen as one of the most effective members
of cabinet in bringing forward new policies, Gove used his
appearances at this week's conference to pledge loyalty to May
and back her Brexit plan.
    In doing so he rejected the rival proposals put forward by
Johnson, with whom he teamed up during their Brexit campaign
only to pull his support for Johnson’s 2016 leadership bid at
the last moment and run himself.

127 million euros behind its tax revenue target for 2018 at the
end of September, limiting the government's room for a more
generous budget package next week, unless, as expected, it
raises money elsewhere.
    Ireland has consistently beaten its revenue target in recent
years, even as it gradually unwinds tax increases introduced
during the financial crisis due to a rapid jobs recovery and the
benefits of being a major location for multinational companies.

value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1
percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent
underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company
tax gains.
    The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up
year-on-year, the data from the finance department showed on
Tuesday, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
    Assuming fiscal targets are met, Irish Finance Minister
Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million euros to dish out on
further tax cuts and spending increases next year, having
already committed over 2 billion through previously announced

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/London-October 02: North Rhine-Westphalia's (NRW) 
60-year bond highlights the trend for German states (Laender) to extend debt 
maturities and lock in cheap funding, Fitch Ratings says. However, we think 
other Laender, whose annual funding needs are lower than NRW's, are less likely 
to issue ultra long-dated bonds. 

NRW priced its 60-year 1.95% EUR900 million bond on 19 September. The deal was 
oversubscribed and follows NRW's 50-year issuance in July this year and a 
40-year deal last October. These two bonds totalled EUR2.6 billion and both pay 
1.75%. 

Longer-dated issuance has seen NRW extend the weighted average maturity of its 
debt to 9.7 years at end-September 2018, from 7.1 years in 2016. The coupons on 
its 40, 50, and 60-year bonds are below or close to the average interest rate of 
1.9% that NRW paid on its capital market debt last year. NRW is reducing its 
exposure to rising interest rates as the ECB prepares to end its Quantitative 
Easing programme and potentially to increase policy rates (we forecast one 25bp 
hike in 2019 and two in 2020). 

Laender have extended debt maturities as part of their efforts to keep interest 
rate costs sustainable. Moreover, from 2020, they will have to run balanced 
budgets without taking on new debt. Fiscal consolidation in preparation for this 
'debt brake' has seen debt-service ratios improve. Direct debt fell to 145% of 
current revenue in 1H18 from 173% in 2015, and we forecast it to decline to 134% 
by 2020. The payback ratio fell by nearly 10 years, to 15.5 years. Falling 
interest rates helped interest paid on operating revenue fall by nearly 1pp to 
3.7%. 

Of NRW's total EUR139.2 billion of debt at end-2017, EUR129.4 billion pays a 
fixed interest rate (including hedged floating-rate debt). NRW's debt burden is 
the highest of all the Laender, and large amounts of debt mature annually 
(EUR16.7 billion in 2018). While this means that debt servicing equals  around 
one-third of current revenue (31.3% in 2017), it also means that NRW enjoys 
frequent issuer status among investors, and has been able to issue very long- 
dated debt in benchmark sizes. 

NRW's long track record of capital market borrowing and the absence of maturity 
concentration risk mean we assume refinancing risk is low. We affirmed its 'AAA' 
rating in May along with those of 10 other Laender. The ratings reflect the 
stability of the solidarity system that underpins the creditworthiness of all 
Laender.

 (Recasts on deficit target, upgrade of GDP forecasts)
    By Padraic Halpin
    DUBLIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ireland expects to hit its budget
deficit target of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product this
year after a sharp hike to its economic growth forecast offset
overspending in some areas and a slightly weaker than
anticipated tax take.
    Ireland's finance department increased its forecast for GDP
growth this year to 7.4 percent from a previous estimate of 5.6
percent and nudged up its projection for next year to 4.2
percent from the 4.0 percent forecast six months ago.
    Irish GDP has outperformed everywhere in Europe since 2014
but the relevance of using the conventional measure of growth
has diminished after a series of distortions related to
Ireland's large multinational sector that hit again this year,
leading to first half growth of 9.1 percent. [nS8N1SB01Z]
    ""We expect to come in bang on the nose in and around a
deficit of 0.2 percent this year as projected, with the good
things being counteracted by overruns in other areas,"" Prime
Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament.
    The main overspending at the end of the third quarter was
again in the health department which was running 301 million
euros or 2.7 percent above profile, data from the finance
department showed on Tuesday.
    While total spending was 0.1 percent behind where the
government had estimated, the money set aside for departments
and capital projects is typically spent by the end of the year.
    The exchequer also remained 0.3 percent or 127 million euros
behind its tax revenue target for 2018 at the end of September,
which analysts said did little to change the arithmetic for next
Tuesday's presentation of the budget for 2019.
    While corporate tax receipts were 6.3 percent ahead of
target at the end of the third quarter, income tax and
value-added tax, the two largest tax categories, stood 0.1
percent and 0.3 percent below target. A large 8.0 percent
underperformance in excise duty more than wiped out the company
tax gains.
    The total tax take, however, was still 5.2 percent up
year-on-year, reflecting Ireland's strongly performing economy.
    Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has a modest 800 million
euros to dish out on further tax cuts and spending increases
next year, having already committed over 2 billion through
previously announced increases in current and capital spending. 
    Donohoe is expected to find extra money through measures
under consideration including the scrapping or part-scrapping of
a reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector, although he is also
under pressure from the country's central bank to target a
budget surplus next year instead of the planned minor deficit.
[nL5N1UR5SX] 
    ""With Brexit uncertainties looming, it remains to be seen
whether the minister will aim for a cautious budget, eschewing
large giveaways, in favour of a more ambitious target for a
surplus,"" Davy Stockbrokers chief economist Conall MacCoille
wrote in a note.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

352,758,7719d528a2082f4eed5ac3102d98d238,ECB may need to take bigger role to promote instant payments: Mersch,2018-10-03 14:49:05,EUR,0.66691,2018-10-03 14:49:12,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    RIGA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Europe needs a wide-reaching, cheap
and instant retail payment system to stop overseas competitors
taking this market and the European Central Bank should consider
taking a bigger role in the field, ECB board member Yves Mersch
said on Wednesday.
    Instant payment systems are already in place from mobile
payment services to point-of-sale payments but most are limited
in their geographic reach, leaving PayPal and big American IT
firms dominating the market.
    ""Payment service providers around Europe need to start
offering their customers instant payment services. And they need
to do so quickly,"" Mersch told a conference in Riga.
    ""To promote euro area-wide, smooth and efficient payment
systems in line with our mandate, we might even have to reflect
on whether broader access to central bank accounts for retail
purposes may be needed,"" he added.
    Such a system would only work if it is truly pan-European,
instant, cheap and not restricted to a particular group of
clients, Mersch added.
    PayPal now dominates the European market for online payments
but players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Chinese
giants like Alibaba and Tencent are also taking market share.
    Mersch added that ultimately it will be the responsibility
of each service provider to gain the necessary size but noted
that the November launch of the ECB's instant payment system
between banks, called TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, could
provide a foundation.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN RELIEF HELPS EUROPE BOUNCE BACK (0727 GMT)
    Reports that the Italian government aims to lower its budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 from
the 2.4 percent targeted for next year [nI6N1VP01Z] is spreading some optimism among investors,
helping European and Italian stocks rebound after a turbulent start of the week.
    The STOXX 600 <.STOXX> is rising 0.3 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB is bouncing up more than 1
percent and almost all sectors are trading in the black. Activity was reduced by the closure of
the DAX.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

each, while Mediobanca <MDBI.MI>, UBI Banca <UBI.MI>, and Banco
BPM <BAMI.MI> also rose as much as 5 percent.
    Outside of politics, Oslo-listed aluminium firm Norsk Hydro

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
tumbled on Wednesday on reports that Rome plans to cut the
budget deficit faster than expected, easing fears about the
fiscal policy of the euro zone's third- biggest economy.
    Italy's government foresees the budget deficit falling to
2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent
in 2021 from the 2.4 percent expected next year, a government
source from the right-wing League party said on Wednesday
[nI6N1VP01Z].
    That bought relief to the bond market. It has taken a
beating since the coalition - of which the League is a member -
said last week it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
over the next three years, tripling the previous target.
    Italian bond yields fell six to 19 basis points across the
board, after four days of sharp rises <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>.    
     The 10-year Italian government bond yield fell 10 bps to
3.33 percent <IT10YT=RR>. It pulled back from the 4 1/2-year
high around 3.46 percent it reached on Tuesday, when comments
from a lawmaker about Italy's position in the euro bloc fuelled
a selloff. 
     Wednesday's fall in Italian yields left the gap over
benchmark German bond yields <DE10YT=RR>, a closely followed
indicator of relative country risks, at 290 bps -- down from
around 300 bps late Tuesday.
    ""The deficit forecast news is main reason markets are doing
what they are doing today,"" said KBC rates strategist Mathias
van der Jeugt.
    ""But this is too little to bridge the gap between the EU and
Italy. We might get some more relief, but I think it will be
short-lived unless Italy comes up with a better proposal that is
more aligned with what the EU wants.""
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which only emerged from its third international bailout
in August [nL8N1WI4KW]. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to meet with
ministers to discuss the budget targets for 2019-2021 at around
1100 GMT on Wednesday, a source told Reuters.
    The 2020-2021 deficit numbers were first reported by the
newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, lifting the
euro <EUR=> during Asian trade [nL4N1WJ0I0]. 
    The euro was last up 0.3 percent against the dollar. Italian
shares rose 1.3 percent <.FTMIB>, outperforming European stocks
overall <.STOXX>.
    As Italy's bond market rebounded, yields on higher-rated
euro zone bonds rose. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up three
bps at 0.46 percent.
    ""The (Italian) situation remains fluid and mood can make
sudden U-turns, depending on a rather unpredictable news flow,""
analysts at UniCredit said in a note.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The carmaker may
spin off or sell its Magneti Marelli unit. Handing it to
shareholders would let them keep any upside. But the outlook for
parts makers is mixed, and valuations low. Selling to the likes
of KKR makes more sense, even if CEO Mike Manley has to accept a
price cut.

its investment recommendation on two-year Italian government
bonds to overweight, following a budget related selloff in the
country's debt. 
    Italian two-year government bond yields have risen around 50
basis points in the past week, after the country's government
revealed on Thursday a higher-than-anticipated budget deficit of
2.4 percent for 2019. 
    But short-dated bonds now look attractive versus cash, UBS
Wealth said in a note, adding that two-year yields offered
around 160 basis points over comparably rated euro-denominated
bonds. 
    ""While we believe that Italy's credit rating is likely to be
downgraded by one notch, the country is likely to retain an
investment grade rating for at least the next 12 months, and we
believe there is only a very low probability that Italy will
default within the next two years,"" Mark Haefele, global chief
investment officer at UBS Wealth, said in the note. 
    However, UBS Wealth cautioned against holding long-dated
Italian bonds, and advised against any concentrated exposure to
them. 
    It noted possible risks associated with the position,
including escalating tensions between Italy and the European
Union over the budget, a breakdown of the current coalition
government, or a departure of Finance Minister Giovanni Tria.

    By Rahul Karunakar
    Oct 3 (Reuters) - The expansion in euro zone business activity eased in September to a four-month low, driven by the weakest factory growth in two years that was only partly offset by a pick-up among services providers, a survey showed on Wednesday.
    IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, eased to a four month-low in September of 54.1 from August's 54.5.
    That was below an earlier flash estimate of 54.2, but held well above the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.
    Optimism about the future brightened a bit at the end of the third quarter from a near-two-year low. The composite future output PMI rose to 62.1 from  61.6.
    But manufacturing activity has dwindled across the euro currency bloc this year, in line with evidence of moderation elsewhere around the globe.
    That suggests overall economic growth in the currency bloc is well past its peak and the pace of business activity is likely to ease further in coming months.
    ""Although running close to a two-year low, the disappointing September PMI remains at a relatively elevated level and signals solid growth,"" noted Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
    ""However, the fourth quarter is unlikely to see such robust growth, as recent months have seen a clear loss of momentum in terms of both output and new order gains.""
    The surveys point to quarterly euro zone economic growth of 0.5 percent. That is slightly higher than a 0.4 percent consensus in a recent Reuters poll of economists, who unanimously said that the U.S.-China trade war threatened the already modest outlook. [ECILT/EU]
    Manufacturers are increasingly concerned about barriers to global trade, which was clear from the readings of forward-looking factory PMI survey indicators. Growth in new export orders eased to the lowest in more than five years. [nL9N1S702B]
    The latest surveys show a clear divergence between performance by euro zone services and manufacturing firms.
    Services activity picked up to the highest in three months, as measured by the final services PMI at 54.7, which matched the  flash reading but was higher than 54.4 in August.
    Services firms hired at a slightly faster pace than in August, too. The employment sub-index rose to 55.5, not seen since October 2007, during boom times before the last financial crisis. It was 55.3 in August.
    ""While employment gains remained historically high, a steady erosion in the rate of order book growth so far this year suggest the appetite to hire will soon wane without any notable upturn in new order inflows,"" added Williamson.
    ""With business confidence about the outlook running at one of the lowest seen over the past two years, companies are clearly not expecting any such imminent turn-around in demand.""

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Former Fiat Chrysler
<FCHA.MI> <FCAU.N> boss Sergio Marchionne was a master of
spinoffs. The Ferrari <RACE.MI> and industrial businesses he
handed over to shareholders are now worth 50 percent more than
the carmaker itself. Yet new boss Mike Manley may find a quick
and dirty sale is best for auto supplier Magneti Marelli. 
    Fiat is mulling two options for the maker of headlights,
exhaust systems and electrical gizmos: list it and distribute
shares to Fiat investors, or sell to a third party, most likely
a private equity fund. Manley had lined up Calsonic Kansei, a
parts maker owned by KKR <KKR.N>, as a preferred bidder, but is
now courting others after KKR’s offers fell short of
expectations. Fiat Chairman John Elkann wants an enterprise
value of at least 6 billion euros, according to a person
familiar with the matter.
    A spinoff would probably create value. Including debt,
listed peers Hella <HLE.DE>, Valeo <VLOF.PA> and Faurecia
<EPED.PA> are valued at an average of 7.2 times 2018 operating
profit, according to Eikon. That’s over twice Fiat’s multiple of
3.2. As well as receiving shares in a more highly-rated company,
investors could keep any upside from future growth.
    The snag is that car suppliers are in a funk. Thomson
Reuters’ Auto, Truck and Motorcycle Parts Index has fallen 26
percent this year as investors fretted about trade wars and a
profit warning from industry bellwether Continental.  
    And Magneti Marelli faces longer-term pressures. Its revenue
growth has slowed from 11.7 percent in 2015 to 7.4 percent last
year, according to Evercore analysts, who expect growth to fall
to just 3 percent in 2019. Its “powertrain” or engine-systems
business, which makes up 15 percent of revenue, may shrink as
consumers switch to electric vehicles. Fiat investors risk
getting stuck with discounted shares in a slow-growing business.
    That would make private equity’s bag of cash look
attractive. KKR has lined up Japanese banks to provide 5 billion
euros of funding for its bid, Reuters reported. Even an offer at
that price would still be a 30 percent premium to Marelli’s
value including debt of 3.9 billion euros on listed peer
multiples. And investors would get their hands on the money
right away, rather than having to wait for a takeover or for
supplier valuations to recover. It’s worth breaking with Fiat’s
esteemed tradition of spinoffs.

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): European Car Financing Vulnerable to Residual 
Value Outlook 

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10045729

Fitch Ratings-London-October 03: German auto makers' financing arms would see 
profitability fall sharply if there were a large, sudden decline in second-hand 
car prices, Fitch Ratings says. European lease-focused banks' capital would drop 
significantly, but remain above regulatory minimums. But large, diversified 
banks would see little impact, even if they have large vehicle leasing 
businesses. 

Vehicle financing has supported new vehicle registrations in Europe in recent 
years. Operating leases, where the lessor retains ownership of the vehicle, have 
accounted for an increasing proportion of financing, particularly in Germany and 
the UK, the largest markets for new cars. In the wake of emissions-test cheating 
scandals, and a fear of a glut in second-hand cars, this exposes the lessor to 
residual value (RV) risk - the risk that second-hand car prices will fall below 
the estimate at the inception of the lease. 

To test resilience to RV risk, we used a hypothetical scenario involving a 20% 
fall in second-hand prices and a 100% turn-in rate, translating into a 5% ""shock 
depreciation"" on the entire operational lease portfolio of major captives, banks 
and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) as at end-2017. This scenario, which 
is much harsher than our RV assumptions, results in EUR9.5 billion of extra 
impairments on EUR190 billion of RVs. 

More than half of these impairments (EUR5.4 billion) would be at German 
captives, reducing profitability by over 80%, due to their concentrated 
portfolios. However, assuming impairments were spread out over three years, 
consistent with typical 'straight-line' depreciation policies on operational 
leases, rather than a one-off hit, impairments would typically be around a 
quarter of divisional profits before taxes. 

Depletion of lease banks' CET1 ratios would range between 0.1% and 5.3% in a 
one-off shock, but would remain well above regulatory minimums. Large European 
banks with significant vehicle leasing portfolios have bigger and more 
diversified balance sheets and would largely shrug off the low (10bp-23bp) CET1 
ratio impact. 

Mitigants to an unexpected RV shock include the likelihood that manufacturers 
would provide support to captives, both directly (through financial guarantees) 
and indirectly (for example by adjusting pricing to regulate vehicle 
inventories). Both captives and financing NBFIs may get volume discounts from 
manufacturers when buying new vehicles in bulk, giving them some additional 
headroom for RV declines. 

Leading lessors have sophisticated pricing and risk systems, including 
monitoring and forecasting used car prices. These will be influenced in the long 
term by innovations such as ride-hailing schemes and autonomous vehicles, 
although we believe the impact of electrification on RVs will be visible 
earlier.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italian stocks turned from a drag
into a boost for European markets on Wednesday as signs the
government would target a lower budget deficit quelled
investors' fears of a damaging showdown with the European
Commission.
    Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> jumped as much as 3 percent
after government bond yields fell back and the spread to Bunds
narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting a lower
budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. [nL8N1WJ0NR]
    Still in the thrall of developments on the Italian front,
the leading euro zone stocks index <.STOXX50E> and the
pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> climbed 0.3 percent with bank
stocks <.SX7P> the best-performing, up 0.8 percent.
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> outperformed, up 0.5 percent with
the banks index last trading up 0.7 percent.
    Unicredit <CRDI.MI> and Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> were among
the top gainers, up 2.6 percent each, while Mediobanca
<MDBI.MI>, UBI Banca <UBI.MI>, and Banco BPM <BAMI.MI> also rose
as much as 5 percent.
    Banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, suffer the
most from selloffs in the bond market and the index saw its
fifth consecutive day down on Tuesday before news the government
was aiming for a lower budget deficit.
    ""Any indication from the government that may deny such
indications and lead to a step up in confrontation will
negatively affect BTP spreads,"" said Unicredit analysts.
    ""The situation remains fluid and mood can make sudden
U-turns, depending on a rather unpredictable news flow.""
    Outside politics, Oslo-listed aluminium firm Norsk Hydro
<NHY.OL> was the biggest faller, tumbling 13.6 percent after
announcing it would shut all output from its Alunorte alumina
refinery in Brazil. [nFWN1WJ031]
    ""This is a very serious event for Norsk Hydro, potentially
leading to severe losses,"" said a trader.
    Grifols <GRLS.MC> shares fell 6 percent after UBS analysts
cut the stock to sell from neutral, saying competitive risks are
rising.
    ""Fc Rn inhibitors, a new class of drug we expect to launch
in 2021, threaten to replace up to 20 percent of Grifols sales,""
said analysts at the Swiss bank. 
    Tesco <TSCO.L> shares fell 8.5 percent after Britain's
biggest retailer reported first-half profits which missed
analysts' forecasts. [nL8N1WJ0T9]
    ""Good like-for-like (sales), but weak bottom line points to
margin destruction,"" said a trader. 
    Shares in French tech consultancy Altran <ALTT.PA> jumped 9
percent to 8.12 euros, at the top of the STOXX after Kepler
Cheuvreux analysts upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"" with
a price target of 10 euros.
    Kepler analysts said they see no risk for liquidity, and
that Altran's current share price values its global design and
engineering company Aricent at roughly 0. 
    The stock, down 40 percent in the third quarter alone, is a
popular short, amplifying any positive moves as short-sellers
unwind their positions.

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The cash-strapped
country raised more money than expected thanks to the canny way
it sold mobile spectrum. The consequences are for others. If
operators raise prices, it’s effectively a stealth tax. If they
can’t, there will be less cash to build new networks in Europe.
        
    Full view will be published shortly.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italy said on Oct. 2 that its auction of fifth-generation
(5G) mobile spectrum raised 6.55 billion euros, or 164 percent
more than the value of initial offers.
    - Debt-heavy Telecom Italia spent 2.41 billion euros, and
said it expected to pay out around 480 million euros of the
overall amount in 2018. 
    - Vodafone Italy bought airwaves in three frequency ranges
for a total of 2.4 billion euros. It said some of the spectrum
could be immediately used to enhance coverage and improve
capacity.
    - France’s Iliad paid about 1.2 billion euros, while Wind
Tre paid just over 500 million euros. Fastweb, a broadband and
landline company, bought a small block of spectrum for roughly
33 million euros. 
    - Telecom Italia and Vodafone shares were up 0.6 percent and
1.3 percent respectively at 0810 GMT on Oct. 3. Iliad rose 0.7
percent and CK Hutchison – the holding company of Wind Tre’s
Hong Kong-based parent – was down almost 1 percent.

    Web Summit moved to Lisbon from Dublin in 2016 and the event

must focus on getting a divorce deal with an emergency Irish
border fix before they embark on discussions on their
post-Brexit trade ties, the Czech Republic's pointman on Europe
said. 
    Britain is due to leave the EU in 177 days but talks on
managing the unprecedented split have stalled over differences
on how to avoid border checks between EU member Ireland and
Britain's province of Northern Ireland afterwards.
    Eyes are on British Prime Minister Theresa May's final
speech at her Tory Party conference on Wednesday. [nL8N1WI5PB] A
flurry of activity will follow as both sides seek to try to
break the deadlock in time for EU summits on Oct.18 and
Nov.17-18 at the latest. [nL8N1WI4Y0]
    ""The chief concern for the EU right now is reaching a deal
on the Withdrawal Agreement that would provide us with a two
year transition period in which to set out the future
relationship between the EU and the UK,"" State Secretary for
European Affairs Ales Chmelar said in a comment to Reuters,
adding that divorce must cover an Irish fix. 
    That differs from Britain's preferred option of focusing on
agreeing close future ties in trade. London wants this
post-Brexit arrangement to regulate the Irish border but the
bloc wants an emergency solution if trade talks fail or take
longer.
    ""The future relationship ... is a matter for future
discussions. Without the Withdrawal Agreement we are, very soon,
heading towards a no deal scenario in which a hard border would
inevitably be drawn up,"" Chmelar said. 
    As both sides ready concessions in the coming days, Britain
is expected to present a new proposal for the Irish border soon.
    From the EU side, the other 27 member states will put in
writing for the first time next week their free trade proposal
for Britain for after Brexit, hoping a more fleshed-out promise
would woo London into compromises on Ireland and help May get
enough support behind any divorce deal.

deficit and maintain labour market reforms to resist future
shocks as downside risks to the economy build, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday.
    The IMF trimmed its forecast for 2018 growth in the euro
zone's fourth-largest economy to 2.7 percent, in line with the
Socialist government's expectations, from the 2.8 percent
forecast it made in April.
    The Spanish economy is showing signs of flagging after 19
consecutive quarters of growth, but is still on track to remain
among the fastest growing in Europe. [nL5N1VR5MP]

    REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT EUROPEAN STOCKS (1002 GMT)
    There's growing evidence the trade war is hurting global economic activity, and European
stocks remain in thrall of politics, but Barclays analysts still find reasons to be cheerful. 
    ""Positioning on Europe appears to be particularly bearish and it is the only region to have
seen net outflows year-to-date,"" they note, but they see positives outweighing the negatives and
expect ""modest upside"" into the end of the year. 
    Fundamentals are supportive overall, they maintain. Here are their reasons to be cheerful: 
    * Global growth should be resilient in 2018 at around 4%
    * Earnings revisions are on the right track
    * P/E multiples have fallen 
    * Investors have derisked and sentiment is cautious, but Q4 is typically more positive
    * FX is turning into a support again for the euro zone and UK

    As you can see below, after cyclicals underperformed over Q3, they've started coming back
again as the Citi economic surprise indicator for the euro zone bottomed out. 
    Barclays back cyclical stocks and have a couple of pretty contrarian calls including
overweight financials and autos - but on the big issue of the day, Italy, they remain negative:
""We expect Italy to enter a prolonged period of volatility, which is unlikely to help  European
markets"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN RELIEF HELPS EUROPE BOUNCE BACK (0727 GMT)
    Reports that the Italian government aims to lower its budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 from
the 2.4 percent targeted for next year [nI6N1VP01Z] is spreading some optimism among investors,
helping European and Italian stocks rebound after a turbulent start of the week.
    The STOXX 600 <.STOXX> is rising 0.3 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB is bouncing up more than 1
percent and almost all sectors are trading in the black. Activity was reduced by the closure of
the DAX.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

    LISBON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Europe's largest tech event, the
Web Summit, will remain in Lisbon for another 10 years, its
founder Paddy Cosgrave said on Wednesday in a boost to
Portugal's aspirations of becoming a technology hub.
    ""Staying here for another 10 years brings us so much
certainty,"" Cosgrave told journalists at a press conference
where he was joined by Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.
""My heart and the team's heart is in Lisbon.""
    Lisbon scored a big coup when Web Summit moved from Dublin
to Portugal in 2016, helping a recovery in the country's capital
after the 2011-2014 debt crisis. 
    Web Summit has helped put Lisbon on the map and drive a
tourist boom, as well as attract technology firms to the city.
    ""It's a pleasure to host Web Summit in Portugal for the next
10 years,"" Costa said. ""It puts Portugal at the heart of the
global conversation about tech and innovation.""
    The government estimates that the event itself generates 300
million euros ($347 million) for Lisbon in hotel and other
revenue during the week it takes place in November.
    Around 70,000 people attended the Web Summit last year and
the organisers hope to boost that to 100,000. 
    The original Web Summit contract envisioned three years in
Lisbon and the Web Summit organizers had considered moving to
other venues in Europe before deciding to stay. 
    The event is held in the pavilions built for Lisbon's 1998
World Fair and one of the reasons the organizers decided to stay
is because it can expand further in that area.

    MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Spain should rein in its debt and
deficit and maintain labour market reforms to resist future
shocks as downside risks to the economy build, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday.
    The IMF trimmed its forecast for 2018 growth in the euro
zone's fourth-largest economy to 2.7 percent, in line with the
Socialist government's expectations, from the 2.8 percent
forecast it made in April.
    The Spanish economy is showing signs of flagging after 19
consecutive quarters of growth, but is still on track to remain
among the fastest growing in Europe. [nL5N1VR5MP]    
    ""At this juncture, it is critical to strengthen the
economy's resilience to withstand shocks,"" the IMF said in the
concluding statement of its 2018 report on Spain. 
    ""Two policy areas are key for this goal: restarting
structural fiscal adjustment and preserving the thrust of the
labour market reforms"" introduced by the previous conservative
government, it added.
    Debt levels have only come down marginally while the economy
has grown strongly, making the government's aim to cut the
deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP for 2019 ""critical and
appropriate"", the IMF said. 
    It urged the government to preserve the thrust of the 2012
labour market reform, which included wage flexibility that ""has
underpinned Spain's job-rich economic recovery and regained
competitiveness"".   
    A sustainable and comprehensive pension package is also
needed to address current tensions in the system, the IMF said.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy's government bond yields
fell on Wednesday on reports that Rome plans to cut the budget
deficit faster than it had previously indicated, easing fears
about the fiscal policy of the euro zone's third- biggest
economy.
    Rome foresees the budget deficit falling to 2.2 percent of
gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the
2.4 percent expected next year, a government source from the
right-wing League said on Wednesday [nI6N1VP01Z].    
    That bought relief to the bond market, the euro and stocks. 
    Later in the session, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
appeared to confirm the source-based report, saying Italy's
budget deficit will fall gradually from 2020 [nR1N1VZ00T].
    Debt markets, in particular, have taken a beating since the
coalition government - of which the League is a member - said
last week it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP over
the next three years, tripling the previous target.
    Italian borrowing costs were broadly lower on Wednesday
after four days of sharp rises <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>, but off
lows hit in early trade, as a note of caution crept back in. 
     The 10-year Italian government bond yield was down 4 bps at
3.39 percent <IT10YT=RR>, below Tuesday's 4 1/2-year high around
3.46 percent. 
    That left the gap over benchmark German bond yields
<DE10YT=RR>, a closely followed indicator of relative country
risks, at 295 bps versus 300 bps late Tuesday.
    ""The deficit forecast news is main reason markets are doing
what they are doing today,"" said KBC rates strategist Mathias
van der Jeugt.
    ""But this is too little to bridge the gap between the EU and
Italy. We might get some more relief, but I think it will be
short-lived unless Italy comes up with a better proposal that is
more aligned with what the EU wants.""
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which only emerged from its third international bailout
in August [nL8N1WI4KW]. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to meet with
ministers to discuss the budget targets for 2019-2021 at around
1100 GMT on Wednesday, a source told Reuters.
    ""Let's not forget the yield is pretty high, so there is a
carry element as well, so people latch on to any newsflow that
may be coming through,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment
strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, referring to
the recovery in Italian bonds. 
    UBS Wealth said that it now saw two-year Italian bonds as
attractive after the heavy selloff [nL8N1WJ1CP].
    The euro <EUR=> and stocks also benefited from the more
positive noises coming from Rome. Italian shares rose 0.85
percent <.FTMIB>, outperforming European stocks overall
<.STOXX>.    
    As Italy's bond market rebounded, yields on higher-rated
euro zone bonds rose. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up 1.5
bps at 0.44 percent.

    EUROPEAN EQUITIES: CHEAP ISN'T BEAUTIFUL (1050 GMT)
    How cheap until European shares become irresistible?
    A lot has been said about the divergence between Wall Street's buoyant indexes and Europe's
red-tainted bourses and whether that gap can be filled.
    Noting a ""sharp de-rating"" of European stocks since January with 12-month forward earnings
falling to 13.8, Florence Chernyak-Bosson, an analyst at Indosuez, wonders whether these low
valuations ""could trigger new buy orders, especially from global value funds"". 
    She's quick to note though that ""cheap does not necessarily imply a bargain"" and that
European shares, to get more expensive, need political risk and trade war fears out of the way. 
    And perhaps more crucially than anything else: rising profits translating into earnings
revisions. 
   ""At the current juncture, such a combination of positive factors is possible, but not
expected"", Chernyak-Bosson writes. 
    She adds that ""emerging markets seem better positioned to benefit from renewed investor
interest from a 'value' standpoint, as they remain cheaper than European equities and have
experienced a more marked sell-off in recent months.""
    As you can see below, the euro zone is the most seriously unloved region of 2018:

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

assess Italy's draft budget for 2019 only but do so in the
context of its economic forecasts for growth, debt and deficit

Wednesday.
    The Commission said earlier this week that Rome's planned
budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2019, 2020 and 2021 was
breaking EU budget rules, because it meant Italy would not be
cutting its structural deficit or huge public debt.
    Rome responded on Wednesday by saying it would keep the
deficit in 2019 at 2.4 but could agree to reduce the gap in 2020
and 2021.
    Asked if the Commission would assess Italy's budget only for
2019 when Rome submits its draft to Brussels on Oct 15th, or
also the deficit plan for 2020 and 2021, the spokesman said the
assessment would concern only 2019.
    He added it would do so in the context of the Commission's
own economic forecasts for 2020 and 2021.

 (Updates with Italy budget plan delay)
    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy's government bond yields
fell on Wednesday on reports that Rome plans to cut the budget
deficit faster than it had previously indicated, easing fears
about the fiscal policy of the euro zone's third-biggest
economy.
    Rome foresees the budget deficit falling to 2.2 percent of
gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the
2.4 percent expected next year, a government source from the
right-wing League said on Wednesday [nI6N1VP01Z].    
    That bought relief to the bond market, the euro and stocks. 
    Later in the session, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
appeared to confirm the source-based report, saying Italy's
budget deficit will fall gradually from 2020 [nR1N1VZ00T].
    Debt markets, in particular, have taken a beating since the
coalition government - of which the League is a member - said
last week it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP over
the next three years, tripling the previous target.
    Italian borrowing costs were lower on Wednesday after four
days of sharp rises <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>, but off lows hit in
early trade, as a note of caution crept back in.
    The Italian government's multi-year budget plan will not be
published on Wednesday, government sources said, as ministers
continue to discuss the economic and fiscal targets.[nR1N1VZ00U]

     The 10-year Italian government bond yield was down 5 bps at
3.38 percent <IT10YT=RR>, below Tuesday's 4 1/2-year high around
3.46 percent. 
    That left the gap over benchmark German bond yields
<DE10YT=RR>, a closely followed indicator of relative country
risks, at 294 bps versus 300 bps late Tuesday.
    ""The deficit forecast news is main reason markets are doing
what they are doing today,"" said KBC rates strategist Mathias
van der Jeugt.
    ""But this is too little to bridge the gap between the EU and
Italy. We might get some more relief, but I think it will be
short-lived unless Italy comes up with a better proposal that is
more aligned with what the EU wants.""
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which only emerged from its third international bailout
in August [nL8N1WI4KW]. 
    ""Let's not forget the yield is pretty high, so there is a
carry element as well, so people latch on to any news flow that
may be coming through,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment
strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, referring to
the recovery in Italian bonds. 
    UBS Wealth said that it now saw two-year Italian bonds as
attractive after the heavy selloff [nL8N1WJ1CP].
    The euro <EUR=> and stocks also benefited from the more
positive noises coming from Rome. Italian shares rose 1.2
percent <.FTMIB>, outperforming European stocks overall
<.STOXX>.    
    As Italy's bond market rebounded, yields on higher-rated
euro zone bonds rose. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up 2 bps
at 0.44 percent.

    WILL BRUSSELS ACCEPT ROME'S BUDGET OLIVE BRANCH? (1207 GMT)
    Markets are bouncing back today on relief after the Italian government signalled it would
lower its budget deficit target from 2020, appearing to backtrack from initial plans that
spooked investors earlier this week.
    That has fuelled some hopes that Rome could avert a big clash with the EU Commission over
its spending plans but arguably it is still too early to uncork the champagne.
    Some investors are ready to snap up Italian bargains (See UBS' overweight on 2-yr Italian
govvies [nL8N1WJ1CP]) after a sell-off that seems to have gone too far, but a high degree of
caution remains. And that's mirrored in the cash market's thin trading activity.
    A Switzerland-based trader says the problem is that the 2019 deficit target remains at 2.4
percent and that's likely to be a major problem for the EU Commission.
   ""It would be surprising if Brussels were to suddenly sound supportive just because the
targets further out have been improved,"" the trader says.
    And right on cue, an EU official has indeed said: ""Targets for 2020 and 2021 are not part of
our assessment"". [nL8N1WJ2ZN]
    Of course details of Italy's budget plan may play a big role but it seems we're still not
going to have them today: [nR1N1VZ00U].
    For Alessandro Balsotti, fund manager at JCI Capital in Milan, the key issue for Brussels
will be how Italy is going to pay for fiscal expansion.
    ""My impression is that our government is making a risky albeit somewhat rational bet: Europe
could not afford to be with Italy as inflexible as it was with Greece. Italy is not Greece.""

    EUROPEAN EQUITIES: CHEAP ISN'T BEAUTIFUL (1050 GMT)
    How cheap until European shares become irresistible?
    A lot has been said about the divergence between Wall Street's buoyant indexes and Europe's
red-tainted bourses and whether that gap can be filled.
    Noting a ""sharp de-rating"" of European stocks since January with 12-month forward earnings
falling to 13.8, Florence Chernyak-Bosson, an analyst at Indosuez, wonders whether these low
valuations ""could trigger new buy orders, especially from global value funds"". 
    She's quick to note though that ""cheap does not necessarily imply a bargain"" and that
European shares, to get more expensive, need political risk and trade war fears out of the way. 
    And perhaps more crucially than anything else: rising profits translating into earnings
revisions. 
   ""At the current juncture, such a combination of positive factors is possible, but not
expected"", Chernyak-Bosson writes. 
    She adds that ""emerging markets seem better positioned to benefit from renewed investor
interest from a 'value' standpoint, as they remain cheaper than European equities and have
experienced a more marked sell-off in recent months.""

    REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT EUROPEAN STOCKS (1002 GMT)
    There's growing evidence the trade war is hurting global economic activity, and European
stocks remain in thrall of politics, but Barclays analysts still find reasons to be cheerful. 
    ""Positioning on Europe appears to be particularly bearish and it is the only region to have
seen net outflows year-to-date,"" they note, but they see positives outweighing the negatives and
expect ""modest upside"" into the end of the year. 
    Fundamentals are supportive overall, they maintain. Here are their reasons to be cheerful: 
    * Global growth should be resilient in 2018 at around 4%
    * Earnings revisions are on the right track
    * P/E multiples have fallen 
    * Investors have derisked and sentiment is cautious, but Q4 is typically more positive
    * FX is turning into a support again for the euro zone and UK

    As you can see below, after cyclicals underperformed over Q3, they've started coming back
again as the Citi economic surprise indicator for the euro zone bottomed out. 
    Barclays back cyclical stocks and have a couple of pretty contrarian calls including
overweight financials and autos - but on the big issue of the day, Italy, they remain negative:
""We expect Italy to enter a prolonged period of volatility, which is unlikely to help  European
markets"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN RELIEF HELPS EUROPE BOUNCE BACK (0727 GMT)
    Reports that the Italian government aims to lower its budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 from
the 2.4 percent targeted for next year [nI6N1VP01Z] is spreading some optimism among investors,

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

    MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Former International Monetary Fund
chief Rodrigo Rato will have to serve a four-and-a-half year
jail sentence for misusing company credit cards when he worked
at state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>, Spain's Supreme Court
confirmed on Wednesday.
    Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent
figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the
IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state
bailout in 2012.
    In 2017, the court considered Rato responsible for
overseeing the misuse of credit cards and said he could have
reversed the practice that involved dozens of other executives
and board members of Bankia.
    Rato had appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing,
arguing the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were
legal.
    The case is one of several high-level corruption
investigations now coming to fruition and has been seen as a
test of whether Spain's rich and powerful are accountable before
the law.

    DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE: ALONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR (0915
AM EDT/1315 GMT)
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> closed at a fresh
all-time high on Tuesday. That said, in so doing, it lacked
dance partners. Indeed, no other major average was able to tag
along.
    Of 11 other major indices including the S&P 500 <.SPX>,
Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> and Russell 2000 <.RUT>, not one was
able to confirm the DJI's record high close.
    These other indices find themselves on average about 2.6
percent shy of a record close. The NYSE Composite <.NYA> has yet
to even surpass its January peak, and remains about 4 percent
below that level.
    Even within the DJI itself, only 3 members closed a new
record on Tuesday: Boeing <BA.N>, Apple <AAPL.O> and
UnitedHealth <UNH.N>.
    Nevertheless, if the Dow can extend to channel resistance
derived from a support line off the late-June low, it can still
extend to the 27,000 area. (Click  on chart below)
    An immediate reversal below September's close (26,458.31),
however, can suggest the index is tripping up, and breaking the
Sept. 26 low at 26,349.34 can inflict greater damage.

    It's plain sailing so far today on European stock markets with the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> moving

appeared to soften plans for fiscal expansion.

    WILL BRUSSELS ACCEPT ROME'S BUDGET OLIVE BRANCH? (1207 GMT)
    Markets are bouncing back today on relief after the Italian government signalled it would
lower its budget deficit target from 2020, appearing to backtrack from initial plans that
spooked investors earlier this week.
    That has fuelled some hopes that Rome could avert a big clash with the EU Commission over
its spending plans but arguably it is still too early to uncork the champagne.
    Some investors are ready to snap up Italian bargains (See UBS' overweight on 2-yr Italian
govvies [nL8N1WJ1CP]) after a sell-off that seems to have gone too far, but a high degree of
caution remains. And that's mirrored in the cash market's thin trading activity.
    A Switzerland-based trader says the problem is that the 2019 deficit target remains at 2.4
percent and that's likely to be a major problem for the EU Commission.
   ""It would be surprising if Brussels were to suddenly sound supportive just because the
targets further out have been improved,"" the trader says.
    And right on cue, an EU official has indeed said: ""Targets for 2020 and 2021 are not part of
our assessment"". [nL8N1WJ2ZN]
    Of course details of Italy's budget plan may play a big role but it seems we're still not
going to have them today: [nR1N1VZ00U].
    For Alessandro Balsotti, fund manager at JCI Capital in Milan, the key issue for Brussels
will be how Italy is going to pay for fiscal expansion.
    ""My impression is that our government is making a risky albeit somewhat rational bet: Europe
could not afford to be with Italy as inflexible as it was with Greece. Italy is not Greece.""

    EUROPEAN EQUITIES: CHEAP ISN'T BEAUTIFUL (1050 GMT)
    How cheap until European shares become irresistible?
    A lot has been said about the divergence between Wall Street's buoyant indexes and Europe's
red-tainted bourses and whether that gap can be filled.
    Noting a ""sharp de-rating"" of European stocks since January with 12-month forward earnings
falling to 13.8, Florence Chernyak-Bosson, an analyst at Indosuez, wonders whether these low
valuations ""could trigger new buy orders, especially from global value funds"". 
    She's quick to note though that ""cheap does not necessarily imply a bargain"" and that
European shares, to get more expensive, need political risk and trade war fears out of the way. 
    And perhaps more crucially than anything else: rising profits translating into earnings
revisions. 
   ""At the current juncture, such a combination of positive factors is possible, but not
expected"", Chernyak-Bosson writes. 
    She adds that ""emerging markets seem better positioned to benefit from renewed investor
interest from a 'value' standpoint, as they remain cheaper than European equities and have
experienced a more marked sell-off in recent months.""

    REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT EUROPEAN STOCKS (1002 GMT)
    There's growing evidence the trade war is hurting global economic activity, and European
stocks remain in thrall of politics, but Barclays analysts still find reasons to be cheerful. 
    ""Positioning on Europe appears to be particularly bearish and it is the only region to have
seen net outflows year-to-date,"" they note, but they see positives outweighing the negatives and
expect ""modest upside"" into the end of the year. 
    Fundamentals are supportive overall, they maintain. Here are their reasons to be cheerful: 
    * Global growth should be resilient in 2018 at around 4%
    * Earnings revisions are on the right track
    * P/E multiples have fallen 
    * Investors have derisked and sentiment is cautious, but Q4 is typically more positive
    * FX is turning into a support again for the euro zone and UK

    As you can see below, after cyclicals underperformed over Q3, they've started coming back
again as the Citi economic surprise indicator for the euro zone bottomed out. 
    Barclays back cyclical stocks and have a couple of pretty contrarian calls including
overweight financials and autos - but on the big issue of the day, Italy, they remain negative:
""We expect Italy to enter a prolonged period of volatility, which is unlikely to help  European
markets"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN RELIEF HELPS EUROPE BOUNCE BACK (0727 GMT)
    Reports that the Italian government aims to lower its budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 from
the 2.4 percent targeted for next year [nI6N1VP01Z] is spreading some optimism among investors,
helping European and Italian stocks rebound after a turbulent start of the week.
    The STOXX 600 <.STOXX> is rising 0.3 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB is bouncing up more than 1
percent and almost all sectors are trading in the black. Activity was reduced by the closure of
the DAX.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

 (Adds German comment, Conservative member)
    By Elizabeth Piper, William James and Kylie MacLellan
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 3 (Reuters) - British Prime
Minister Theresa May appealed to her Conservative Party on
Wednesday to unite behind her plan to leave the European Union,
warning critics their arguments could put Brexit in jeopardy.
    On the final day of her party's annual conference, May
sought to rally members by addressing their concerns that the
Conservatives are becoming increasingly directionless under the
weight of Brexit, urging them to look to a brighter future.
    Dancing onto the stage in the city of Birmingham to ABBA's
""Dancing Queen"" and a standing ovation, May poked fun at herself
after her dance moves were mocked on a trip to Africa and after
last year's conference when her speech was disrupted by a
coughing fit, a stage intruder and a collapsing background set.
    It was a warm welcome for a leader whose fragile position at
the helm of her party has come under further pressure after the
EU rejected parts of her so-called Chequers plan and critics
stepped up calls for her to ditch her strategy on Brexit,
Britain's most far-reaching policy shift for more than 40 years.
    With just six months before Britain is due to exit the EU,
she has so far weathered the Brexit storm, shrugging off a
barnstorming speech by her ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson
that did little to hide his leadership ambitions.  [nL8N1WH6ZA]
    On Wednesday, May was keen to show she was in charge of the
Brexit talks.
    ""If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our
own vision of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no
Brexit at all,"" she said, a rebuff to eurosceptic lawmakers who
have published their alternatives plan for leaving the EU.
    ""And there's another reason why we need to come together. We
are entering the toughest part of the negotiations...If we stick
together and hold our nerve, I know we can get a deal that
delivers for Britain.""
    She also tried to return to the message she gave when she
was appointed prime minister in 2016, promising to help those
who feel ""left behind"" and pledging to end her government's
austerity push after nearly a decade of spending cuts.
[nL8N1WJ3KD]
    And in another rallying cry for unity, she repeatedly
attacked the main opposition Labour Party, saying their
policies, including a renationalisation of mail, rail and
utilities, would mean increased taxes and business flight.
    Hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, she said, would
""outsource our conscience to the Kremlin"".
    
    UNITY?
    Her words were aimed at easing the growing frustration of
some Conservatives who openly say their party is meandering
without substantive new ideas, unable to set an agenda amid
their divisive feuds over how to depart the EU.
    The heat she faces from some in the party was underlined
less than an hour before her speech when Conservative lawmaker
James Duddridge said he had submitted a letter calling on her to
resign. Forty-eight such letters are needed to trigger a vote of
confidence in the leader. [nL9N1W700I]
    Her spokesman declined to comment on Duddridge's move.
    But Wednesday's speech seemed to have gone down well among
the party faithful.
    Jeremy Hunt, her foreign minister, said on Twitter:
""Congratulations Theresa May for a remarkable speech delivered
with humour and passion. Firmness of purpose, clarity and
conviction - EU friends do not underestimate!""
    Pro-Brexit party activist Paul Whitehouse told Reuters: ""She
did enough to rally the grassroots and that will be momentum
enough for cracks to be paved over to a certain extent.""
    Taking a swipe at hardline eurosceptic Johnson, May said she
was making decisions on Brexit in the ""national interest"" - a
nod to her argument that her former foreign secretary's
alternative Brexit proposals would tear the United Kingdom apart
by placing Northern Ireland under EU customs rules and thereby
detaching it from the rest of Britain.  
    ""It is no surprise that we have had a range of different
views expressed this week,"" May said. ""But my job as prime
minister is to do what I believe to be in the national
interest.""
    With no agreement with the bloc over the terms of divorce or
a future trade relationship, the last day of the conference
marked the beginning of what some officials predict will be a
frenzied couple of weeks of diplomacy between London and
Brussels as the two sides try to pin down a deal. [nL8N1WI4Y0]
    May and her team face weeks of difficult conversations with
Brussels, especially after Hunt offended some in the bloc by
comparing the EU to the old Soviet Union in asserting that the
EU was trying to ""punish"" any member seeking to leave it.
    ""Brexit fans have their backs to the wall,"" said Franziska
Brantner, European affairs spokeswoman for Germany's Greens
party. ""Blaming the EU won't help them.""
    At home it won't be any easier.
    May faces challenges from her own party and from the small
party propping up her minority government, Northern Ireland's
Democratic Unionist Party, which has repeated that it will not
accept a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the
United Kingdom. [nL9N1W700E]
    In her speech, May stuck to her plan, but did not call it by
its moniker - Chequers - named after the prime ministerial
country residence where she hashed out the proposals in July.
    ""So this is our proposal. Taking back control of our
borders, laws and money. Good for jobs, good for the Union. It
delivers the referendum, it keeps faith with the British
people.""

    By Catarina Demony
    LISBON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Europe's largest tech event, the
Web Summit, will remain in Lisbon for another 10 years, its
founder Paddy Cosgrave said on Wednesday in a boost to
Portugal's aspirations of becoming a technology hub.
    Under the agreement, Portugal's government will pay Web
Summit 11 million euros a year to expand the venue, anticipating
that the number of participants will increase from 70,000 last
year to 100,000 eventually. 
    ""Staying here for another 10 years brings us so much
certainty,"" Cosgrave told journalists at a press conference
where he was joined by Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.
""My heart and the team's heart is in Lisbon.""
    Lisbon scored a big coup when Web Summit moved from Dublin
to Portugal in 2016, helping a recovery in the country's capital
after the 2011-2014 debt crisis.
    When Web Summit was launched in Dublin in 2010 it had 400
participants. It now draws speakers from leading global tech
companies and politicians, as well as tech entrepreneurs hoping
to attract attention to their startups.
    ""It puts Portugal at the heart of the global conversation
about tech and innovation,"" Costa said.
    The government estimates that the event itself generates 300
million euros ($347 million) for Lisbon in hotel and other
revenue during the week it takes place in November. 
    The agreement with Portugal obliges Web Summit to pay the
country 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) if it were to decide to
leave before the end of 10 years. This amount is the minimum
expected economic boost for Portugal from hosting the event,
said a statement.
    The original idea was for Web Summit to stay for three years
in Lisbon and then move to other European venues. More than 20
European cities competed to host Web Summit.
    The event is held in the pavilions built for Lisbon's 1998
World Fair.

    ASTON MARTIN: OVERHYPED? (1402 GMT)
    When asking investors and traders why the Aston Martin IPO flopped so badly today, one word
keeps coming up: ""overhyped"". The carmaker had high hopes of clinching a market cap of 4.33
billion pounds, pricing its shares at 19 pounds each. But it was last down 5.2 percent at 18
pounds. 
    ""There was a lot of hype. People were trying to get it away on similar multiples to Ferrari
or a luxury good,"" says one trader. Ferrari trades on an eye-watering 39x price to earnings
multiple - compared with 24.25 for LVMH and 5.99 for BMW.
    ""I think the market is taking the view that [Aston] is a car company,"" he continues. And
it's not a good time to be a car company, certainly, with the threat of tariffs hanging over.
    Some are connecting it also to the 'B' word hanging over the UK market, which some say has
dampened IPO activity and interest. 
    ""I wonder if other factors like Brexit too are spooking people piling into anything at the
moment,"" says another trader. 
    Barrick Gold's acquisition of Randgold Resources is also a blow to the UK market as Randgold
will delist from the FTSE 100 after 21 years, the second mining company to announce its
departure from the London stock exchange in three months following Vedanta Resources.

    WILL BRUSSELS ACCEPT ROME'S BUDGET OLIVE BRANCH? (1207 GMT)
    Markets are bouncing back today on relief after the Italian government signalled it would
lower its budget deficit target from 2020, appearing to backtrack from initial plans that
spooked investors earlier this week.
    That has fuelled some hopes that Rome could avert a big clash with the EU Commission over
its spending plans but arguably it is still too early to uncork the champagne.
    Some investors are ready to snap up Italian bargains (See UBS' overweight on 2-yr Italian
govvies [nL8N1WJ1CP]) after a sell-off that seems to have gone too far, but a high degree of
caution remains. And that's mirrored in the cash market's thin trading activity.
    A Switzerland-based trader says the problem is that the 2019 deficit target remains at 2.4
percent and that's likely to be a major problem for the EU Commission.
   ""It would be surprising if Brussels were to suddenly sound supportive just because the
targets further out have been improved,"" the trader says.
    And right on cue, an EU official has indeed said: ""Targets for 2020 and 2021 are not part of
our assessment"". [nL8N1WJ2ZN]
    Of course details of Italy's budget plan may play a big role but it seems we're still not
going to have them today: [nR1N1VZ00U].
    For Alessandro Balsotti, fund manager at JCI Capital in Milan, the key issue for Brussels
will be how Italy is going to pay for fiscal expansion.
    ""My impression is that our government is making a risky albeit somewhat rational bet: Europe
could not afford to be with Italy as inflexible as it was with Greece. Italy is not Greece.""

    EUROPEAN EQUITIES: CHEAP ISN'T BEAUTIFUL (1050 GMT)
    How cheap until European shares become irresistible?
    A lot has been said about the divergence between Wall Street's buoyant indexes and Europe's
red-tainted bourses and whether that gap can be filled.
    Noting a ""sharp de-rating"" of European stocks since January with 12-month forward earnings
falling to 13.8, Florence Chernyak-Bosson, an analyst at Indosuez, wonders whether these low
valuations ""could trigger new buy orders, especially from global value funds"". 
    She's quick to note though that ""cheap does not necessarily imply a bargain"" and that
European shares, to get more expensive, need political risk and trade war fears out of the way. 
    And perhaps more crucially than anything else: rising profits translating into earnings
revisions. 
   ""At the current juncture, such a combination of positive factors is possible, but not
expected"", Chernyak-Bosson writes. 
    She adds that ""emerging markets seem better positioned to benefit from renewed investor
interest from a 'value' standpoint, as they remain cheaper than European equities and have
experienced a more marked sell-off in recent months.""

    REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT EUROPEAN STOCKS (1002 GMT)
    There's growing evidence the trade war is hurting global economic activity, and European
stocks remain in thrall of politics, but Barclays analysts still find reasons to be cheerful. 
    ""Positioning on Europe appears to be particularly bearish and it is the only region to have
seen net outflows year-to-date,"" they note, but they see positives outweighing the negatives and
expect ""modest upside"" into the end of the year. 
    Fundamentals are supportive overall, they maintain. Here are their reasons to be cheerful: 
    * Global growth should be resilient in 2018 at around 4%
    * Earnings revisions are on the right track
    * P/E multiples have fallen 
    * Investors have derisked and sentiment is cautious, but Q4 is typically more positive
    * FX is turning into a support again for the euro zone and UK

    As you can see below, after cyclicals underperformed over Q3, they've started coming back
again as the Citi economic surprise indicator for the euro zone bottomed out. 
    Barclays back cyclical stocks and have a couple of pretty contrarian calls including
overweight financials and autos - but on the big issue of the day, Italy, they remain negative:
""We expect Italy to enter a prolonged period of volatility, which is unlikely to help  European
markets"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN RELIEF HELPS EUROPE BOUNCE BACK (0727 GMT)
    Reports that the Italian government aims to lower its budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 from

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Former International Monetary Fund
chief Rodrigo Rato will have to serve a four-and-a-half year
jail sentence for misusing company credit cards when he worked
at state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>, Spain's Supreme Court
confirmed on Wednesday.
    Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent
figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the
IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state
bailout in 2012.
    In 2017, the court considered Rato responsible for
overseeing the misuse of credit cards and said he could have
reversed the practice that involved dozens of other executives
and board members of Bankia.
    Rato had appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing,
arguing the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were
legal.
    On Wednesday the Supreme Court said in its 456-page ruling
that it considered the sentence to be proportionate due to
Rato's preeminent position at Bankia from whose assets he had
""profited unfairly and allowed others to profit"".
    Rato's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.
    The case is one of several high-level corruption
investigations now coming to fruition and seen as a test of
whether Spain's rich and powerful are accountable before the
law.
    The so-called ""black cards"" case sparked widespread anger
when the scandal first broke in 2014, at a time when Spain was
recovering from years of recession, mass layoffs and a banking
crisis partly triggered by Bankia's massive bailout.
    The cards were used to buy jewels, holidays and expensive
clothes, according to documents filed with Spain's High Court,
but also to fund more mundane purchases such as trips to the
cinema.
    The Supreme Court confirmed the jail sentences of between
four months and more than four years for 64 former Bankia
executives, including Rato.
    In total, prosecutors investigated some 12 million euros in
spending on the cards between 2003 and 2012.
    Before chairing the Washington-based IMF between 2004 and
2007, Rato was deputy prime minister in Spain's conservative 
government in 1996.

    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, according to the
country's central bank.
    The European Union member country has been rocked by
revelations that banks there laundered money from Russia,
Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank accounts. The
scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and neighbouring Latvia to
shut down.
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all flows, including resident and
non-resident transactions, a spokesman said. 
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the flows suspicious.
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident, cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    A central bank spokesman told Reuters the bank does not have
specific data for non-resident transactions.
    Nordic banking shares fell after the Bloomberg report.
Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking operations in
Estonia, were trading 5.4 percent and 7.2 percent lower,
respectively.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market.
Swedbank declined to comment.
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

    WARSAW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Ireland does not want a notional
border to emerge in the Irish Sea that would divide Northern
Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom, Irish Foreign
Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday.
    Brexit negotiators are seeking to resolve a standoff over
how to prevent the return of border checks between Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland by looking at how regulatory
checks on some goods between the two islands could be used as
part of a solution to move talks forward. [nL8N1WI4Y0]
    Dublin is trying to convince pro-British politicians in
Northern Ireland that this would not amount to a constitutional
challenge to the British province's status, prompting Coveney's
remarks at a news conference during a visit to Warsaw.
    ""We don't want to see any border on the Irish Sea but the
commitment to an Irish backstop of last December is very clear,""
Coveney said, referring to the ""insurance policy"" backstop
arrangement all sides agreed to in principle over how to retain
an open border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.
    ""We are not trying to create new barriers to trade between
Northern Ireland and the (rest of the) United Kingdom. We
believe it is possible to find the balance and the compromise to
get this done... Ireland is happy to show some flexibility.""
    The small Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
that props up Britain's minority Conservative government
strongly resists any suggestion that there may need to be
regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of
the UK after Brexit.
    DUP leader Arlene Foster described it earlier on Wednesday
as a ""blood red"" line, in a ratcheting-up of the party's
rhetoric. [nL9N1W700E]

    * Interior minister chaffed against Macron' Jupiterian style

    By Richard Lough
    PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - France's Emmanuel Macron faced
mounting questions about the durability of his government on
Wednesday after the resignation of a third minister in five
weeks, testing the political newcomer's ability to hold an
administration together.
    Gerard Collomb, 71, a former Socialist Party stalwart who
backed Macron early in his presidential bid and was seen as a
mentor, resigned after a public battle of wills with 40-year-old
Macron. [nL8N1WI585] 
    The loss of a close ally and one of the most senior
ministers in the government is a heavy blow for the president,
whose popularity has fallen sharply in opinion polls and is
struggling to inject new energy into his reform drive.
    In refusing to toe the line after Macron at first rejected
his resignation, Collomb ended up exposing the president's
relative political inexperience, commentators said.
    ""This is a challenge to Macron's Jupiterian way of trying to
run the presidency,"" said Jonathan Fenby, author of The History
of Modern France, referring to Macron's early casting of himself
as a Jupiter-like figure - one who sits above the political fray
and hands down messages like the Roman god of gods.
    As Collomb formally handed his portfolio to Prime Minister
Edouard Philippe at an icy ceremony on Wednesday, tensions were
barely disguised.
    Collomb's subdued demeanour appeared to reflect the poor
relations that have existed since a scandal erupted in July over
an Elysee Palace bodyguard caught on camera beating protesters.
The Elysee's slow response tainted Macron's transparent image. 
    Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told heckling
lawmakers on Wednesday that there was no crisis. But Macron and
Philippe now face a delicate balancing act as they search for a
new interior minister from a political party without deep roots,
one formed around Macron's start-up presidential campaign.
    The president has already lost his popular environment
minister and the sports minister, though Collomb's problems
mainly lay with Macron's seeming arrogance, while policy
differences are at the heart of the departure of the two other
ministers.[nL8N1W40RV]
    ""He doesn't have the strength in depth that an established
party would have,"" said Fenby.
    
    ""LACK OF HUMILITY""
    While a full-on government collapse is unlikely, the
drip-drip of resignations has hindered Macron's ability to push
ahead with reforms on a tight schedule. Macron himself does not
face a re-election challenge until 2022.
    Collomb, who had spoken of a ""lack of humility"" inside
Macron's team, first announced his desire to resign in a
magazine interview two weeks ago, implying he would step down in
2019 to run as mayor of Lyon after the European elections. 
    Opponents were quick to berate Macron for trying to hold on
to a lame-duck minister who has to preside over one of France's
most sensitive portfolios. The country is still reeling from
militant attacks that have killed some 240 people since 2015. 
    ""Things have badly deteriorated,"" Collomb said on Wednesday,
standing alongside Philippe and referring to conditions in the
rundown suburbs of France's biggest cities. 
    ""Today, it's not the rule of the Republic that prevails but
rather of drug traffickers and radical Islamists.""
    Macron's advisers made clear the timing of Collomb's
departure would be on their terms. But on Tuesday, Collomb
insisted on quitting his post, backing Macron into a corner and
forcing him to agree.
    ""If (Collomb) wanted to show ... that the head of state had
lost his control of events and that he lacked the experience and
indispensable reflexes needed for his job, the ex-minister could
not have done it any better,"" Le Monde wrote in an editorial.

neighbouring Latvia to shut down.
    The scale of the cross-border flows, first report by
Bloomberg, suggests that money laundering through the small
Baltic country may have been larger then previously thought. The
news sent Nordic banking shares sharply lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27

non-resident transactions, a spokesman said. 
    Estonia's entire GDP is only about $23 billion.
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of

non-resident cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    A central bank spokesman told Reuters the bank does not have

    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Danish expert on money
laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates that the
Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the problem related
to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 5.4 percent and 7.2 percent
lower, respectively.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,
according to its website. 
    Its Nordic rival SEB <SEBa.ST> also has major operations in
the Baltics after acquisitions in the late 1990s. It had 920,000
private and 99,000 corporate customers according to its 2017
annual report. 
    ""We have very few if any customers that are not based in the
Baltic countries,"" an SEB spokesman said. ""We feel satisfied
that our process concerning these issues works.""
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

 (Updates prices, adds new landmark on Italian yields)
    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
fell sharply on Wednesday on reports that Rome plans to cut the
budget deficit faster than it had previously indicated, easing
fears about the fiscal policy of the euro zone's third-biggest
economy.
    Rome foresees the budget deficit falling to 2.2 percent of
gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the
2.4 percent expected next year, a government source from the
right-wing League said on Wednesday [nI6N1VP01Z].    
    That bought relief to the bond market, the euro and stocks. 
    Later in the session, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
appeared to confirm the report, saying Italy's budget deficit
will fall gradually from 2020 [nR1N1VZ00T].
    Debt markets, in particular, have taken a beating since the
coalition government - of which the League is a member - said
last week it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP over
the next three years, tripling the previous target.
    Italian borrowing costs were lower on Wednesday after four
days of sharp rises, and short-dated yields even recorded their
biggest daily fall since early June, down 22-23 basis points.
<IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>
    The Italian government's multi-year budget plan will not be
published on Wednesday, government sources said, as ministers
continue to discuss the economic and fiscal targets.[nR1N1VZ00U]

     The 10-year Italian government bond yield was down 12 bps
at 3.31 percent <IT10YT=RR>, well below Tuesday's 4 1/2-year
high around 3.46 percent. 
    That left the gap over benchmark German bond yields
<DE10YT=RR>, a closely-followed indicator of relative country
risks, at 283 bps versus 300 bps late Tuesday.
    ""The deficit forecast news is main reason markets are doing
what they are doing today,"" said KBC rates strategist Mathias
van der Jeugt.
    ""But this is too little to bridge the gap between the EU and
Italy. We might get some more relief, but I think it will be
short-lived unless Italy comes up with a better proposal that is
more aligned with what the EU wants.""
    EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels
on Monday between Italy's budget plans and the finances of
Greece, which only emerged from its third international bailout
in August [nL8N1WI4KW]. 
    ""Let's not forget the yield is pretty high, so there is a
carry element as well, so people latch on to any news flow that
may be coming through,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment
strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, referring to
the recovery in Italian bonds. 
    UBS Wealth said that it now saw two-year Italian bonds as
attractive after the heavy selloff [nL8N1WJ1CP].
    The euro <EUR=> and stocks also benefited from the more
positive noises coming from Rome. Italian shares rose 1.2
percent <.FTMIB>, outperforming European stocks overall
<.STOXX>.    
    As Italy's bond market rebounded, yields on higher-rated
euro zone bonds rose. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up 6 bps
at 0.48 percent by the close.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italian stocks turned from a drag
into a boost for European markets on Wednesday as signs the
government would target a lower budget deficit quelled
investors' fears of a damaging showdown with the European
Commission.
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> outperformed and closed up 0.9
percent while the leading euro zone stocks index <.STOXX50E> and
the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> climbed 0.8 percent and 0.6
percent respectively.
    Italian government bond yields fell back thanks to reports
the government was targeting a lower budget deficit in 2020 and
2021.[nL8N1WJ0NR]
    European banks <.SX7P> which were benefiting from the easing
tensions in Italy gave up most of their gains in late afternoon
trading. 
    The country's central bank said lenders doing business in
Estonia, which has been at the center of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017. 
    The European banking index <.SX7P> lost about one percent on
the news and ended the day only up 0.5 percent while Sweden's
SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking operations in Estonia,
closed down 3.3 percent and 5.8 percent lower respectively.
    Oslo-listed aluminum firm Norsk Hydro <NHY.OL> was the
biggest individual faller, tumbling 11.9 percent after
announcing it would shut all output from its Alunorte alumina
refinery in Brazil. [nFWN1WJ031]
    ""This is a very serious event for Norsk Hydro, potentially
leading to severe losses,"" said a trader.
    Grifols <GRLS.MC> shares fell 5.8 percent after UBS analysts
cut the stock to sell from neutral, saying competitive risks are
rising.
    ""Fc Rn inhibitors, a new class of drug we expect to launch
in 2021, threaten to replace up to 20 percent of Grifols sales,""
said analysts at the Swiss bank. 
    Tesco <TSCO.L> shares fell 8.6 percent after Britain's
biggest retailer reported first-half profits which missed
analysts' forecasts. [nL8N1WJ0T9]
    ""Good like-for-like (sales), but weak bottom line points to
margin destruction,"" said a trader. 
    Shares in French tech consultancy Altran <ALTT.PA> jumped
9.1 percent, at the top of the STOXX after Kepler Cheuvreux
analysts upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"" with a price
target of 10 euros.
    Kepler analysts said they see no risk for liquidity, and
that Altran's current share price values its global design and
engineering company Aricent at roughly 0. 
    The stock, down 40 percent in the third quarter alone, is a
popular short, amplifying any positive moves as short-sellers
unwind their positions.

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union
must focus on getting a divorce deal with an Irish border fix
before they embark on discussions on their post-Brexit trade
ties, the Czech Republic's pointman on Europe said. 
    Britain is due to leave the EU in 177 days but talks on
managing the unprecedented split have stalled over differences
on how to avoid border checks between EU-member Ireland and
Britain's province of Northern Ireland.
    Officials expect a flurry of negotiations after Wednesday's
speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May closing the annual
Conservative Party conference [nL8N1WJ1NV] as both sides seek to
break the deadlock in time for an EU summit in two weeks.
    ""The chief concern for the EU right now is reaching a deal
on the Withdrawal Agreement that would provide us with a two
year transition period in which to set out the future
relationship between the EU and the UK,"" State Secretary for
European Affairs Ales Chmelar said, adding divorce must cover an
Irish fix. 
    Britain's preferred option is focusing on agreeing close
future trade ties. London wants this post-Brexit arrangement to
regulate the Irish border but the bloc wants an emergency
solution if trade talks fail or take longer.
    ""The future relationship ... is a matter for future
discussions. Without the Withdrawal Agreement we are, very soon,
heading towards a no-deal scenario in which a hard border would
inevitably be drawn up,"" Chmelar said. 
    As both sides ready concessions, Britain is expected to
present a new proposal for the Irish border soon. 
    The other 27 EU member states will put in writing for the
first time next week their free trade proposal for Britain for
after Brexit, hoping a more fleshed-out promise would woo London
into compromises on Ireland and help May get enough support
behind any divorce deal. 
    However, EU negotiators are also keen to maintain the
""sequencing"" used to keep up pressure on London to first deal
with the Irish issue in order to ensure a smooth exit from the
bloc before Brussels will fully engage on a future trade deal.
    The 27 leaders scheduled a crunch summit dinner in Brussels
for Wednesday, Oct. 17, the evening before May joins them for a
quarterly meeting. That is the point at which the EU hopes that
the outline of an exit deal is agreed. If it is, more talks will
follow on the future relationship in the hope that a further
summit on Nov. 17-18 can wrap up both elements of the accord.
    The EU rejected London's previous fix for Ireland last June
because it envisaged only a time-limited emergency border
backstop and assumed all of the UK would remain in the EU's
customs area for a while after Brexit.
    EU diplomats and negotiating officials stress they have not
yet seen the new British plan, but warned against recasting what
was already discussed after Britain's Brexit minister Dominic
Raab told his party's conference: ""We said we would need to
retain a UK-wide customs backstop."" [nL8N1WH5X3]
    ""We will be open to looking at some of the options on
regulatory checks,"" he added, though it was not sure if that
would also cover manufactured goods.[nL8N1WH5X3]
    Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, on whose
support May relies to govern, was quick on Tuesday to reject
differing regulation to the rest of the UK after Brexit.

    BANKS: NORTHERN EUROPE AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE (1526 GMT) 
    There was a time, not long ago, where Scandinavian banks, beefed up by strong capital
ratios, seemed to be immune to the woes of their Southern euro zone neighbours, who were
suspected of having a steady supply of compliance skeletons in their cupboards. 
    Not anymore it seems, with the Estonia money laundering scandal, which affected notably
Danske Bank, hitting banking shares once again this afternoon. 
    News that banks doing business in the Baltic country handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017 spooked investors. [nL8N1WJ3YI] 
    The European banking index <.SX7P> lost about one percent since the news broke out and
Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking operations in Estonia, were trading 4.3

    ASTON MARTIN: OVERHYPED? (1402 GMT)
    When asking investors and traders why the Aston Martin IPO flopped so badly today, one word
keeps coming up: ""overhyped"". The carmaker had high hopes of clinching a market cap of 4.33
billion pounds, pricing its shares at 19 pounds each. But it was last down 5.2 percent at 18
pounds. 
    ""There was a lot of hype. People were trying to get it away on similar multiples to Ferrari
or a luxury good,"" says one trader. Ferrari trades on an eye-watering 39x price to earnings
multiple - compared with 24.25 for LVMH and 5.99 for BMW.
    ""I think the market is taking the view that [Aston] is a car company,"" he continues. And
it's not a good time to be a car company, certainly, with the threat of tariffs hanging over.
    Some are connecting it also to the 'B' word hanging over the UK market, which some say has
dampened IPO activity and interest. 
    ""I wonder if other factors like Brexit too are spooking people piling into anything at the
moment,"" says another trader. 
    Barrick Gold's acquisition of Randgold Resources is also a blow to the UK market as Randgold
will delist from the FTSE 100 after 21 years, the second mining company to announce its
departure from the London stock exchange in three months following Vedanta Resources.

    WILL BRUSSELS ACCEPT ROME'S BUDGET OLIVE BRANCH? (1207 GMT)
    Markets are bouncing back today on relief after the Italian government signalled it would
lower its budget deficit target from 2020, appearing to backtrack from initial plans that
spooked investors earlier this week.
    That has fuelled some hopes that Rome could avert a big clash with the EU Commission over
its spending plans but arguably it is still too early to uncork the champagne.
    Some investors are ready to snap up Italian bargains (See UBS' overweight on 2-yr Italian
govvies [nL8N1WJ1CP]) after a sell-off that seems to have gone too far, but a high degree of
caution remains. And that's mirrored in the cash market's thin trading activity.
    A Switzerland-based trader says the problem is that the 2019 deficit target remains at 2.4
percent and that's likely to be a major problem for the EU Commission.
   ""It would be surprising if Brussels were to suddenly sound supportive just because the
targets further out have been improved,"" the trader says.
    And right on cue, an EU official has indeed said: ""Targets for 2020 and 2021 are not part of
our assessment"". [nL8N1WJ2ZN]

going to have them today: [nR1N1VZ00U].

will be how Italy is going to pay for fiscal expansion.

    EUROPEAN EQUITIES: CHEAP ISN'T BEAUTIFUL (1050 GMT)
    How cheap until European shares become irresistible?
    A lot has been said about the divergence between Wall Street's buoyant indexes and Europe's
red-tainted bourses and whether that gap can be filled.
    Noting a ""sharp de-rating"" of European stocks since January with 12-month forward earnings
falling to 13.8, Florence Chernyak-Bosson, an analyst at Indosuez, wonders whether these low
valuations ""could trigger new buy orders, especially from global value funds"". 
    She's quick to note though that ""cheap does not necessarily imply a bargain"" and that
European shares, to get more expensive, need political risk and trade war fears out of the way. 
    And perhaps more crucially than anything else: rising profits translating into earnings
revisions. 
   ""At the current juncture, such a combination of positive factors is possible, but not
expected"", Chernyak-Bosson writes. 
    She adds that ""emerging markets seem better positioned to benefit from renewed investor
interest from a 'value' standpoint, as they remain cheaper than European equities and have
experienced a more marked sell-off in recent months.""
    As you can see below, the euro zone is the most seriously unloved region of 2018:

    REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT EUROPEAN STOCKS (1002 GMT)
    There's growing evidence the trade war is hurting global economic activity, and European
stocks remain in thrall of politics, but Barclays analysts still find reasons to be cheerful. 
    ""Positioning on Europe appears to be particularly bearish and it is the only region to have
seen net outflows year-to-date,"" they note, but they see positives outweighing the negatives and
expect ""modest upside"" into the end of the year. 
    Fundamentals are supportive overall, they maintain. Here are their reasons to be cheerful: 
    * Global growth should be resilient in 2018 at around 4%
    * Earnings revisions are on the right track
    * P/E multiples have fallen 
    * Investors have derisked and sentiment is cautious, but Q4 is typically more positive
    * FX is turning into a support again for the euro zone and UK

    As you can see below, after cyclicals underperformed over Q3, they've started coming back
again as the Citi economic surprise indicator for the euro zone bottomed out. 
    Barclays back cyclical stocks and have a couple of pretty contrarian calls including
overweight financials and autos - but on the big issue of the day, Italy, they remain negative:
""We expect Italy to enter a prolonged period of volatility, which is unlikely to help  European
markets"".

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: ITALIAN RELIEF HELPS EUROPE BOUNCE BACK (0727 GMT)
    Reports that the Italian government aims to lower its budget deficit in 2020 and 2021 from
the 2.4 percent targeted for next year [nI6N1VP01Z] is spreading some optimism among investors,
helping European and Italian stocks rebound after a turbulent start of the week.
    The STOXX 600 <.STOXX> is rising 0.3 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB is bouncing up more than 1
percent and almost all sectors are trading in the black. Activity was reduced by the closure of
the DAX.

    WHAT'S ON THE RADAR: TESCO, ASTON MARTIN, TOPPS TILES (0646 GMT)
    European stocks are set to recover some of the previous day’s losses on Wednesday, with
futures trading up 0.1 to 0.4 percent, and risk appetite could be buoyed by the Dow clinching a
new record close in U.S. trading. 
    Italy will remain a focus for investors and its bank shares could see some relief after bond
yields fell back and the spread to Bunds narrowed thanks to reports the government was targeting
a lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. The DAX is closed for a holiday, thinning out trading
across Europe.
    In results Tesco reported a 24.4 percent rise in first-half profit, with results boosted by
the contribution from newly acquired wholesaler Booker and strong summer sales. But this wasn’t
enough to impress markets: the shares are indicated down around 2 percent as the profit figures
missed analysts’ estimates by 5 percent. 
    Also on investors’ radar is the IPO of Aston Martin on the London stock exchange. The luxury
carmaker priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a valuation of $5.6 billion. 
    Surprisingly positive results from UK home improvement retailer Topps Tiles could drive the
shares up 3 to 5 percent, traders say. 
    The firm said it saw full-year profits above market expectations as trading in the fourth
quarter improved. It has been hit hard by consumers reducing big-ticket spending in the past two
years, and the stock is down 56 percent from its pre-Brexit vote levels.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES RISE, LOWER DEFICIT REPORTS BOOST ITALIAN BONDS (0617 GMT)
    European futures have started trading higher though only modestly - up 0.1 to 0.4 percent -
while the DAX is closed for a national holiday, so trading will likely be thinner than usual. 
    Part of the fuel for a rebound today could be reports that Italy's government is targeting a
lower budget deficit in 2020 and 2021. A government source just told us Italy is targeting a
budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent of GDP in 2021, from the expected 2.4
percent next year. [nI6N1VP01Z]
    That's pushed Italian bond yields back down and narrowed the spread with German Bunds -
which will likely boost Italian bank stocks. 
    Italy's Prime Minister Conte is to meet with key ministers over the budget at around 1100
GMT on Wednesday, the source also said.
    ""Italian budgetary issues are far from over,"" write Societe Generale analysts.
    ""With little on the data or supply front for bond markets to focus on on Wednesday,
political headlines are likely to remain a key driver of the bond market near-term.""

    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled more than $1 trillion in
cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, according to the
country's central bank.
    The European Union member country of just 1.3 million people
has been rocked by revelations that banks there laundered money
from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank
accounts. The scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and
neighbouring Latvia to shut down.
    The data on cross-border flows, first reported by Bloomberg,
suggests that the scale of the money laundering through the
small Baltic country may have been larger then previously
thought. The news sent Nordic banking shares sharply lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all flows, including resident and
non-resident transactions, a spokesman said. 
    Estonia's entire economic output came to about $25 billion
last year - roughly the same as that of Uganda or Nepal -
suggesting that much of the money flow was not directly linked
to economic activity in the country.
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the flows suspicious. 
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    The central bank later said the figure in the Bloomberg
report doesn't relate specifically to non-resident transactions
but to all flows in and out of the country, including imports
and exports and routine financial transactions such as
securities purchases. 
    Estonia's imports and exports totalled 232 billion euros
between 2008 and 2017, official data showed. 
    The central bank said in a statement that non-resident flows
""only make up one part of the sum,"" adding that it does not
collect separate data for those transactions.
    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Copenhagen-based expert
on money laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates
that the Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the
problem related to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 3.3 percent and 5.8 percent
lower, respectively. The region's biggest bank Nordea was
trading 2.9 percent lower, while Danske Bank, whose shares have
lost one-third of their value since March, was down 1.5 percent.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,
according to its website. 
    Its Nordic rival SEB <SEBa.ST> also has major operations in
the Baltics after acquisitions in the late 1990s. It had 920,000
private and 99,000 corporate customers according to its 2017
annual report. 
    ""We have very few if any customers that are not based in the
Baltic countries,"" an SEB spokesman said. ""We feel satisfied
that our process concerning these issues works.""
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

    DUBLIN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Facebook's <FB.O> lead regulator
in the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner
(DPC), on Wednesday commenced an investigation into a massive
cyberattack on the social networking site that the company
disclosed last week.
    Facebook said on Friday that hackers had stolen login codes
that allowed them to access nearly 50 million Facebook accounts,
its worst-ever security breach given the unprecedented level of
potential access. [nL4N1WE5P5]
    ""In particular, the investigation will examine Facebook's
compliance with its obligation under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) to implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures to ensure the security and safeguarding
of the personal data it processes,"" the DPC said in a statement.
    Under the new GDPR European privacy regulations which came
into effect in May, breaking privacy laws can result in fines of
up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever
is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros
previously.
    The DPC, which regulates a number of U.S. multinationals
with European headquarters in Dublin, said Facebook informed it
that their own internal investigation is continuing and that the
company continued to take remedial actions to mitigate the
potential risk to users.
    Facebook said on Tuesday that investigators had determined
that the hackers did not access other sites that use the social
networking site's single sign-on. [nL8N1R23NV]
    Some security experts, including a former Facebook
executive, said the company may have painted a worst-case
scenario when it disclosed the attack on Friday to ensure
compliance with the strict new European Union privacy rules.
    GDPR imposes steep penalties if companies fail to follow
rules that include a requirement that they disclose breaches
within 72 hours of discovery. That is a tight window that
security experts say does not give investigators adequate time
to determine the impact of the breach.
    Facebook's latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017,
but the company first identified it on Tuesday of last week.

468,1038,cd61d33b6bb2bf4999d385258db9234c,"Albanian central bank keeps rates on hold, sees no change before April",2018-10-04 2:38:50,EUR,0.44716,2018-10-04 2:38:59,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    By Benet Koleka
    TIRANA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Albania's central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate at the historic low of 1 percent on
Wednesday and signalled there would be no change before next
April.
    Speaking after the bank's board meeting, Governor Gent Sejko
said they had also kept unchanged the rates on one-day deposit
and lending rates respectively at 0.1 and 1.9 percent.
    ""The supervisory board believes... the normalisation of
interest rates in the internal financial market will not start
before the second trimester of 2019,"" Sejko told reporters.
    The bank has steadily cut the benchmark rate since 2008,
from 6.25 percent to the current level of 1 percent, to spur
lending and growth as it seeks to hit its annual inflation
target of 3 percent.
    Albania's economy grew by 4.3 percent in the first half of
2018 and a similar trend was observed in the third quarter,
Sejko said.
    Growth came from private spending and investment, exports
and electricity production in the first quarter, helped by an
improving international economic environment.
    Sejko said monetary stimulus would be needed to guarantee
stable growth in the medium term, adding that the intensity of
the stimulus would diminish in line with the growth performance 
and the speed with which inflation returns to target.
    He said the bank saw inflation, which was slightly higher on
an annual basis at 2.3 and 2.2 percent in July and August
respectively, hitting the 3 percent annual target in 2020.
    ""This dynamic (of inflation) will be backed by the continued
expansion of aggregate demand, leading to higher employment,
wages and profit margins,"" Sejko said.
    Sejko said the board thought that demand and supply for hard
currency, mostly euros, were stable and the appreciation of the
lek to the euro represented ""a lower threat to inflation"". 
    The euro fell to its lowest level to the lek in 10 years in
June before the bank intervened to buy euros. At the end of the
tourism season, Sejko said the demand and supply ratio for hard
currency was ""balanced"" although the bank had not intervened.

towards harmonising corporate tax rates and ensuring foreign
internet giants pay more tax will further fuel populism in the
European Union, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in
a German newspaper interview.
    In an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Le Maire
urged Germany to support France's efforts to introduce a
Europe-wide digital tax.
    He repeated his call, unpopular in German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's conservative bloc, for a central euro zone budget,
warning that the EU single currency would not survive without
one in the long term.
    His comments, made to the paper after a meeting of euro zone
finance ministers in Luxembourg and published on Wednesday
evening, come as Berlin's unwieldy government coalition
struggles to revive its policy agenda after weeks of rowing over
everything from the retrofitting of dirty diesel cars to
migration and the threat of right-wing extremism.
    ""The domestic political situation cannot become an excuse to
delay urgent European policy decisions,"" he was quoted as
saying. ""Not taking decisions now feeds populism. It is better
to act fast and fine-tune later.""
    European citizens ""will not understand if digital companies
like Google or Amazon or Chinese internet companies pay less
than all other companies,"" he said, urging Germany to cast aside
its caution in dealing with the U.S. and its internet giants.
    ""Who are we afraid of? The U.S.?"" he asked. ""It should be
clear by now that Donald Trump only respects those who show
strength and resolution,"" he said, adding that the size of the
EU market gives Brussels leverage over Amazon and Facebook.
    Calls for a euro zone budget have been greeted with great
scepticism in traditionally parsimonious Germany, but Le Maire
said possible future economic crises would endanger the single
currency without one.
    ""There will be a euro zone budget or else there will one day
no longer be a euro zone,"" he said.
    He added that France's budget deficit, which came in below
the EU's ceiling of 3 percent of economic output in 2017 for the
first time in a decade, would come in below the target in 2018
and 2019 as well.

    DUBLIN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Facebook's <FB.O> lead regulator
in the European Union, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner
(DPC), on Wednesday began an investigation into a massive
cyberattack on the social networking site disclosed by the
company last week.
    Facebook said on Friday that hackers had stolen login codes
that allowed them to access nearly 50 million Facebook accounts,
its worst-ever security breach given the unprecedented level of
potential access. [nL4N1WE5P5]
    ""In particular, the investigation will examine Facebook's
compliance with its obligation under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) to implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure the security and safeguarding
of the personal data it processes,"" the DPC said in a statement.
    Facebook spokeswoman Katy Dormer declined comment on the
agency's review. 
    Under the new GDPR European privacy regulations, which came
into effect in May, breaking privacy laws can result in fines of
up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever
is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros
previously.
    The DPC, which regulates a number of U.S. multinationals
with European headquarters in Dublin, said Facebook informed it
that their own internal investigation is ongoing and that the
company continued to take remedial actions to mitigate the
potential risk to users.
    Facebook said on Tuesday that investigators had determined
that the hackers did not access other sites that use the social
networking site's single sign-on. [nL8N1R23NV]
    The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday advised
Facebook users to consider changing their passwords and be on
the alert for ""imposter scams"" targeting them with data stolen
from the social networking site.
    ""If someone calls you out of the blue asking for money or
personal information, hang up,"" FTC attorney Lisa Weintraub
Schifferle said in an alert posted on the agency's website.
    Some security experts, including a former Facebook
executive, said the company may have painted a worst-case
scenario when it disclosed the attack on Friday to ensure
compliance with the strict new European Union privacy rules.
    GDPR imposes steep penalties if companies fail to follow
rules that include a requirement that they disclose breaches
within 72 hours of discovery. That is a tight window that
security experts say does not give investigators adequate time
to determine the impact of the breach.
    Facebook's latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017,
but the company first identified it on Tuesday of last week.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO OPEN MIXED (0522 GMT)
    European shares are expected to open mixed today after gains in the previous session on
relief after the Italian government signalled it would lower its budget deficit from 2020. 
    The mixed open would come as the dollar hit an 11-month high on the yen after strong U.S.
economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011. [nL4N1WK09E]

 Euro/Serbian dinar

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The Czech crown could lead a
firming of Central Europe's most liquid currencies in the coming
year, driven by likely further interest rate hikes by the Czech
central bank, a Reuters poll of 42 analysts showed.
    The median forecast in the Sept. 28-Oct. 3 poll showed that
the crown could firm 2.9 percent against the euro to 25.05 in
the next 12 months relative to its mid-Wednesday level.
    The forint <EURHUF=> and the zloty <EURPLN=> are seen
gaining about 1 percent each to 320 and 4.24 per euro,
respectively.
    The crown <EURRON=> suffered less than its regional peers in
the past six months when a global rally in the dollar <.DXY>
caused selling in other emerging markets.
    In recent weeks, when pressure on the forint and the zloty
eased, the crown underperformed, even though the central bank
raised interest rates at each of its last three rate meetings.
    On Tuesday it hit a 2-1/2-month low at 25.875 against the
euro as worries over Italy's budget deficit and debt sent
jitters across European markets.
    The concerns eased by Wednesday.
    But the crown's weakness relative to the central bank's 25.3
projection for the fourth quarter could make the bank bring
forward its expected further hikes in its 1.5 percent main rate,
Citi analyst Jaromir Sindel said in a note.
    Pressure on markets in European peripheries make a 2 percent
crown firming in the rest of 2018 unlikely, he said.
    ""The CNB (central bank) may continue to 'compensate' for
EURCZK underperformance via a more aggressive front loading of
policy rate hikes, in an attempt to get to its 3.0-3.25 percent
benchmark of Czech neutral policy rate,"" he added.
    Central Europe's economic fundamentals and the region's
previously rapid but now slowing economic growth have been
resilient despite a deterioration in some major emerging
economies this year, noted Regis Chatellier, global sovereign
credit analyst at Societe Generale.
    Hungary's forint <EURHUF=> is supported by robust economic
growth of around 4 percent and a sizeable though shrinking
current account surplus, analysts said.
    The forint can still not appreciate as Hungary's real
interest rates are among the lowest in the universe of emerging
economies, while a robust rise in wages across Central Europe
has increased the country's inflation risks, analysts said.
    The Hungarian central bank's main rate is the lowest in the
region at 0.9 percent, compared with 1.5 percent in the Czech
Republic and Poland, and 2.5 percent in Romania.
    The poll sees the forint trading near 325 versus the euro in
the next six months, weaker from Wednesday's six-week highs at
322.2.
    But it could firm by the time the European Central Bank
starts to increase its interest rates, probably about a year
from now, analysts said.
    ""If the ECB starts to increase rates, the NBH (Hungarian
central bank) will also need to react and that could strengthen
the forint,"" said Noemi Holecz, analyst of Equilor brokerage in
Budapest. 
    Poland's central bank, which kept interest rates on hold on
Wednesday, may start to tighten interest rates even later than
Hungary, analysts said.
    But the zloty is still seen firming even slightly more than
the forint as Poland's inflation, which ran at 1.8 percent in
September, is well below Hungary's levels above 3 percent.
    The leu <EURRON=> is expected to weaken even though the
Romanian central bank increased interest rates three times this
year to fight inflation which exceeds 5 percent.
    On Wednesday the bank held fire and its Governor Mugur
Isarescu reiterated that inflation could fall to the top of the
bank's 1.5-3.5 percent target range - which is identical with
Poland's goal - by the end of the year. [nS8N1T9003]

restrictions on cash withdrawals from domestic bank accounts and
a further easing of capital controls are credit positive for its
banks, ratings agency Moody's said on Thursday.
    The ending of the withdrawal restrictions and an increase in
the amount of money that can be transferred abroad - part of
measures to ease controls imposed three years ago - went into
effect on Oct. 1. [nL8N1WD4MJ]
    Capital controls were put in place in June 2015 amid
political and economic turmoil to stem deposit outflows from
Greek banks. 
    ""Improving economic prospects and an increase in
private-sector deposits allowed for the easing of capital
controls, which will likely strengthen depositors' confidence
and help banks further improve their funding profiles, a credit
positive,"" Moody's said in a report.
    The gradual return of deposits to the banking system over
the past seven months and optimism after Greece's successful
exit from its third bailout programme were the key drivers
behind the decision to loosen capital controls, the agency said.
    In addition, a material reduction in banks’ dependence on
central bank funding through the Bank of Greece’s Emergency
Liquidity Assistance (ELA) mechanism points to a liquidity
improvement in recent quarters.
    ""The easing of restrictions will likely encourage households
and companies to return to local banks any money held outside of
Greece's banking system,"" Moody's said.
    Banks' Emergency Liquidity Assistance balance fell to about
4.5 billion euros ($5.16 billion), or 2 percent of total assets,
at the end of August from 21 percent in August 2015.
    Three of six rated Greek banks - Piraeus <BOPr.AT>, National
Bank <NBGr.AT> and PanCretan Cooperative Bank - have fully
repaid their ELA balances.
    But domestic politics and social instability remained risks
to the economic recovery. ""A potential prolonged political
uncertainty, combined with looser capital controls, could cause
significant deposit outflows,"" Moody's said.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Britain issued statements
overnight accusing Russian military intelligence of directing a
host of cyber attacks aimed at undermining Western democracies
by sowing confusion in everything from sport to transport and
the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has yet to respond
but has in the past repeatedly denied such accusations. The
Dutch Ministry of Defense and UK officials are scheduled to hold
a news conference in the Hague this morning that's also expected
to be about Russian intelligence activities. In the wake of the
Skripal poisoning, Britain has been active in trying to persuade
other European capitals to back further sanctions on Moscow.
    Irish PM Leo Varadkar heads to Brussels as the decisive
period for Brexit negotiations begins. The core of the
discussion today will be about the European Union stance in
resolving the disagreement with the UK on managing the Irish
border after Brexit: the aim is still to get much of the deal
worked out by the EU summit later this month. The FT reports
that Dublin would back any push by Theresa May to keep all the
UK in a temporary customs union with the EU until a permanent
arrangement was worked out - something Brussels has until now
balked at.
    France's Emmanuel Macron visits Charles de Gaulle's grave
today on the 60th anniversary of the French constitution, which
de Gaulle introduced in 1958 with sweeping powers for the office
of president. Macron will no doubt pay homage to his predecessor
and to the stabilising effects which the constitution had on
France, at the time seriously buffeted by the aftermath of the
Algerian conflict. The added piquancy of the event is that
Macron is still aiming to revamp the charter to cut the number
of lawmakers by a third and introduce an unaccustomed dose of
proportional representation. 
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
Growing evidence the U.S. economy is picking up steam just as
the rest of the world cools has catapulted 10-year U.S. Treasury
yields to their highest in seven years and the dollar to its
strongest in six weeks, unnerving global markets fearful of the
rising cost of dollar funding around the world. Outsize gains in
U.S. September business confidence and private-sector payrolls
saw markets rush on Wednesday to fully price in the four more
U.S. interest rate rises that the Federal Reserve has been
signalling, and which Fed chief Jerome Powell reinforced this
week by describing the U.S. economy as ""remarkably positive"".
Ten-year Treasury yields climbed more than 10 basis points on
Wednesday to their highest since 2011, the biggest one-day gain
since just after the U.S. election in November 2016. They 
extended that climb overnight to as high as 3.23 percent and 
the 2-10-year U.S. yield curve steepened above 30 basis points
for the first time since July. The dollar’s rise was broad-
based, with dollar/yen rising to the year’s highs and
euro/dollar falling below $1.15 for the first time since
mid-August. 
    With Brent crude oil prices rising above $86 per barrel,
many emerging markets heavily dependent on dollar borrowing and
energy imports are feeling the heat. Hong Kong, Seoul and
Jakarta benchmark indices all fell more than 1 percent overnight
with Japan’s Nikkei in the red too. India’s rupee hit another
record low and Indonesia’s rupiah fell to its weakest in 20
years. MSCI’s emerging-market equity index suffered its biggest
fall in four months. 
    Buoyed by both the upbeat economic news and the approach of
a third-quarter U.S. earnings season next week that’s likely to
clock annul profit growth in excess of 20 percent, the S&P500
came within a sliver of record highs late Wednesday – even
though the bond market disturbance has seen futures drop 0.5
percent today. European stock futures are marked down by a
similar amount as European government bond yields rose in tandem
with Treasuries.

505,1129,f1fbe237b9b221ca14a8b4da9ac27db9,"World Bank raises growth forecasts for Western Balkans, urges investments",2018-10-04 16:00:01,EUR,-0.17611,2018-10-04 16:00:13,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    BELGRADE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The World Bank revised higher
its 2018 economic growth forecast for the Western Balkans to 3.5
percent, up from a previous 3.2 percent, but said more
investments and exports were needed for  faster and more
sustainable expansion.
    In a report published on Thursday, the bank said the region,
which comprises Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro
and Serbia, would also grow by 3.5 percent in 2019 and by 3.8
percent in 2020.
    The lender said tax reforms and faster growth had led to
higher revenues which some countries used for spending and
capital investments.
    ""But such effects are temporary and costly to sustain: in
the longer term they heighten fiscal vulnerability,"" it said.
    Before the 2008 global financial crisis, the Balkan states
had average growth of 5 to 7 percent a year. Most have since
sought to dispose of state-run firms and reduce their public
sectors to cut deficits and debt.
    The 2018 growth forecasts have also been revised higher for
most of the individual countries in the region, the bank said. 
    Kosovo and Albania are expected to grow by 4 percent, while
Montenegro’s growth is projected at 3.8 percent, down from 4.3
percent last year. 
    Growth in Bosnia would be stable at an estimated 3.2
percent, the report said. Serbia’s economy has rebounded to 3.5
percent growth after last year’s weather-related slowdown. 
    Macedonia’s growth also recovered from stagnation in 2017 to
2.5 percent this year, on restored investors confidence.
    In the report, the World Bank welcomed the creation of more
than 90,000 jobs across the region in the first half of 2018,
but said the labour market response to growth was slow. 
    ""In some countries, inactivity and emigration rather than
new job creation explain the fall in unemployment,"" it said.
    The World Bank urged more investments and exports to help
boost growth. Bosnia, Macedonia, and Serbia have all seen a rise
in their exports, but consumption and large infrastructure
projects have also pushed up imports, the report said.

506,1130,8b421b0b84c8ccb001068ff775dff09a,Need for lengthy ECB guidance will diminish as inflation rises: Rehn,2018-10-04 16:00:01,EUR,1.43986,2018-10-04 16:00:36,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    HELSINKI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The need for the European
Central Bank to give financial markets an extended guidance on
future interest rate moves will diminish once inflation bounces
back enough, ECB policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday.
    The comments suggest that the debate about the ECB's
guidance remains open after board members Benoit Coeure and
Peter Praet both argued recently that the bank may need to
provide an even longer view on the expected path of interest
rates beyond an initial hike. [nL8N1W66BW]
    The ECB now guides markets for steady rates ""through"" the
summer of 2019, suggesting a move sometime in the final quarter
of the year.
    ""The need for extended forward guidance on monetary policy
will also diminish, once inflation has reached sufficient
progress towards the price stability objective,"" Rehn, also the
Governor of Finland's central bank, said in a statement.
    ""As it stands, financial market expectations concerning the
timing of the first interest rate rise are consistent with the
Governing Council's statements,"" Rehn added.
    The ECB targets inflation at just below 2 percent and does
not expect to hit this level before the end of the decade as the
currency bloc is still struggling to absorb economic slack.
    Steering market expectations has been a key challenge for
central banks across the world since the start of the financial
crisis in 2008 as policymakers battled a lending freeze and
fears of an unprecedented depression.
    The ECB expects rates to rise only very slowly and a
longer-term guidance could stop investors from pricing in more
aggressive moves and keep borrowing conditions low for longer.
    After years of aggressive stimulus, the ECB has been
preparing investors for the end of its 2.6 trillion-euro ($3.00
trillion) bond-buying programme in December and for the first
interest rate increase since 2011 sometime after the summer of
next year.

Varadkar arrives in Brussels to meet European Union officials on
Thursday as Brexit talks enter a frenzied fortnight designed to
produce a divorce deal with Britain and a blueprint for future
ties. 
    The Brexit countdown begins with Varadkar meeting EU
leaders' chairman Donald Tusk and the bloc's Brexit negotiator
Michel Barnier later on Thursday. 
    Barnier will on Friday meet politicians from Northern
Ireland where the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on which
British Prime Minister Theresa May relies to govern, is key to
sealing any agreement to end Britain's four decades in the bloc.
    ""It will be long hours and it may get messy but there will
be a deal. The cost of no-deal is just too big,"" said a senior
EU diplomat of the talks, aimed at agreeing a fix to the Irish
border in time for an Oct.17-18 EU summit and then the outline
of post-Brexit ties by another one on Nov.17-18. 
    Both sides are readying concessions and will exchange papers
on the main potential deal-breaker - avoiding extensive border
checks between EU-state Ireland and Britain's province of
Northern Ireland after Brexit - as well as future ties. 
    If they fail to agree, Britain is bound to leave the bloc
next March with little or no agreements in place to mitigate the
economic shock and broad disruptions expected from air traffic
to car production to food trade. 
    Should the leaders of the 27 EU states remaining in the bloc
have no Brexit deal to sign off in November, they are due to
move into contingency mode, stepping up preparations for a
disorderly British departure. 
    Some diplomats and officials say talks could drag on through
December, or even January, but any deal must also be ratified by
both British and EU parliaments in time for Brexit day on March
29, 2019.

is not to support the Italian bond market after its recent
sell-off but to set policy for the whole of the euro zone,
Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said on Thursday. 
    ""The council primarily looks at the development of the whole
euro zone, and firstly from the mid-term price stability target
point of view,"" Rehn said at a conference. ""Monetary policy will
be done based on that, not looking at just one member state but
the whole euro zone.""
    He added that the recent sell-off has not had any
significant impact on other members of the currency bloc,
playing down fears that Italy's troubles could spread to others,
like Portugal, Spain or Greece.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Companies are
rushing to list while stock-market valuations are rich and
before Britain crashes out of the EU. The deluge means bankers
have to price offerings modestly, and investors can afford to be
picky. Hairier issuers, like Aston Martin or Funding Circle,
face a bumpy ride.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Car-leasing company LeasePlan on Oct. 4 announced its
intention to list on the Euronext stock exchange. The Dutch
company was purchased in 2015 for 3.7 billion euros by a
consortium led by pension fund manager PGGM, Denmark's TDR
Capital, sovereign wealth fund GIC, the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority and Goldman Sachs. It is seeking a valuation of up to
7.5 billion euros, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 3. 
    - French solar group Neoen on Oct. 4 said it would raise
about 640 million euros in an initial public offering.
    - Shares in luxury-car maker Aston Martin Lagonda fell as
much as 8 percent on their market debut in London on Oct. 3. The
company, which last year made its first profit since 2010 and
has gone bankrupt seven times, priced its shares at 19 pounds
each, giving it a market capitalisation of 4.33 billion pounds
($5.63 billion). 
    - Aston Martin shares were trading at 17.96 pounds as of
0933 GMT on Oct. 4. 
    - Funding Circle, a UK peer-to-peer lender which listed at
4.40 pounds in London on Sept. 28, was trading at 102 pence at
0933 GMT on Oct. 4.

    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Italy's populist government on
Thursday dismissed concerns that the European Commission will
reject its plan to hike deficit spending next year and signalled
that it would not backtrack, even under market pressure.
    After a selloff hit Italian bonds on Tuesday, the government
made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League late on Wednesday watered down its original
plan to keep its deficit steady at 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2020-21. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But it stuck to its 2.4 percent target for next year, and on
Thursday morning government officials said they had no plans to
make further revisions to that goal, which is three times more
than one set out by the previous government.
    Speaking about the multi-year budget targets that must be
reviewed by Brussels by mid-month, Deputy Economy Minister
Massimo Garavaglia said on Thursday: ""(Either) it passes or it
doesn't, but this isn't the problem. We're more focused on what
is happening in the markets.""
    Garavaglia also said the government's GDP growth forecast
for next year, which has yet to be published, would be 1.6
percent, much higher than the 1.2 percent median projection of
51 analysts polled by Reuters last month.
    The gap between Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields and
their safer German equivalent on Tuesday widened to more than
300 basis points, its widest since May, on concerns about
Italy's plans. On Thursday, the spread was at 278 basis points.
    League leader Matteo Salvini, speaking on RAI state radio,
said that next year's deficit spending was needed to spark
growth and create jobs, and added that the government would not
back down even if the spread widened to 400 basis points.
    ""This is a budget that looks to the future, and we will
absolutely not go backwards,"" Salvini said.
    The government's confident tone came as la Repubblica
newspaper reported that the commission had already sent Italian
officials an informal note saying it would reject next year's
spending plans.
    Sources close to economic commissioners in Brussels said the
report was ""unfounded"". The commission must formally give its
opinion on the budget forecasts by the end of the month.
    Separately, deputy prime minister and 5-Star leader Luigi Di
Maio denied an article in Il Fatto Quotidiano saying the
government was seeking a cabinet reshuffle, mainly to replace
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria in December or January.
    Di Maio also seemed unfazed by concern expressed earlier
this week by commissioners and EU allies over the deficit
spending plans.
    ""We have brought home the people's budget, and we're going
to forge ahead more determined than before,"" Di Maio said in an
interview with Radio Radicale. ""Now we can start a serious and
healthy discussion with the European Commission to reach a
positive conclusion.""

[nL8N1WB2TD]

 (Adds details)
    DUBLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ireland's central bank has seen a
surge in financial services firms seeking to set up or extend
their operations in Ireland as a result of Brexit and is
processing over 100 applications, its governor Philip Lane said
on Thursday.
    Ireland last year said it had received over 100 enquiries
from London-based companies examining moves, but the central
bank's update suggested firms are triggering plans on how to
serve their customers once Britain leaves the European Union.
    ""The potential activities range from banks, investment
firms, trading venues, electronic money institutions, commercial
insurance and retail insurance,"" Lane told a parliamentary
committee.
    Although Lane reiterated that Brexit will be negative for
Ireland's economy and financial system, the growth of its
international financial centre as a result of neighbouring
Britain leaving the bloc is seen as one of the opportunities.
    Barclays, Legal & General Investment Management and Standard
Life Aberdeen are among the companies who have chosen Dublin as
a post-Brexit base against stiff competition from rival centres
including Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris.
    The Irish Central Bank's Director of Asset Management
Supervision Michael Hodson said last week that the bank had seen
a sizeable number of fund management companies seeking to
relocate to Ireland.
    He also warned that firms who had not yet lodged their
applications would face a challenge to get authorised by March
2019, when Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - New British proposals for
avoiding extensive border checks on the island of Ireland after
Brexit are ""a step in the right direction"" and ""make finding a
compromise possible"", a European Union source close to the
negotiations told Reuters on Thursday.
    Brexit talks are entering a frenzied fortnight designed to
produce an EU divorce deal with Britain and a blueprint for
future ties. 
    Avoiding erecting an elaborate border between EU-state
Ireland and Britain's province of Northern Ireland after Brexit
is the main potential deal-breaker.
    Britain wants to regulate the border through a broad
agreement on post-Brexit trade ties with the EU.
    The bloc says an emergency fix - or ""backstop"" - is needed
in case these broader trade talks fail or take longer after
Britain leaves the EU next March and the status-quo transition
period runs its course at the end of 2020. 
    Both sides are readying concessions on the Irish backstop. 
    EU diplomats and officials described the emerging new
British proposal under which Britain would agree to an
indefinite backstop solution - something that was missing in
London's previous proposal rejected by the remaining 27 EU
states last June. 
    But Britain would stick to its line that, in case a backstop
is triggered, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a
customs union together with the EU. That would mean having the
same external tariff on some goods, as the EU currently has with
Turkey. 
    Under the British proposal described by EU sources, that
would remove the need for customs checks on goods and
agriculture on the island of Ireland. 
    For the other type of checks, the regulatory ones, Britain
would agree to simplified, light controls that would be carried
out away from the actual border as much as possible, according
to EU sources describing the emerging proposal. 
    ""This is a step in the right direction, it makes finding a
compromise possible,"" one EU source close to the negotiations
told Reuters on Thursday. 
    Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar arrives in Brussels to
meet European Union officials later on Thursday.

Dublin was not aware that Britain had tabled its planned formal
new ""backstop"" proposal. [nS8N1QW034]
    EU diplomats and officials have also said they have not seen

    BORDER NUANCES
    EU diplomats and officials described the emerging new
proposal under which Britain would agree to an indefinite
backstop solution, something missing in London's previous
proposal rejected by the remaining 27 EU states last June. 
    But Britain would stick to its line that, in case a backstop
is triggered, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a
customs union together with the EU. That would mean having the
same external tariff on some goods, as the EU currently has with
Turkey. 
    Under the British proposal described by EU sources, that
would remove the need for customs checks on goods and
agriculture on the island of Ireland. 
    The EU has previously had an issue with that as it fears
Britain could use the special access of Northern Ireland to the
bloc's single market to push goods that would not have to
conform with high EU norms and could hence be sold cheaper.
    For the other type of checks, the regulatory ones, Britain
would agree to simplified, light controls on goods going from
the British mainland to Northern Ireland that would be carried
out away from the actual border as much as possible, according
to EU sources describing the emerging proposal. 
    That, in turn, is a difficult one for Britain where Prime
Minister Theresa May's government relies on the support of the
Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which vehemently
opposes differing rules on its soil from the rest of the United
Kingdom.
    ""This is a step in the right direction, it makes finding a
compromise possible,"" one EU source close to the negotiations
told Reuters. 
    Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar arrives in Brussels to
meet European Union officials later on Thursday.

    By Anthony Deutsch and Stephanie van den Berg
    THE HAGUE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Dutch authorities disrupted an
attempt in April by Russian intelligence agents to hack the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Defence
Minister Ank Bijleveld said on Thursday.
    At a news conference in The Hague, Bijleveld called on
Russia to cease its cyber activities aimed at ""undermining""
Western democracies.
    She noted that the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to
issue indictments of suspected Russian spies later on Thursday,
in part due to information gleaned from the Dutch operation.
    According to a presentation by the head of the Netherlands'
military intelligence agency, four Russians arrived in the
Netherlands on April 10 and were caught on the 13th with spying
equipment at a hotel next to the OPCW headquarters.
    The men were not successful in breaching OPCW systems, the
minister said.
    At a presentation, Dutch Major General Onno Eichelsheim
showed the antennae, laptops and other equipment the men
intended to use to breach the OPCW's wifi network. He said the
spies were caught red-handed and attempted to destroy some of
their own equipment to conceal what they had been doing.
    At the time, the OPCW was working to verify the identity of
the substance used in the March attack in Salisbury, Britain, on
former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. It was
also seeking to verify the identity of a substance used in an
attack in Douma, Syria.
    The four Russians in the Netherlands were detained in April
and expelled to Russia and not immediately prosecuted because
the operation was considered military, not police, Eichelsheim
said. 
    The men, who were also believed to have spied on the
investigation into the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight
MH17 had planned to travel on from the Netherlands to a
laboratory in Spiez, Switzerland used by the OPCW to analyse
chemical weapons samples, he said.
    They were instead ""put on a flight to Moscow,"" said
Bijleveld.
    Eichelsheim warned against being naive and considering the
Netherlands as relatively safe from Russian cyber attacks.
    Russian military intelligence ""is active here in the
Netherlands ... where a lot of international organisations are
(based),"" Eichelsheim said.

550,1216,4eb135cdf2fa950f3edd518b17f68ff5,Fitch Rates Vodafone's Hybrid Securities 'BBB-',2018-10-04 19:37:02,EUR,0,2018-10-04 19:38:36,"{'EUR': 'Positive', 'GBP': 'Neutral', 'AUD': 'Positive'}","
(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 04: Fitch Ratings has assigned Vodafone Group 
Plc.'s (VOD) (BBB+/Stable) EUR2 billion, EUR0.5 billion, USD1.3 billion and 
GBP0.5 billion subordinated hybrid securities a rating of 'BBB-'.

The hybrid securities are deeply subordinated and to rank senior only to VOD's 
ordinary share capital and pari passu with VOD's mandatory convertible bonds due 
2019. Coupon payments can be deferred at the discretion of VOD. The 'BBB-' 
rating is therefore two notches below VOD's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating 
(IDR), which reflects the securities' increased loss severity and heightened 
risk of non-performance relative to senior obligations. This approach is in 
accordance with Fitch's criteria, ""Non-Financial Corporates Hybrids Treatment 
and Notching Criteria"" dated 27 March 2018 at www.fitchratings.com. 

The securities qualify for 50% equity credit as they meet Fitch's criteria with 
regard to subordination, effective maturity of at least five years, full 
discretion to defer coupons for at least five years and limited events of 
default, as well as the absence of material covenants and look-back provisions. 

VOD has a call option to redeem the notes on any date from the first call date 
to the first reset date (which will be over five years after the issue date) and 
at any interest payment date thereafter. 

There will be a coupon step-up of 25bp in years 10-12 and an additional step-up 
of 75bp 20 years after the first reset date. The first call date and the coupon 
step-up date are not treated as effective maturity dates under Fitch's criteria 
due to the cumulative amount of the step-ups being lower or equal to 1%. The 
documentation includes non-binding, intention-based replacement language that 
supports our permanence assessment of the hybrid instruments. 

There is no look-back provision in the securities' documentation, which gives 
VOD full discretion to unilaterally defer coupon payments. Deferrals of coupon 
payments are cumulative and compounding and the company will be obliged to make 
a mandatory settlement of deferred interest payments under certain 
circumstances, including a payment of ordinary dividend.

The hybrids will be used to partly finance VOD's announced acquisition of the 
Liberty Global cable businesses in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. The structure of the acquisition values the acquired assets at an 
enterprise value of EUR18.4 billion and includes a cash payment of EUR10.9 
billion. 

The acquisition will take VOD's funds from operations (FFO) net leverage above 
its downgrade threshold of 3.5x; our initial assessment suggests the metric will 
exceed this in year one of the transaction but is likely to come down to 3.5x by 
year three. As such the ratings will have no headroom, and any business 
underperformance between now and transaction close is likely to lead to a 
revision of the Outlook to Negative.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Strategic Asset Germany: The announced transaction includes Unitymedia, along 
with cable operations in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The full 
consolidation of the cable market in Germany is expected to lead to significant 
cost synergies and allow VOD to compete far more strongly in fixed and 
convergent services relative to the incumbent. UM is a strongly performing cable 
business exhibiting solid revenue and cash growth. The business has no overlap 
with VOD's previously acquired Kabel Deutschland cable business, which in 
Fitch's view is the primary motivation for the transaction.

 

Deleveraging Levers, Financial Policy: Fitch believes VOD retains inorganic 
levers to deleveraging - including the ability to finesse distribution policy 
and the potential for non-core asset sales. This flexibility in part helps 
underpin the Stable Outlook. Fitch typically expects threshold leverage to be 
achieved within two years of a transaction closing. Some desire from management 
to pursue these means is also likely to influence the sustainability of a Stable 
Outlook. VOD has revised its target net debt/EBITDA range to 2.5x-3.0x 
(previously 2.0x-2.5x). This implies management may seek to manage leverage to a 
higher threshold. 

Historically Fitch-defined FFO net leverage has tended to be around 0.7x higher 
than VOD's reported net debt/EBITDA metric. If management chooses to keep 
leverage consistently at the high end of its revised policy range our downgrade 
threshold is likely to be exceeded indefinitely. Alternative deleveraging levers 
could help reduce the time to get back within the threshold; an absence of which 
is likely to increase pressure on the Outlook.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

VOD's natural peer group includes the large diversified European incumbent 
telecom operators, Deutsche Telekom AG (DT), Orange S.A. (both BBB+/Stable) and 
Telefonica SA (BBB/Stable), extending to incumbents with more limited scale, 
such as BT Group plc (BBB+/Stable), Royal KPN N.V. (BBB/Stable) and Telecom 
Italia S.p.a (BBB-/Stable). Compared with the large incumbent 'BBB+' rated 
peers, VOD has a well-diversified portfolio of international businesses, with 
strong geographic scope, and similar or better growth potential to DT and 
Orange. 

Subject to the proposed Liberty Global transaction VOD's leverage is stretched 
relative to the peer group. The scale and diversification of this peer cohort 
nonetheless provides deleveraging methods (cash-flow scale, potential for asset 
sales or minority listings) not enjoyed by smaller operators, providing more 
latitude in this group's downgrade threshold (set at 3.5x across the peer 
group). No country ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects 
impact the rating.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer

- VOD revenue is expected to grow at low single-digit rates in all financial 
years to March 2021 with additional revenue of approximately EUR3 billion 
expected from the Liberty Global assets

- EBITDA margins gradually improving to around 32% by 2021

- Capex/sales (excluding spectrum) falling gradually but remaining at 15%-16% 
per annum

- Spectrum payments of EUR2.2 billion in 2020

- Operating cost and capex synergies rising from EUR300 million in the first 
year of the Liberty Global deal to EUR500 million by year three

- EUR1.2 billion of Liberty Global integration costs to be spread over five 
years, with 75% of the costs being incurred in year one to three.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

- FFO adjusted net leverage falling below 2.5x on a sustained basis

- Strong free cash flow generation with high single-digit pre-dividend free cash 
flow on a sustained basis

- Continued stability and improving trends across VOD's main operating 
subsidiaries 

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- FFO adjusted net leverage above 3.5x on a sustained basis, which would lead to 
a downgrade;

- Pressure on free cash flow driven by EBITDA margin erosion, higher capex and 
shareholder distributions, or significant underperformance in the main operating 
subsidiaries

LIQUIDITY

Sound Liquidity: VOD exhibits sound liquidity, including good access to debt 
markets, strong banking relationships and solid pre-distribution free cash flow. 
Fitch-defined cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR10.5 billion at end-March 
2018 with VOD benefiting from a further EUR7 billion of undrawn bank lines.

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments 

- Fitch has excluded lease rentals related to short term assets and LLU lines 
from the 2017 annual lease expense; assessed the geographic mix of leased assets 
and applied lease multiples of 5x (Turkey), 6x (South Africa), 7x (Romania, 
Greece and New Zealand), and the standard 8x (rest of world). Telecom 
connectivity leases attract a 5x multiple.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European Union regulators have
recognised the need to cooperate with their UK counterparts to
avoid disorderly markets if no agreement is reached on the terms
of the UK's departure from the EU, Britain's financial watchdog
said on Thursday.
    Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct
Authority, said he welcomed comments on Wednesday from the EU's
top securities regulator that memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) with British regulators were now in the works.
    The MoUs would be in place before Brexit to ensure that
regulators could continue to exchange information, critical for
spotting and dealing with rulebreakers, and supervise
cross-border activity, said Steven Maijoor, chair of the
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) [nL8N1WJ3C4].
    Maijoor also signalled a need to ensure that clearing of
euro-denominated derivatives by UK-based clearing houses can
continue after next March.
    ""I am very encouraged by what Steven said yesterday. It's a
recognition on both sides that we are working together and we
will put in place what is needed to make this as smooth a
transition as it can be,"" Bailey told a City & Financial
conference.
    Markets are worried that a hard Brexit would disrupt
insurance policies and derivatives contracts worth up to 29
trillion pounds ($37.67 trillion) between customers in the EU
and Britain, the region's biggest financial market.
    The EU has been saying it is up to the private sector to
deal with those issues, but Maijoor's comments on cooperation
signal a shift to a more helpful stance.
    Bailey said preparations for Brexit were entering an
intensive phase to ensure an orderly departure, though firms are
not relying on this.
    Banks, insurers and asset managers are opening hubs in
cities like Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg or Dublin by March to
ensure continued service to EU customers.
    Ireland's central bank said on Thursday it was processing
over 100 Brexit-related applications from London-based companies
examining moves there [nL8N1WK2C4].
    ESMA and French regulators said this week that conditions
for allowing foreign financial firms who get access to the
bloc's market directly from London need tightening ahead of
Brexit  [nL8N1WH2Q5].
    ""I hope we don't end up with a world where this is viewed as
an opportunity to close markets and grab business. It will not
end successfully,"" Bailey said.

Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini said in a
statement that the ""aggressive act demonstrated contempt for the
solemn purpose of the OPCW"". 
    ""We deplore such actions, which undermine international law
and international institutions,"" they said.
    ""The EU will continue to strengthen the resilience of its
institutions and those of its member states, and international
partners and organisations in the digital domain,"" they said.

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Diners at a generous
buffet can afford to be picky. The same goes for investors in
European initial public offerings given the deluge of companies
coming to market. They can thank Britain’s impending exit from
the European Union.
    French solar power company Neoen on Tuesday said it could be
valued at up to 1.5 billion euros in an IPO, the same morning as
Netherlands-based LeasePlan [AAHALP.UL]  announced its intention
to float. That followed initial price ranges announced this week
by Spanish oil group Cepsa <CPF.GQ>  and self-storage group
Shurgard. It’s a treacherous time to raise capital: Britain’s
Aston Martin <AML.L>  and Funding Circle <FCH.L>  recently sold
shares towards the bottom of their ranges, and have since fallen
further. 
    There are good reasons for the torrent. First, stock market
valuations are rosy after nearly a decade of easy central-bank
policy. That may end as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates.
Europe’s STOXX 50 index has been trading at close to 10 times
forward earnings since early 2014, compared with an average over
the last decade of 8.8 times. And since companies’ current
owners can only sell down their stakes slowly after an IPO, it
makes sense to list well before markets turn.
    Second, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit early next year
is spooking bankers. Prime Minister Theresa May has said leaving
the bloc in March 2019 without a tariffs or customs agreement is
preferable to a “bad deal”. Even if that’s just posturing,
hardliners in May’s party could vote down a deal she brings to
parliament, leading to the UK falling out of the bloc, and
possible Europe-wide market collapse. As a result, bankers are
hurrying to get deals done now. 
    In the current deluge, bankers have to price offerings
modestly to get attention. Cepsa’s initial range, for example,
was below initial expectations for the Abu Dhabi-owned group.
Boring companies with easy-to-understand businesses - like brake
maker Knorr-Bremse - will be an easier sell than those with
complex business models like loss-making peer-to-peer lender
Funding Circle and serial bankrupt Aston Martin. 
    It had been a sparse year for IPOs in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, with a 6 percent annual decline in volumes in
the nine months to September. That forced investors to take what
was on offer. With the flood of issues now hitting the market,
they are finally getting the upper hand.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Car-leasing company LeasePlan on Oct. 4 announced its
intention to list on the Euronext stock exchange. The Dutch
company was purchased in 2015 for 3.7 billion euros by a
consortium led by pension fund manager PGGM, Denmark's TDR
Capital, sovereign wealth fund GIC, the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority and Goldman Sachs. It is seeking a valuation of up to
7.5 billion euros, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 3. 
    - French solar group Neoen on Oct. 4 said it would raise
about 640 million euros in an initial public offering.
    - Shares in luxury-car maker Aston Martin Lagonda fell as
much as 8 percent on their market debut in London on Oct. 3. The
company, which last year made its first profit since 2010 and
has gone bankrupt seven times, priced its shares at 19 pounds
each, giving it a market capitalisation of 4.33 billion pounds
($5.63 billion). 
    - Aston Martin shares were trading at 17.96 pounds as of
0933 GMT on Oct. 4. 
    - Funding Circle, a UK peer-to-peer lender which listed at
4.40 pounds in London on Sept. 28, was trading at 102 pence at
0933 GMT on Oct. 4.

    By Elisabeth O'Leary
    EDINBURGH, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Scotland's Court of Session has
asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary
ruling on whether the British parliament can change its mind
about leaving the European Union without the bloc's agreement,
the Scottish court said on Thursday.
    Britain's Conservative government is struggling to reach a
deal with the EU on how it will leave the world's biggest
trading bloc as the March 29 exit date approaches. 
    The petitioners, who represent Scottish voters, successfully
argued to the Scottish court that if parliament is to vote on
the government's eventual Brexit deal, it needs legal certainty
on whether the process can be reversed without permission from
the other 27 EU states.
    The Court of Session has asked the Luxembourg-based ECJ,
which rules on the meaning of EU law, for a preliminary ruling,
the court said in a statement. 
    The Article 50 withdrawal clause in the EU's Lisbon Treaty
can be reversed with the permission of the other 27 EU members.
    But it does not specify whether the exit process can be
unilaterally reversed, although former British diplomat Lord
Kerr who drafted it has said Britain can change its mind at any
stage before the final exit date in 2019.
    Scottish law-makers opposed to Brexit filed a petition to
the Court of Session, Scotland's highest court, last year. 
    They represent electoral areas in Scotland which voted
strongly to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. The
United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave.
    The Scottish National Party, the strongest political party
north of the border, has opposed leaving the bloc.   
    Given the urgency of the Brexit deadline the ECJ hopes to
make a decision on the case before Christmas, sources close to
the case told Reuters. 
    The British government, which has argued that it has no
plans to reverse Brexit and therefore does not need to know,
could in theory have presented an appeal to this stage of the
process, but have not done so.
    ""This ship sailed yesterday - when the reference was sent to
Luxembourg - and the government wasn't on it,"" Jo Maugham, a
lawyer who is funding the Scottish law-makers, said on Twitter
    ""We believe it's now too late."" 
    A British government spokeswoman did not immediately
comment.
    The Scottish petitioners argue that legal certainty about
the process is needed in advance of any British parliamentary
vote on an EU withdrawal deal because no country has ever before
 withdrawn from the European Union.
    Brexit supporters say that after the vote to leave, any
attempt to halt the process would be anti-democratic. But
opponents say the country should have a right to pass final
judgement on any exit deal negotiated, and the Scottish
challenge is one of the most robust legals challenges to it so
far.

plus"" arrangement, Tusk told reporters after meeting the Irish
prime minister, explaining Britain could have not just a free
trade accord like that with Canada but also extremely close
relations in security, foreign policy and other areas.
    ""The EU wants a relationship with the UK that is as close
and special as possible,"" Tusk said. ""From the very beginning,
the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada plus
plus plus deal. Much further-reaching on trade, on internal
security and on foreign policy cooperation.""
    Standing beside Irish premier Leo Varadkar and referring to
arguments from British politicians rejecting EU proposals for
keeping Northern Ireland inside EU economic rules, Tusk said:
    ""Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound
attractive but they do not facilitate agreement. Every actor in
this process has their dignity and confrontation in this field
will not lead to anything good.
    ""No one can expect that because of Brexit, the EU will give
up its fundamental values and key interests."" 
    Referring to sharp exchanges on both sides after EU leaders
met British Prime Minister Theresa May at a summit in Salzburg
two weeks ago, he urged her to work to a final accord by the
next summit in Brussels in two weeks.

    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - With just six months to
go until Britain is due to leave the European Union,
negotiations between the sides to agree a divorce settlement and
a blueprint of new relations after Brexit are in the final
stretch.
    If they fail to agree, Britain could face leaving without a
deal, a national election or even another referendum.
    Below are significant dates in the run-up to Britain's
scheduled departure from the EU in March:
    
    IRISH PM IN BRUSSELS - Oct. 4
    Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar holds talks with EU
officials on Thursday, as Britain and the bloc make a new push
to overcome their differences on the post-Brexit Irish border.
    
    BARNIER MEETS N. IRELAND POLITCIANS & EU 27 ENVOYS - Oct. 5 
    EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier meets Northern Irish
politicians but not Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene
Foster who vehemently opposes having different regulations on
her soil to the rest of the United Kingdom. 
    A meeting with Foster is expected next week. 
    Barnier will also brief Brussels ambassadors of the EU 27
states on progress. 
    
    ""OUTLINE OF NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH UK"" - Oct. 10
    Barnier is due to present to the EU's executive European
Commission a first draft of the bloc's proposal for close trade
ties with Britain after Brexit.
        
    EUROPEAN COUNCIL - Oct. 17-18
    May meets fellow EU leaders and the European Commission to
try to seal deals on the terms of Britain's withdrawal and what
kind of relationship it has in the future.
    EU leaders of the 27 states remaining in the bloc will have
a dinner on Wednesday and then hopefully be joined by May on
Thursday to announce enough progress has been made on the Irish
border issue to merit calling an extra EU summit in November to
finalise the deal, including a blueprint of future trade ties.
    
    SPECIAL BREXIT SUMMIT - weekend of Nov. 17-18
    EU leaders are ready to hold a special summit on the weekend
of Nov. 17-18 to seal a Brexit deal with Britain, if agreement
had been reached.
    Markets are expecting a deal in November, and analysts say
sterling would likely fall if the talks slip further.

    EU COUNCIL - Dec. 13-14
    European Union leaders will gather for an EU Council meeting
on Dec 13-14. If a deal is not struck in November, this summit
could be one of the last chances for a deal if parliaments on
both sides are to ratify an agreement by exit day in March.
    
    UK PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON BREXIT DEAL - Unscheduled
    If May secures a deal, she has to get the British parliament
to approve it. She would need about 320 votes in parliament to
get approval.
    Her Conservatives hold 316 seats in the 650-seat lower
house, and she relies on a Northern Irish party to win
parliamentary votes.
    Labour has indicated it would vote against her deal so
unless she can win over her own lawmakers, she could lose a vote
in parliament.
    Failure could trigger a move against her leadership of the
Conservative Party, or the government's collapse and an early
election.
   
    EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RATIFICATION - Unscheduled 
    The European Parliament must also sign off on any agreement
reached between May and the other 27 EU leaders. If the
legislature starts ratification in November or even December, it
should still be able to complete the elaborate process in time
for Brexit day. 
    It could hold a final vote during a plenary session set for
March 11-14. [nL8N1VP3GX] But legislators' minds will also be on
campaigning ahead of European Parliament elections in May - in
which Britain would no longer take part.
    EU officials have suggested a further delay may still be
possible if negotiators are very close to sealing a deal. But it
would just be a few extra weeks at best, as the current EU
parliament holds its last plenary session on April 15-18, 2019.
That is already beyond the current Brexit date.
        
    NO DEAL STATEMENT
    If there is no deal by Jan. 21, 2019, the British government
must make a statement within five days on what it plans to do,
according to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018. 
    May said this week a 'no-deal' Brexit would be better than
the EU's standing offer. [nL8N1WB58N]
    
    BREXIT - March 29, 2019 at 2300 GMT. 
    Britain will formally leave the EU. Providing an exit deal
is agreed, there will be a transition period during which the
bulk of the bloc's rules and regulations continue to apply while
the British government formulates and implements replacement
policies on issues such as immigration.
    
    TRANSITION PERIOD ENDS - Dec. 31, 2020
    The transition period, designed to ease the impact on
businesses and relieve uncertainty, is due to end. Little has
been agreed so far about the new arrangements between Britain
and the EU on trade, customs and other major issues.

up, that can be in itself damaging even if it ends up to be okay

    BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European Council President
Donald Tusk sharply criticised what he called ""emotional"" and
""insulting"" statements about the EU by British ministers and
urged London on Thursday to accept an offer of very close
post-Brexit ties.
    The European Union was offering Britain a ""Canada plus plus
plus"" arrangement, Tusk told reporters after meeting the Irish
prime minister, explaining Britain could have not just a free
trade accord like that with Canada but also extremely close

    Referring to sharp exchanges on both sides after EU leaders

next summit in Brussels in two weeks. 
    Noting his own experience as a political party leader, the
former Polish prime minister said that now May had concluded her
Conservatives' annual conference on Wednesday it was time to
""get down to business"".
    But as a Pole, he took time during his statement to denounce
comments by Britain's foreign minister Jeremy Hunt earlier in
the week in which he likened the EU negotiating stance on Brexit
to the Soviet Union's refusal to let states secede.
    ""Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as
unwise as it is insulting,"" Tusk said. ""As the president of the
European Council and someone who spent half of my life in the
Soviet bloc, I know what I'm talking about.""
    ""Unacceptable remarks that raise the temperature will
achieve nothing except wasting more time. What needs to be done
is maximum progress by the October European Council.""

European Commission reform on posted workers - those who travel
to other EU countries to work on terms set in their home country
- at the European Union court, the government said in a
statement on Thursday.
    Hungary wants the court to annul a directive announced in
July, which extends to the provision of services the principle
of paying equal wages for the same job in the same place. 
    That reform ""does not serve the protection of posted workers
but in fact ... is a tool for protectionism,"" the government
said. 
    Poland and Hungary have led efforts to block the directive,
initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron. 
    Macron wanted to overhaul a system that allows people to
work in other EU countries on contracts that need only guarantee
the host country's minimum wage and that allow taxes and social
charges to be paid in the home nation.
    Macron said the system created unfair competition in
wealthier nations like France and Germany [nL8N1LA3M2].
    Paris complained that central and eastern Europe gains an
unfair advantage from the ""social dumping"" of cheap labour,
arguing that posting low-paid workers hurts local jobs and
erodes labour protections in higher-wage member states.
    Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the
EU workforce, with many employed in haulage and construction,
the issue has widened a divide between the poorer east and rich
west.
    Hungary said on Thursday that the EU directive violated the
freedom of provision of services set out in the bloc's Treaty.
    It said Poland would also challenge the regulation.
    The Polish government was not immediately reachable for
comment.

<CASP.PA> on Thursday denied for the second time this week a
press report that it had hired a financial advisor to sell its
Brazilian supermarket unit GPA <PCAR4.SA>.
    Newspaper Valor Econômico reported on Thursday that Casino
has hired financial advisory group Rothschild & Co SCA to
explore asset sales for the purpose of debt reduction. 
    The mandate specifically excluded the possibility of selling
French operations but did not rule out divesting GPA, according
to the report. The article also says that at least one Brazilian
investor has been contacted by Rothschild.
    A similar report in O Globo newspaper earlier this week that
Rothschild had been mandated to look at the sale of both
Casino's Brazilian and Colombian operations was also denied by
the company.
    Rothschild did not immediately return an e-mail seeking
comment.
    The French bank was hired in 2016 to help GPA sell its
electronics retailer Via Varejo SA <VVAR3.SA>, sources familiar
with the talks have said, but those efforts have so far been
unsuccessful. In morning trading, shares in Via Varejo were down
5 percent, among the biggest decliners on the Sao Paulo stock
exchange index.

    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Italy is considering reducing tax
benefits for the country's lenders as part of measures to fund
next year's budget, a government source said on Thursday.
    Confirming a report in Il Sole 24 Ore daily, the source said
the government could reduce the amount of interest payments and
writedowns that banks can deduct from their taxable income.
    Italy's anti-establishment government is struggling to
finance a number of expensive electoral promises which it wants
to include in next year's budget.
    If the changes went through, banks would only be able to
deduct 85 percent of interest payments from their tax base and
would have to spread losses stemming from the newly introduced
IFRS9 accounting rule over a period of two to 10 years, Il Sole
reported.
    Giovanni Razzoli, an analyst at broker Equita SIM, said he
expected a muted impact on banks' earnings from the outlined
measures, adding this was already priced in by the market, where
Italian banks trade at a deep discount to the value of their
assets.
    Razzoli estimated a 4 percent hit to earnings and an average
capital erosion of 6 basis points.
    The head of Italian banking association ABI said increasing
the tax pressure on banks risked weakening the economy as
lenders could become less able to support businesses.
    But Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the
populist 5-Star Movement, said it was ""sacrosanct ... to strip
bankers of some of their privileges.""
    ""If a good economic performance hinged on bankers'
privileges, we would be in the Land of Plenty by now given all
the money the sector got from previous governments. Things are
going to change,"" he said in a Facebook post.
    Italy's previous centre-left government passed several
measures to help the banking sector recover after a deep
recession, culminating in the state bailout of the country's
third-largest bank Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> in 2017.
    The 5-Star Movement rode popular anger at a string of bank
failures in recent years that have left thousands of Italian who
held their local lenders' bonds and stocks out of pocket.
    Italian banks are large holders of the country's debt and
have been badly hit by market turmoil over Italian bonds.

    The source also confirmed that the government was
considering scrapping tax incentives introduced by the previous
executive to spur companies' capital levels, known as 'Allowance
for Corporate Equity' or ACE.

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): European Versus US Sports

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10046433

Fitch Ratings-London-October 04: US sports leagues create more uniform 
conditions for teams than European ones do, Fitch Ratings says. They do this 
through the absence of relegation, a more equal distribution of broadcast 
revenues, meaningful league support of teams, fair player acquisition rules and 
stringent salary caps. In our credit assessment this often outweighs the fact 
that European football leagues benefit from stronger media rights agreements, 
both domestically and internationally.

US sport leagues are structurally different from European football leagues and 
more creditor-friendly. Relegation can have a material impact on European 
football clubs, whereas this risk is not present in the US. TV rights 
distribution is more balanced in the US, and wages tend to be capped, which 
provides for more stable financial performance. Relegation in Europe increases 
sports competitiveness, and this prevents the waning of interest that can follow 
the dominance of one team. However, for a club relegation represents a major 
""cliff risk"" as revenues drop significantly.

<iframe 
src=""https://e.infogram.com/be846c6f-6db9-4b36-8750-06ccda403dd4?src=embed"" 
title=""DC-727 1"" width=""700"" height=""516"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" 
style=""border:none;"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe> 

European football clubs are far less financially linked to their leagues than 
their US counterparts. In addition to relegation risks, the financial strength 
of European clubs is diverse, and there is general lack of support from the 
leagues for distressed franchises. We view US leagues' involvement in their 
franchises' operations as a fundamental strength. In the past, leagues have 
stepped in to support distressed franchises in US professional sports.

European football benefits from a wider global audience than the majority of the 
US leagues and this provides greater media revenues. Additionally, the top 
European football clubs benefit from being able to compete in other competitions 
which can provide significant additional revenue for these elite clubs. The 
major US sports tend to be single competitions and reliant upon domestic 
broadcasting rights. However, these factors do not prevail over the structurally 
stronger features of the US sports leagues. 

US leagues allocate new players to the lower-performing teams, whereas European 
clubs have to compete in the open market to secure better players, and this is 
more costly. There are soft wage caps in European leagues but these have proved 
ineffective, whereas US leagues have firm wage cap structures which benefit 
clubs' credit quality.   

The league business model assessment features prominently in the credit rating 
of a sports club. Key metrics are benchmarked to different levels depending on 
the league business model strength. As a result, teams in leagues assessed as 
""Stronger"" will tend to achieve higher ratings for a given Debt Service Cover 
Ratio or leverage. As US leagues tend to be stronger, US clubs' ratings tend to 
be higher on average than European clubs' ratings.

For more information on our approach to assessing clubs and transactions in 
major sports leagues, such as the National Football League, the National 
Basketball Association and the English Premier League, see our report, ""European 
Versus US Sports"", published today and available at www.fitchratings.com or by

    BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - European Union negotiators see
the outline of a compromise on the Irish border issue which is
holding up Brexit talks, EU sources told Reuters on Thursday,
raising hopes that a new British offer could unlock a deal.    
    Prime Minister Theresa May has promised new proposals and
sketchy details seen so far have found a tentative welcome in
Brussels.
    ""This is a step in the right direction,"" said one EU source
close to the negotiations. ""It makes finding a compromise
possible."" 
    A second source said EU negotiator Michel Barnier was
looking at where the bloc could make improvements to what it has
offered London as both sides race to overcome the remaining
obstacles to a Brexit deal before a high-stakes EU summit on
Oct. 17-18.
    ""We are definitely engaging with Britain"" on ways to break
the deadlock over what is known as the ""Irish backstop""
[nL8N1W53FD], said an EU diplomat following the negotiations.
    Barnier himself said Brexit negotiations were in their final
stages and the EU was working ""hand-in-hand"" with the Irish
government.
    ""To agree to any deal, we need to have a legally sound
backstop solution for Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" Barnier
said on Twitter after meeting Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.
    Britain has not yet formally delivered new its ideas,
notably about a fall-back option to maintain the whole of the
United Kingdom in a customs union with the EU.
    The EU is insisting on a ""backstop"" clause in any withdrawal
treaty to avoid erecting border posts between the British
province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland if London and
Brussels cannot agree a trade pact for the future.
    A seamless border is part of the settlement which largely
ended decades of violence in the province. 
    Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he was not
aware that Britain had presented its new backstop proposal. But
word that the EU was willing to engage with the new plan taking
shape in London sent the pound rising against the dollar.
[nS8N1QW034] [nL8N1WK2K1]
    Varadkar met EU summit chair Donald Tusk before meeting
Barnier.
    Tusk urged May to put a round of angry rhetoric behind them
and get down to sealing an agreement that would preserve peace
in Ireland and open the way to a post-Brexit relationship he
called ""Canada plus plus plus"" -- combining free trade deal like
the one agreed with Canada with close security, global affairs,
research and other cooperation.
       
    BORDER NUANCES
    EU diplomats and officials described an emerging new
proposal under which Britain would agree to an indefinite border
backstop solution, a commitment missing in London's previous
proposal rejected by the remaining 27 EU states last June. 
    But Britain would stick to its line that, if the backstop
was triggered, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a
customs union with the EU. That would mean having the same
external tariff on some goods, as the EU currently has with
Turkey, and curb Britain's ability to strike trade deals with
other countries. 
    Under the British proposal described by EU sources, that
would remove the need for customs checks on goods and
agriculture on the island of Ireland. 
    The EU has feared such an arrangement could allow Britain to
use Northern Ireland's special access to the bloc's single
market to push goods that did not conform with high EU norms,
and hence be sold cheaper.
    For separate regulatory checks, Britain would agree to
simplified, light controls on goods going from the British
mainland to Northern Ireland that would be carried out away from
the actual border as much as possible, according to EU sources
describing the emerging proposal. 
    That is difficult for May, whose government relies on the
support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which
vehemently opposes differing rules on its soil from the rest of
the United Kingdom.

raising hopes that a new British offer could unlock a deal.    
    Prime Minister Theresa May has promised new proposals and
sketchy details seen so far have found a tentative welcome in

    ""This is a step in the right direction,"" said one EU source

    Britain has yet to formally deliver its new ideas, Varadkar
said, notably about a fall-back option to keep the whole of the
United Kingdom in a customs union with the EU. 
    Varadkar said Dublin was open in principle to anything that
helps escape extensive Irish border checks but voiced caution on
an all-UK customs union, which the EU has once rejected before. 
    The EU is insisting on a ""backstop"" clause in any withdrawal

""Canada plus plus plus"" -- combining free trade deal like the

    Another senior EU diplomat said the bloc's offer was to have
""zero tariffs and zero quotas"" in UK trade after Brexit. 
       
    TIGHT TIMING
    EU diplomats and officials described an emerging new
proposal under which Britain would agree to an indefinite border
backstop solution, a commitment missing in London's previous
proposal rejected by the remaining 27 EU states last June. 
    But Britain would stick to its line that, if the backstop
was triggered, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a
customs union with the EU. That would mean having the same
external tariff on some goods, as the EU currently has with
Turkey, and curb Britain's ability to strike trade deals with
other countries. 
    Under the British proposal described by EU sources, that
would remove the need for customs checks on goods and
agriculture on the island of Ireland.
    While Varadkar has not ruled that out point-blank, he told a
Brussels news conference: ""There would be constraints. A lot of
countries would take the view that any UK-wide arrangement is
really a matter for future relations rather than a backstop
which is about Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" he said.
    The EU has feared such an arrangement could allow Britain to
use Northern Ireland's special access to the bloc's single
market to push goods that did not conform to high EU norms, and
hence be sold cheaper. 
    For separate regulatory checks, Britain would agree to
simplified, light controls on goods going from the British
mainland to Northern Ireland that would be carried out away from
the actual border as much as possible, according to EU sources
describing the emerging proposal. 
    That is difficult for May, whose government relies on the
support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which
vehemently opposes differing rules on its soil from the rest of
the United Kingdom. Barnier is due to meet the DUP head Arlene
Foster next week.
    EU and Britain are seeking ""decisive progress"" on the Irish
issue in time for a leaders summit due Oct.17-18 and then a
final deal, including a blueprint of future relations, at
another one in mid-November. 
    Should they succeed, Britain would get a status-quo
transition period after Brexit until the end of 2020. Should
they fail, London faces crashing out of the bloc next March with
little to replace four decades of closest cooperation from trade
to security to air traffic.

    * Quarterly growth seen at +0.5 pct in Q3, +0.4 pct in Q4

    PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - French economic growth is set to
pick up in the second half of the year but will struggle to meet
the government's growth target, the INSEE stats agency forecast
on Thursday.
    The euro zone's second-biggest economy is on course for
growth this year of 1.6 percent as a recovery in household
income helps offsets a slowdown in the first half of the year,
INSEE said in its quarterly outlook. 
    The estimate was marginally less optimistic than the 1.7
percent the government was expecting this year and marks a
slowdown from the 2.3 percent recorded last year.
    INSEE had previously forecast 1.7 percent, and it said
growth could still reach that if households ended up spending
rather than saving extra cash from two tax cuts taking effect in
the second half of the year.
    France eked out quarterly growth of only 0.2 percent in the
first two quarters of the year as strikes curbed activity and a
warm spring kept energy spending low.
    INSEE estimated growth would more than double to 0.5 percent
in the third quarter and come in at 0.4 percent in the final
three months. The tax cuts could push it even higher.  
    Cuts in payroll and housing taxes in the second half of 2018
were expected to increase growth in household disposable income
to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter from 0.5 percent in the
third quarter.
    Slower inflation would also help keep more money in
households' pockets. It is forecast to average 1.9 percent over
the whole of the year after peaking at 2.2 percent in the third
quarter.
    INSEE said that unemployment was expected to keep easing
over the course of the year to stand at 8.9 percent at the end
of December.

    By Giuseppe Fonte and Steve Scherer
    ROME, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The Italian government on Thursday
dismissed concerns that the European Commission would reject its
plan to raise deficit spending next year and signalled that it
would not backtrack, even under market pressure.
    After a selloff hit Italian bonds on Tuesday, the government
made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League on Wednesday watered down its original plan to
keep its deficit steady at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2020-21. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But it stuck to its 2.4 percent target for next year, and on
Thursday government officials said they had no plans to make
further revisions to that goal, which is three times more than
one set out by the previous government.
    Speaking about the multi-year budget targets that must be
reviewed by Brussels by mid-month, Deputy Economy Minister
Massimo Garavaglia said on Thursday: ""(Either) it passes or it
doesn't, but this isn't the problem. We're more focused on what
is happening in the markets.""
    Garavaglia also said the government's GDP growth forecast
for next year would be 1.6 percent, much higher than the 1.2
percent median projection of 51 analysts polled by Reuters last
month.
    That goal was later confirmed by Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria in a letter to the European Commission, which called for
""open and constructive dialogue"" over the budget plan.
[nR1N1RB01X]
    Growth was forecast at 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent
in 2021, Tria said.
    The gap between Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields and
their safer German equivalent on Tuesday widened to more than
300 basis points, its widest since May, on concerns about
Italy's plans. On Thursday, the spread had narrowed to 278 basis
points.
    League leader Matteo Salvini, speaking on RAI state radio,
said that next year's deficit spending was needed to spark
growth and create jobs, and added that the government would not
back down even if the spread widened to 400 basis points.
    ""This is a budget that looks to the future, and we will
absolutely not go backwards,"" Salvini said.
    The government's confident tone came as la Repubblica
newspaper reported that the commission had already sent Italian
officials an informal note saying it would reject next year's
spending plans.
    Sources close to economic commissioners in Brussels said the
report was ""unfounded"". The commission must formally give its
opinion on the budget forecasts by the end of the month.
    Separately, deputy prime minister and 5-Star leader Luigi Di
Maio denied an article in Il Fatto Quotidiano saying the
government was seeking a cabinet reshuffle, mainly to replace
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria in December or January.
    Di Maio also seemed unfazed by concern expressed earlier
this week by commissioners and EU allies over the deficit
spending plans.
    ""We have brought home the people's budget, and we're going
to forge ahead more determined than before,"" Di Maio said in an
interview with Radio Radicale. ""Now we can start a serious and
healthy discussion with the European Commission to reach a
positive conclusion.""

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 04: Fitch Ratings has affirmed ALD S.A.'s (ALD) 
Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A-' and 'F1' 
respectively, following completion of its commercial fleet leasing peer review. 
The Rating Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Stable. A full list of rating actions 
is at the end of this release. 

ALD is domiciled in France and listed on Euronext. It is a full service vehicle 
leasing company with leading franchises in a number of European markets, notably 
France and Italy, as well as a number of non-European countries. Following the 
2017 IPO, Societe Generale S.A. (SocGen; A/Stable/F1/a) remained ALD's majority 
shareholder with an 80% stake in the company.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SENIOR DEBT

ALD's Support Rating and IDRs are driven by support from its majority 
shareholder, SocGen. Given ALD's ownership, significant parental funding and 
relevance for SocGen's financial services business division, we believe ALD to 
be of strategic importance for SocGen. Extraordinary capital or liquidity 
support, if ever required, would therefore in our opinion be extremely likely, 
which is reflected in the Support Rating of '1'.

ALD's Long-Term IDR is one notch from SocGen's Long-Term IDR. This primarily 
reflects our assessment of ALD as being strategically important to SocGen due to 
ALD's meaningful revenue contribution (and diversification) to the SocGen group, 
material operations in SocGen's core market of France, close integration in 
SocGen's risk management framework and SocGen's public commitment to remain 
ALD's majority shareholder and principal funding provider. 

However, the notching also takes into account ALD's largely autonomous 
franchise, which in our opinion creates moderate business synergies between ALD 
and SocGen, ALD's size (which means any support from SocGen is in our view 
manageable but would require meaningful SocGen resources) and SocGen's majority 
but not full ownership of ALD.

ALD is integral to SocGen's financial services business unit and a relevant part 
of its domestic and wider European franchise. However, synergies, in particular 
around distribution channels and shared clients, are more limited than for 
instance at SocGen's French consumer finance subsidiaries.

ALD's management is relatively independent from SocGen's management, reflecting 
ALD's non-banking business model. However, funding is currently underpinned by 
SocGen, and risk management is integrated into SocGen.

As of end-1H18, SocGen provided around 75% of ALD's non-equity funding, which 
increases the likelihood of support, in our opinion. Given the amount of funding 
provided by SocGen, a default on non-SocGen debt would be viewed extremely 
negatively by market participants, in our opinion.

ALD's Long-Term IDR of 'A-' maps to two possible Short-Term IDRs (F1 or F2). As 
ALD's IDRs are ultimately underpinned by SocGen's IDRs, we align the Short-Term 
IDR with SocGen's own 'F1' Short-Term IDR.

ALD's senior unsecured EMTN programme ratings are aligned with the company's IDR 
as in Fitch's view the likelihood of default on the senior unsecured notes under 
the programme reflects the likelihood of default of ALD. The ratings of the 
programme apply only to senior unsecured notes issued by ALD. There is no 
assurance that notes issued under the programme will be assigned a rating or 
that the rating assigned to a specific issue under the programme will have the 
same rating as the programme.

The expected rating on the positive impact bond is aligned with ALD's Long-Term 
IDR as Fitch views the likelihood of default on the senior unsecured notes as 
equal to that of ALD and also because of the bonds' average recovery prospects.

ALD's standalone risk profile is underpinned by its well-established, leading 
franchise in European car leasing, well-articulated and soundly executed 
strategy and ordinary support from SocGen in its funding profile. The assessment 
also considers ALD's recent aggressive growth, relatively high balance sheet 
leverage and relatively concentrated funding profile.

ALD has sufficient scale and a degree of pricing power in most markets. Its 
business model is supported by a sizeable number of well-established 
partnerships with car manufacturers, banks (both French and international) and 
U.S.-based fleet lessor Wheels, Inc. (A/Stable).

As primarily an operating lease provider, ALD's main risk is its exposure to 
residual value (RV) risk (including to diesel engines). However, RV risk is 
well-managed, as highlighted by net fleet disposal gains in most market 
environments. RV setting appears prudent and subject to regular stress tests, 
but ALD remains sensitive to negative developments in second-hand car markets. 
Credit risk management benefits from SocGen's risk management framework and 
adequate diversification by clients. Growth, including in private leases, has 
been rapid in recent years and growth plans are relatively ambitious, in our 
view.

ALD's profitability compares well with other operating leasing companies. 
Revenue principally relates to leasing contract and services revenue, both of 
which are primarily driven by fleet growth. Reliance on net gains from selling 
used fleet units is limited (typically accounting for less than 10% of operating 
revenue). Cost discipline is good with a cost/income ratio (excluding the net 
car sales result) of around 50%, comparing well with peers. ALD's pre-tax 
income/average assets ratio, Fitch's core ratio for leasing company 
profitability, remained comfortably above 3% in recent years, providing an 
adequate buffer against volatility in ALD's post-lease net car sales result.

As a largely unregulated holding company, ALD is not subject to any meaningful 
regulatory capital or leverage requirements. ALD's balance sheet capitalisation 
has improved in recent years, and management targets an equity/assets ratio of 
between 15% and 17%. At end-1H18, ALD's gross debt/tangible equity ratio, 
Fitch's core metric for leasing company leverage, stood at around 5.6x, broadly 
in the middle of Fitch's 'bb' range (5x to 7x) for leasing company leverage. 
Given the resilience of ALD's business model and our expectation that leverage 
should not exceed 7x, we view leverage as just acceptable.

ALD's balance sheet is well matched by tenor, interest rate and currency. This 
limits ALD's liquidity requirements. Since 2012 ALD has been diversifying its 
funding profile by accessing European ABS and to a lesser extent third-party 
bank funding, but its funding profile remains less developed, concentrated and 
reliant on SocGen (which also provides guarantees for some of ALD's third-party 
funding).

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SENIOR DEBT

Any change in SocGen's Long-Term IDR would likely be mirrored in ALD's ratings. 
Given our standalone assessment of ALD and current notching, a downgrade of 
SocGen below 'A-' would not automatically lead to a downgrade of ALD but could 
put pressure on ALD's ratings given the importance of SocGen for ALD's 
distribution capabilities and current funding profile.

A material reduction in SocGen's stake in ALD, in particular if in conjunction 
with a diminished strategic importance of ALD for SocGen, could lead to wider 
notching and a downgrade of ALD's Support Rating.

An increasing strategic importance of ALD for SocGen, for instance by increasing 
distribution/product synergies, combined with an unchanged ownership structure, 
could lead to an equalisation of ALD's and SocGen's Long-Term IDRs.

The programme ratings and the expected bond rating are sensitive to changes in 
ALD's Long- and Short-Term IDRs.

Leverage firmly in the 'bbb' range (gross debt/tangible equity of less than 5x) 
would be positive for ALD's standalone assessment, as would a more diversified 
funding profile and more prescriptive liquidity management policies.

A moderation of ALD's fast recent organic and inorganic growth (which has 
generated additional goodwill and has increased the demand placed on the 
company's control environment) would also be positive.

Materially higher leverage, as a result of either incremental debt or a 
reduction in tangible equity due to material additional goodwill, would be 
negative for our standalone assessment.

Any indication that ALD's RV risk management has weakened (for instance 
evidenced by outsized net car sales losses) or a weakening of its depreciation 
policies would also be viewed negatively.

 

Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: 

ALD S.A.

--Long-Term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable;

--Short-Term IDR at 'F1';

--Support Rating at '1';

--Senior unsecured EUR6 billion EMTN long-term programme rating at 'A-';

--Senior unsecured EUR6 billion EMTN short-term programme rating at 'F1' ;

--EUR500 million senior unsecured positive impact bond at 'A-(EXP)'.

conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it

factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or

any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or

Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the

investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to 
any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000

within seven-ten days and the economy cannot withstand any more
delay, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said on Thursday.
     Since a parliamentary election in May, political wrangling
has prevented Lebanon from forming a national unity government,
raising concerns in a country with one of the world's highest
rates of public debt.
    ""The economic situation is very difficult...(it) can't bear
political disputes,"" Hariri said in an interview on a prime-time
television show on Thursday night. ""There are solutions, which
(President Michel Aoun) and I have discussed."" 
    In the five months since the May vote, Hariri has expressed
optimism several times about a near breakthrough. [nL8N1WJ4U1]
    Key parties in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system have
jostled over ministries, as foreign donors urged avoiding any
more delay and Lebanese politicians warned of economic crisis.
    A Paris donors conference in April yielded pledges of
billions, conditional on reform that a new government will have
to undertake. 
    Lebanon's last coalition government continued as a caretaker
administration after the May vote, which produced a parliament
tilted in favour of the Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement.

    * Trade surplus widens again
    * Overall GDP growth seen slowing

 (Adds analyst comment, context)
    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - German exports unexpectedly fell
in August, data showed on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that
manufacturers in Europe's largest economy shifted into a lower
gear over the summer months.
    The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted
exports edged down by 0.1 percent on the month, missing a
Reuters forecast of a 0.3 percent rise. Imports dropped by 2.7
percent, undershooting a predicted 0.2 percent fall.
    ING economist Carsten Brzeski blamed the low trade volumes
over the summer months on a general weakening of global
manufacturing activity and a temporary blip in domestic demand.
    ""The traditional German growth engine is stuttering once
again,"" Brzeski said, in reference to exports. ""Luckily, the
German economy is no longer running on one or two cylinders but
still has solid domestic demand to lean on. At least for now.""
    Household spending has become an important growth driver in
Germany as consumers are reaping the benefits of record
employment levels, rising real wages, increased job security and
cheap credit due to the euro zone's expansive monetary policy.
    The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 18.3
billion euros ($21.0 billion) in August from 15.9 billion in the
previous month, the data showed.
    Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the
flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 15.3 billion
euros from 15.1 billion euros in July, unadjusted data showed.
    The trade figures chimed with data released on Monday that
showed industrial output edging down unexpectedly in August,
suggesting the German economy lost steam in the third quarter.
[nL8N1WO0UI]
    Volker Treier from the DIHK chambers of industry and
commerce said the weak data meant that he would probably have to
cut his forecast for 5 percent export growth this year.
    ""Exports are stagnating. And the worst is probably yet to
come. In particular, the trade conflict between China and the
United States will leave its mark in the coming 12 months,"" he
said. ""German companies are too interconnected in the global
economy, especially with these two countries, to be free from
it.""
    Economists are taking an increasingly pessimistic view of
the German economy, with the top German institutes last month
revising down their 2018 growth forecast and warning that an
escalation of trade friction involving the United States could
cause a major recession in Germany and Europe.
    A source has also told Reuters that the government will
revise down its growth forecasts for this year and next. The
government is expected to announce its updated growth
projections on Thursday. [nL8N1WC46B] [nL8N1WL2TB]
    Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last month the economy
would grow by around 2.0 percent this year, plus or minus 0.1
percent. Last year, Germany's gross domestic product expanded by
a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent, the strongest rate since 2011.

    By Amanda Ferguson
    BELFAST, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The head of the Northern Irish
party that props up Prime Minister Theresa May's government said
on Tuesday a Brexit deal was ""eminently possible"" within weeks,
but she would not accept different regulations from the rest of
the United Kingdom.
    In an interview before a meeting with chief EU Brexit
negotiator Michel Barnier, Foster stuck to her rejection of any
new regulatory or customs barriers between Britain and Northern
Ireland - but said with political will, a deal was possible.
    ""We cannot have the single market of the United Kingdom
interfered with in that way and that is the message we will be
giving to Michel Barnier today. There cannot be any regulatory
barriers between ourselves and the rest of the United Kingdom,""
she said.
    ""I want to see a deal that works for everyone and I think
that is eminently possible if the political will is there to
make it happen,"" Foster told BBC Radio Ulster.
     The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland is the biggest remaining sticking point in Brexit talks
between Britain and the European Union, and both sides are
trying to work out how to monitor and regulate trade over the
frontier.
    EU sources told Reuters on Thursday that EU negotiators see
the outline of a compromise on the Irish border issue, raising
hopes that a new British offer could unlock a deal. [nL8N1WK2J0]

investors will rattle the cages of VW and Daimler depends on how

standard, crummy German governance through partial listings,

expressed are his own.)
    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Activists are
already convoying around the European continent. Volkswagen
<VOWG_p.DE>  and Daimler <DAIGn.DE>  may soon bring them by the
truckload to Germany. Both may be inching towards separating
their truck businesses. That’s good, as investors tend not to
ascribe much value to them inside the sprawling carmakers. It’s
the way they go about setting these operations free that could
bring uppity shareholders to their doorsteps.
    The corporate finance logic is clear. At 13 times forecast
operating profit – the multiple rivals Paccar <PCAR.O> and Volvo
<VOLVb.ST> currently trade at – the VW and Daimler divisions
would be worth 65 billion euros, including debt, using Evercore
estimates. Assuming the parents, who sport a combined market
value of 132 billion euros, keep their current lowly multiples
of around four times operating profit, the two companies would
be worth 43 billion euros more than their parents fetch today,
on Breakingviews calculations.
    They risk squandering that opportunity. VW is planning a
partial listing of its MAN and Scania brands, which would
continue to handcuff them to its governance-challenged parent.
With Wolfsburg still calling the shots and meddling in its
affairs, the listed company would still effectively be part of
the VW conglomerate, and hardly deserve a premium valuation. For
Daimler, following the path of its rival would doom that
business to a similar fate.
    The better option is to give them independence by spinning
them off directly to shareholders. Fiat Chrysler <FCHA.MI>  did
this with Ferrari <RACE.MI>, first launching an initial public
offering of 10 percent, and then handing the remainder over to
investors. The sports car firm’s stock nearly tripled since.
While a similar transaction would still lard VW’s truck unit
with uber-traditionalist owners like the state of Lower Saxony,
at least it would have its own currency and a freer hand in
charting its future.
    German companies, particularly automakers like VW, rarely
take the lead in pursuing the best practices of corporate
governance. It’s not easy when, by law, unions have a big say in
the boardroom. But that’s changing. Thyssenkrupp <TKAG.DE>  just
last month said it will split into two. Of course, it took
pressure from activists Elliott and Cevian Capital to make that
happen. VW and Daimler would be wise to study that case as they
get trucking.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Volkswagen is close to hiring Citigroup, Deutsche Bank,
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to help with the potential stock
market listing of its truck unit Traton, Reuters reported on
Oct. 8 citing two people familiar with the matter.
    - The German car group on Sept. 17 said its truck unit
should be in shape for a potential stock market listing by the
end of the year. A float would probably take place in mid-2019,
Reuters reported.
    - The company's supervisory board has decided to convert the
truck group’s legal structure to a Societas Europaea (SE) -
common for European public-limited companies. It expects to
mandate investment banks and legal advisors shortly.
    - Volkswagen is targeting proceeds of more than 6 billion
euros ($7 billion) with a potential listing of its truck and bus
subsidiary, the division's chief executive had said earlier this
year.
    - Daimler’s management and supervisory boards on July 26
approved plans to create three legally independent entities
under the parent group’s umbrella: Mercedes-Benz, Daimler Truck
and Daimler Mobility.

    By Amanda Ferguson and Gabriela Baczynska
    BELFAST/BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A Brexit deal is
""eminently possible"" within weeks but there can be no regulatory
barriers within the United Kingdom, the head of the Northern
Irish party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May
said on Tuesday.
    Less than six months before the UK's exit from the European
Union, there is little clarity about how the world's fifth
largest economy and its preeminent international financial
centre will trade with the EU after Brexit.
    Talks are snagged on how to avoid checks on the border
between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the
sides fail to clinch a post-Brexit free trade deal.
    May and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),
which supports her minority government, have opposed EU
proposals for a backstop that would keep Northern Ireland - but
not mainland Britain - de facto inside the EU economic space.
    Ahead of a meeting with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier
in Brussels, DUP leader Arlene Foster stuck to her rejection of
any new regulatory or customs barriers inside the United Kingdom
- but said that, with political will, a deal was possible.
    ""I want to see a deal that works for everyone and I think
that is eminently possible if the political will is there to
make it happen,"" Foster told BBC Radio Ulster. ""I very much hope
that there is a deal in a number of weeks."" 
    The EU's Brexit negotiators believe a divorce deal with
Britain is ""very close"", diplomatic sources told Reuters last
week, indicating a compromise on the future Irish border was in
play. [nL8N1WL0WQ]
    A flurry of Brexit activity is expected over coming days.
    Barnier will update the Commission on Wednesday and then EU
ambassadors meet on Friday in Luxembourg. EU leaders'
negotiators meet in Brussels on Monday.
    But even if May clinches a deal, there is uncertainty on
whether she could sell it at home, where she will need approval
from the British parliament.
    Lawmaker Steve Baker said at least 40 lawmakers in her
Conservative Party were willing to vote down her possible Brexit
deal if it left the UK 'half in and half out' of the EU.
    
    BLIND BREXIT?
    If lawmakers reject a deal, May could fall and Britain would
face leaving the EU without an agreement, a move investors and
company chiefs say would weaken the West, panic financial
markets and block the arteries of trade.
    The United Kingdom would move from seamless trade with the
EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization
for external states.
    ""Colleagues will not tolerate a half-in, half-out Brexit,""
said Baker, who served as a junior Brexit minister in May's
government until he resigned in protest at her proposals.
    If 40 of her lawmakers voted against a possible deal, the
fate of the government and exit process would depend on the
opposition Labour Party, which has indicated it will vote
against almost any deal May might secure.
    Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term
economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if
cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in
German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare
spending.
    A 'hard' Brexit would result in extra tariffs of more than 3
billion euros ($3.4 billion) for German companies per year, a
German institute said on Tuesday, adding that German exports to
Britain could drop by up to 57 percent. [nL8N1WP1NU]
    Under May's proposals, Britain will seek a free trade area
for goods with the EU, largely by accepting a ""common rulebook""
for goods and British participation in EU agencies that provide
authorisations for goods.
    Some Brexiteers say those proposals would ensure the EU kept
control over swathes of the British economy and thus run counter
to the spirit of her manifesto pledge to leave the EU Customs
Union and the Single Market.

 (Adds fresh quotes, IPCC, detail)
    By Daphne Psaledakis
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union environment
ministers will seek a compromise on Tuesday over how tough to be
on curbing carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans, with
Germany warning too tough targets could harm industry and cost
jobs.
    In a clash between concerns over the environmental risk of
emissions and industry competitiveness, EU governments are
divided over what 2030 limits to impose on Europe's powerful
carmakers.
    Germany, with its big auto sector, has backed the EU
executive proposing a 30 percent reduction by 2030, compared to
2021 levels. [nL8N1WI1K1] [nL8N1WC3PB]
    ""After the IPCC report yesterday that is not easy. But it is
a position we all agreed on,"" German Environment Minister Svenja
Schulze told reporters on her way to the meeting in Luxembourg.
    The meeting comes a day after the release of the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which
warned that societies would have to make ""unprecedented"" changes
to meet a lower global warming target. [nL4N1WO1TL]
    France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are among countries
pushing for a stricter limit of 40 percent, in line with climate
targets backed by EU lawmakers last week. [nL8N1WJ305]
    ""Everyone is calling for action after the report from
climate experts, and we now have a chance to find an agreement
that is the most dynamic possible, the most ambitious possible,""
said French Minister for the Environment, Francois de Rugy.
    
    TOO CLOSE TO CALL
    EU regulators have been galvanised into setting tougher
rules by Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it had
masked exhaust emissions using software in as many as 11 million
diesel vehicles worldwide.[nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    In response to a recent EU study that showed carmakers
cheating new pollution checks, the bloc's lawmakers added an
amendment requiring figures to be verified against on-road
tests. [nL5N1UL2JU] 
    Under the plan, carmakers would be able to lower their CO2
targets by meeting a benchmark for the sale of zero- and
low-emission vehicles as a share of their total new car sales.
[nL8N1WJ305]
    Pushing to reach an agreement among the bloc's 28 nations at
the Luxembourg meeting on Tuesday, Austria, which holds the EU's
rotating presidency, has proposed a compromise of 35 percent
reduction in emissions by 2030.
    ""It's too close to call,"" said Greg Archer, an expert with
Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. 
    If they reach an agreement, negotiations on the final law
could begin with the EU's two other lawmaking bodies as early as
Wednesday.
    EU sources said that more-populated Germany, with the
backing of eastern European nations, may have the votes needed
for a majority at the meeting.
    The limits in the transport sector - the only one in which
emissions are still rising - aim to help the bloc meet its
overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030.

    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union countries are on
the verge of agreeing to start negotiations with the United
States to allow more U.S. beef into Europe, in what could be a
major move to defuse transatlantic trade tensions.
    The European Commission sought approval from its 28 member
states at the start of September to open negotiations with
Washington. 
    Trade experts have already given their backing, ambassadors
will provide clearance on Wednesday and the approval process is
set to be completed next week, EU diplomats say.
    The beef issue is officially separate from a pact reached by
U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission chief
Jean-Claude Juncker in July to try and ease trade tensions.
Trump has pledged to reduce the United States' $151 billion
goods trade deficit with the European Union. 
    However, a deal to increase U.S. meat imports would affect
the trade balance, as well as placating the Trump base of U.S.
farmers and rural communities which have been hit by the
tit-for-tat trade war with China.
    EU diplomats say the European Commission, which negotiates
on behalf of the 28 EU countries, would look to raise the U.S.
share of hormone-free beef imports into Europe, but would need
to convince other countries considered to be ""substantial""
suppliers to accept less.
    A negotiated agreement on beef would settle a dispute that
dates back to 1981 when the European Union banned the use of
growth hormones in meat across the bloc, including imports. 
    The EU and the United States eventually concluded an
agreement in 2009 to grant a quota for hormone-free beef
imports, which currently stands at 45,000 tonnes. However, under
World Trade Organization rules, the quota also had to be made
available to non-U.S. suppliers.
    
    ""LESS OR NOTHING""
    The U.S. share of that quota has slipped from nearly 100
percent at the start to less than 30 percent in the year to the
end of June, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation
(USMEF).
    Australia and Uruguay, and more recently Argentina, have
steadily increased their shares.
    EU diplomats say the European Commission would look to raise
the U.S. share of the quota to at least 40 or 50 percent.
    While other countries considered to be ""substantial""
suppliers would have to accept less, that may mean Brussels only
needs to get backing from Australia and Uruguay, with
Argentina's share just below 10 percent.
    USMEF economist Erin Borror said that quarterly quota
allocations were typically filled within two weeks, so U.S. beef
could only enter Europe duty-free for a few days. 
    ""Depending upon what agreement is reached, we foresee demand
in Europe (for U.S. beef) being strong enough to easily double
that value from the $200 million mark to $400 million,"" she
said.
    EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan has said a settlement
on beef would ease overall trade tensions across the Atlantic.
    The EU's argument to other big beef exporters to Europe is
likely to be that the entire quota could go if there is no deal
with the United States.
    ""It can be put to them as either less or nothing,"" one EU
diplomat said.

    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
rose to new highs on Tuesday after Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria's address to parliament on the government's budget plans
did little to reassure nervous investors. 
    Tria called for a constructive discussion with Brussels over
the budget and said he did not think Italy's deficit forecasts
were so shocking. The EU Commission Vice-President Jyrki
Katainen said Italy's situation is very vulnerable, and
negotiations may prove very difficult. [nR1N1VZ01H] [nR1N1VZ01J]
    As a war of war of words between Rome and the European Union
over Italy's spending plans has ratcheted up in recent days,
Italian bonds, stocks and the euro have taken a fresh hit.
    ""Maybe some people were expecting some reassurance from
Tria, but he's not calling the shots,"" said Jan von Gerich,
chief analyst at Nordea. ""The general background is that the
budget continues to cause uncertainty.""    
    Italy's 30-year bond yield rose above 4 percent for the
first time since August 2014, and was last up five basis points
on the day <IT30YT=RR>.
    Five-year Italian bond yields rose to 3.13 percent
<IT5YT=RR>, their highest level in almost five years, while
10-year bond yields jumped over 10 bps to a new 4-1/2 year high
at 3.71 percent <IT10YT=RR>. 
    This pushed the premium investors demand for holding Italian
10-year bonds over top-rated Germany <DE10YT=RR> to its widest
point in five years at around 312 basis points.
    Analysts said talk of a report that the European Commission
was likely to reject Italian budget plans was putting pressure
on Italian bonds. 
    The European Commission is not due to express a first
opinion on the Italian budget until November.
    It has told Italy it is concerned about the budget deficit
plans for the next three years since they breach what the EU
asked Rome to do in July.
    ""Instability and uncertainty is here to stay,"" said one
Milan-based rates strategist who asked not to be named.
    ""There is a power struggle between the government, EU
institutions and financial markets and we are nowhere near the
end of the confrontation.""
    Italy's bond market had shown some signs of stabilising
early on Tuesday on hopes that Tria would strike a more
conciliatory tone in parliament.
    The euro has also taken a hit from concerns about tension
between the EU and Italy, languishing near a seven-week low
<EUR=>.
    ""At the moment investors are puzzled because it is so
uncertain where this is going to end, that spread could really
go anywhere,"" said a senior banker at one of Italy's primary
dealers - banks appointed by governments to buy bonds at
government auctions. He preferred to remain unnamed as he is not
authorised to speak about his clients. 
    Spanish and Portuguese bond yields rose to their highest
levels since May and June respectively <ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR>,
but those markets have not seen heavy selling - suggesting that
contagion from Italy remains limited.
    In fact, most bond yields in the bloc were a touch higher -
feeling the pull of a rise in U.S. Treasury yields to fresh
multi-year highs on Tuesday. [nL4N1WP1E1]
    U.S. Treasury yields have been rising on the back of a
strengthening economy and on expectations the Federal Reserve
will continue to hike rates as a result.
    German and French 10-year yields rose one to two basis
points each at 0.55 percent and 0.90 percent respectively.

    By Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The leader of Northern Ireland's
biggest party on Tuesday ruled out any checks on trade with the
British mainland after the EU's Brexit negotiator tried to
persuade her that such controls could be ""de-dramatised"".
    Arlene Foster, whose Democratic Unionist Party props up
Prime Minister Theresa May's government in London, said the DUP
would never accept the regulatory or customs controls that the
EU's Michel Barnier says are an essential ""backstop"" to avoid a
hard land border with EU member Ireland after Britain leaves.
    ""There is only one red line,"" Foster told reporters after
her meeting with Barnier in Brussels, as he presses to secure a
deal on the Irish border issue that can unlock a withdrawal
accord with London in time for a summit next Wednesday.
    ""We could not support any arrangement which could give rise
to either customs or regulatory barriers within the UK internal
market,"" Foster said, adding that she looked forward to further
meetings in Brussels over the coming two days.
    Barnier tweeted after their meeting that he was ""working
hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop"" -- a text by
which the EU proposes keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU
economic space in the event that a future EU-UK free trade deal
fails to find a way to avoid disruptive checks on their land
frontier.
    EU negotiators have floated ideas about making customs and
regulatory checks on goods by discreet technical means well away
from sea transit routes between Britain's mainland and its Irish
province to try to overcome objections from Foster -- and May --
that such differences undermine the United Kingdom's integrity.
    Asked about that push to ""de-dramatise"" checks if the
backstop were triggered, Foster said: ""The whole point of checks
is there's a difference. Why would we need checks ... if we were
an integral part of the single market of the United Kingdom?""
    She said she had yet to see new proposals that May plans to
put to Barnier in a bid to address the problem.
    Pressed on whether the DUP was prepared to block a Brexit
deal and so pitch Britain into a ""no-deal"" scenario next March,
Foster said she believed her party was not alone in its view,
and that she expected May to respect its position.

 (Add details on climate discussions)
    By Daphne Psaledakis
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union nations will
seek a compromise on Tuesday over how ambitious to be on cutting
vehicle emissions and climate goals for U.N. talks, with Germany
warning that targets that are too tough risk harming industry
and costing jobs.
    In a clash between concerns over the environmental risk of
emissions and industry competitiveness, EU environment ministers
meeting in Luxembourg are divided over what 2030 carbon dioxide
limits to impose on Europe's powerful carmakers.
    In the wake of a U.N. report calling for rapid and
unprecedented change to contain global warming, many ministers
back a 40 percent reduction in emissions, in line with climate
targets backed by EU lawmakers last week.  [nL4N1WO1TL]
    ""Everyone is calling for action after the report from
climate experts,"" French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy
said.
    But two EU sources said some EU nations appeared to be
siding with a less ambitious reduction in emissions. 
    Germany, with its big auto sector, backs an EU executive
proposal of a 30 percent cut for fleets of new cars and vans by
2030, compared to 2021 levels. [nL8N1WI1K1] [nL8N1WC3PB]
    ""After the IPCC report yesterday that is not easy, but it is
a position we all agreed on,"" Germany's Svenja Schulze said.
    
    TOO CLOSE TO CALL
    Climate campaigners say Germany has still not learned to be
tougher on the auto industry despite the scandal that engulfed
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> in 2015 when it admitted that it had
masked exhaust emissions using software in as many as 11 million
diesel vehicles worldwide. [nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    EU sources said Germany, with the backing of eastern
European nations, might have enough votes to secure a majority
at the meeting among the bloc's 28 nations.
    Austria, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, has
proposed a compromise of a 35 percent reduction in emissions.
    ""It's too close to call,"" said Greg Archer, an expert with
Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. 
    If they reach an agreement, talks on the final law could
begin with the EU's two other lawmaking bodies as early as
Wednesday.
    The new rules will also create a crediting system that would
allow carmakers to lower their CO2 targets by meeting a
benchmark for selling zero- and low-emission vehicles as a share
of their total new car sales. [nL8N1WJ305]

    CLIMATE AMBITION
    Curbs on the transport sector, the only industry in which
emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its goal
of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990
levels by 2030.
    Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this
summer fuelled concerns that climate change was gathering pace,
leading dozens of countries to call for greenhouse gas emissions
to be cut at a faster rate than planned.
    But a call by the EU's climate commissioner and others for
the bloc to pledge to cut emissions by 45 percent as part of the
Paris Agreement has met resistance. [nL8N1VH0FI]
    The draft text for Tuesday's meeting in Luxembourg, seen by
Reuters and which will serve as the EU's position for U.N.
climate talks in Poland in December, says the level of reduction
remains an outstanding issue among member states.
    Rasing it would require the approval all 28 nations. That
may be too complicated to achieve before the U.N. talks,
European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic told Reuters.
    The EU is likely exceed its Paris pledge to reduce emissions
by 40 percent from 1990 levels, he added, following a reform of
the bloc's Emission Trading System (ETS) and new targets set on
renewable energy and energy efficiency.
    ""We do not need new legislation on this one because
everything is already done. We are just going to get better
results than expected,"" Sefcovic told Reuters on Monday.

    Italy's populist coalition government, made up of the

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/London-October 09: Fitch Ratings has affirmed KAF 
Kaerntner Ausgleichszahlungs-Fonds' (KAF) zero-coupon bonds (XS1484645616 and 
XS1484645533) with an aggregate principal amount of EUR1.1 billion, due 14 
January 2032, at 'AA+'. The zero-coupon bonds are explicitly, unconditionally 
and irrevocably guaranteed by the Republic of Austria (Austria; AA+/Positive).

The affirmation reflects that there have been no changes to the guarantee 
mechanism or dilution of support from the guarantor. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The ratings on the zero-coupon bonds are equalised with that of Austria as the 
obligations under the guarantee constitute the sovereign's direct, unsecured, 
unconditional, irrevocable and unsubordinated debt. They also rank pari passu 
with all the sovereign's unsecured and unsubordinated loan or bond indebtedness, 
except for obligations ranking in priority pursuant to mandatory provisions of 
law.

KAF was established by the KAF Law in November 2015. It is a special purpose 
vehicle created by the Province of Carinthia to acquire HETA Asset Resolution 
AG's (HETA) bonds that are guaranteed by Carinthia and the Holding Company of 
Carinthia (Kaerntner Landesholding). KAF was formed to take on risks stemming 
from liabilities assumed by Carinthia and the Holding Company of Carinthia 
through bond acquisition. The SPV also ensures Carinthia and its legal bodies 
have the capacity to carry out their designated tasks and prevent serious damage 
to the national economy.

KAF submitted a tender offer to all HETA creditors on 6 September 2016 to 
acquire certain debt instruments of HETA. According to the offered tender, HETA 
creditors were given the option either to settle their holdings by cash or to 
exchange for the zero-coupon bonds issued by KAF. 

The cash settlement option offered to acquire HETA's bonds at a haircut. This 
corresponded to 75% of senior creditors' outstanding nominal claims of EUR10.2 
billion and 30% of subordinated creditors' outstanding nominal claims of EUR0.9 
billion. The zero-coupon bond exchange option offered senior creditors to 
exchange their HETA instruments for the zero-coupon bond at a conversion rate of 
1 to 1. Subordinated creditors had the option to exchange their HETA instruments 
for either a zero-coupon bond at a conversion rate of 1 to 2 or unsecured 
assignable loans issued by Austria at a ratio of 1 to 1. As some of the 
subordinated creditors chose the second option, a loan was issued as well. 

The tender offer was subject to the approval of a minimum of 25% of senior 
creditors and 25% of subordinated creditors, and two-thirds of all classes. 
Finally, 99.55% of senior creditors and 89.42% of subordinated creditors and 
98.71% of all classes accepted the offer, so that the tender offer was 
successfully completed.

The zero-coupon bond had a repurchase commitment of the KAF. This means the 
issuer granted the beneficial owners of the bonds the right to require the 
issuer to repurchase the bonds at a fixed repurchase price calculated on a daily 
basis. The 180-day repurchase period started 1 December 2016 and ended 30 May 
2017. On 30 May 2017, KAF repurchased zero-coupon bonds with a nominal amount of 
EUR9,195,556,007 (89.24% of the zero coupon bond proceeds outstanding). The 
buyback of the KAF bonds was mainly funded by the Austrian government, which 
provided funds via the Abbaumanagementgesellschaft des Bundes (ABBAG), the 
wind-down management company of Austria. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

An upgrade of Austria's ratings would result in similar rating action on the 
bonds, provided the guarantee remains unchanged.

Negative rating action on Austria will be reflected in the bonds' rating. 
Dilution of support from the guarantor as well as a change in or termination of 
the guarantee would result in a review of the bonds' rating.

 (Adds European Commission reaction, industry comment)
    By Huw Jones and William Schomberg
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of England urged the
European Union on Tuesday to do more to protect cross-border
financial services from the risks of a ""cliff-edge Brexit"",
saying the need for action was now pressing.
    Less than six months before Britain is due to leave the EU,
creating the potential for new barriers for companies doing
business across the English Channel, the BoE said in its
strongest warning so far that it saw risks for insurance,
derivatives and the transfer of data.
    London and Brussels have yet to agree the terms of Britain's
departure from the bloc and their new relationship, a deal that
would mean business as usual until the end of 2020.
    ""There has been considerable progress in the UK to address
these risks, but only limited progress in the EU,"" the central
bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said in a statement
published on Tuesday after a meeting on Oct. 3.
    ""In the limited time remaining, it is not possible for
companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption
to cross-border financial services. The need for authorities to
complete mitigating actions is now pressing.""
    Bankers say Brussels wants to pile pressure on banks,
insurers and fund managers in London to open up new hubs in
rival EU financial centres such as Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin.
    The European Commission said on Tuesday it has consistently
encouraged all stakeholders in financial services to prepare for
Brexit, and that it continued to analyse with the European
Central Bank possible risks for markets.
    The EU executive will review the situation after an EU
summit next week that seeks to finalise Britain's exit deal and
transition period, a Commission spokesman said.
    The industry is also waiting to see what steps if any a
joint BoE and ECB working group will take to keep markets
orderly around Brexit Day.
        
    NO TIME
    Derivatives with a nominal value of 41 trillion pounds would
face legal uncertainty if the EU took no action in the event of
a no-deal Brexit, the BoE said.
    On insurance, even if companies based in Britain complete
planned moves of their European business to the EU before March,
around 9 million policyholders in the bloc would still be under
the shadow of uncertainty after March, it said.
    Britain is approving a law that would temporarily allow EU
financial firms to continue doing business here in the event of
a no-deal Brexit and wants the EU to do likewise, but Brussels
has so far refused.
    ""Financial stability should not be jeopardised in a game of
high-stakes political poker,"" said Catherine McGuinness,
political leader of the City of London financial district.
    LCH in London, which clears most euro-denominated interest
rate swaps, faces having to force EU-based members to shift
their contracts to rivals in the bloc, a costly undertaking.
    LCH had no immediate comment.
    The FPC also said it was keeping its capital buffer rate for
banks unchanged, noting restraint among borrowers, although it
said it was concerned by fast growth in lending to riskier,
highly indebted companies.
    Banks generally hold enough core capital to cope with a
disorderly Brexit, it said.
    Britain's banks are required to meet a so-called
countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) of 1 percent of their
risk-weighted assets as part of BoE efforts to avoid a repeat of
the taxpayer bailouts after the global financial crisis.
    The FPC said it would review the CCyB level at its next
meeting on Nov. 28.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona/London-October 09: Fitch Ratings has affirmed 
Spanish-based Cecabank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-' with 
Stable Outlook. At the same time the agency has affirmed the bank's Viability 
Rating (VR) at 'bbb-'. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of 
this rating action commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

IDRS AND VR

The ratings of Cecabank reflect its well-established specialised franchise in 
custody and administration services (including reconciliation of securities 
services and verification of asset valuation), treasury activities and 
transactional services within the Spanish market. The bank has achieved 
sustained growth while maintaining a moderate risk appetite, stable funding and 
liquidity and adequate capitalisation. 

The ratings also factor in the bank's geographically concentrated franchise in 
Spain and in a few large customers, a small equity base, modest profitability 
and exposure to operational risk, although the latter is well-managed.

 

Cecabank has strengthened its specialised franchise in the last few years. We 
expect the bank to continue growing its business volumes and services offer 
while expanding in other markets, mainly Portugal, where the bank has recently 
opened a branch, without increasing its risk appetite. Consistent growth in 
custody, cash management volumes and other banking services in the last few 
years has helped provide some stability to revenue. 

Cecabank's established IT infrastructure and an increased regulatory burden on 
the securities service sector, in particular, have contributed to the bank's 
strategic role as an independent financial services provider in the domestic 
market. However, the bank still relies on a small number of customers to 
generate large business volumes and, to some extent, on treasury activities that 
are sensitive to the interest rate cycle and market volatility. 

Risk-weighted capital ratios are sound and the bank aims to maintain its fully 
loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio above 20%, including in the event of further 
business expansion. In our assessment of capital, we also factor in the bank's 
small equity base.

Cecabank's funding and liquidity are stable and reflect the bank's business 
model. Although Cecabank's reliance on wholesale funding is high, a large 
proportion of deposits are institutional customers' operational balances (such 
as clearing and settlement accounts), which tend to be stable. The bank 
maintains adequate liquidity buffers. 

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

The Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect Fitch's 
belief that senior creditors can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary 
support from the sovereign if the bank becomes non-viable. The EU's Bank 
Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism for 
eurozone banks provide a framework for resolving banks that is likely to require 
senior creditors to participate in losses, instead of or ahead of a bank 
receiving sovereign support.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

IDRS AND VR

Rating upside could arise if Cecabank improves its franchise, resulting in a 
less concentrated client base. 

The ratings are sensitive to an operational loss event that could cause 
reputational damage affecting the bank's franchise and leading to pressure on 
business volumes. Downward rating pressure could also arise if the risk appetite 
increases materially or risk control systems lag behind business growth.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

An upgrade of the Support Rating and upward revision of the Support Rating Floor 
would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to 
support domestic banks. This is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view, although not 
impossible.

 

The rating actions are as follows: 

Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable

Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3'

Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-'

Support Rating affirmed at '5'

Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'No floor'

    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - If British Prime Minister Theresa
May is able to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union in
the coming weeks, she will face a crucial vote in parliament
when she asks lawmakers to approve it.
    How will the vote in parliament work?
   
    WHAT DOES MAY HAVE TO DO? 
    - If a deal has been agreed, May has to present to
parliament:
    1) A statement saying political agreement has been reached
    2) The negotiated withdrawal agreement
    3) The framework for the future relationship with the EU
    - Ministers must also arrange a debate on the deal. In the
directly elected lower house of parliament this will conclude
with a vote on a motion stating that parliament has approved the
deal. This is the big vote.
    - Opponents of May's strategy are likely to try to put
forward amendments to the government motion, which could be put
to a separate vote. These could include changing the wording to
make acceptance of the deal conditional upon it being approved
by a referendum.
    If any of these amendments pass, it would be considered a
defeat for the government. Although not legally binding, they
would be hard to ignore.
    The order of votes - whether amendments are voted upon
before the government motion, or vice versa - will be determined
closer to the time.
    - The unelected upper house of parliament, the House of
Lords, will also debate the deal, but will only be asked to
""take note"" of it. The Lords will not get a straight ""approve""
or ""reject"" vote, and will not have the power to block the deal.
    - The legislation defining the procedure for parliamentary
approval does not specify how quickly after a deal is announced
the vote will happen. It only stipulates that ministers should
try to hold it before the European Parliament has its own vote. 
        
    WHAT WILL LAWMAKERS VOTE ON?
    Lawmakers will be voting on whether to approve a package
consisting of:
    1) The withdrawal agreement - a legal text setting out
issues such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, a
backstop for the Irish border, and the terms of an
implementation period designed to smooth the exit process.
    2) The future relationship framework - a non-legal document
defining how Britain and the EU will work together in the long
term on issues such as trade and security. 
    These two documents define the deal May and her team have
been negotiating with the European Commission since June 2017.
    
    WHO GETS TO VOTE?
    There are 650 elected lawmakers in Britain's House of
Commons. Excluding non-voting members such as the speaker and
others who never take up their seats, around 320 votes are
needed to be certain of winning a vote. The actual number needed
for victory depends on abstentions and absences on the day.
    The vote is decided by a simple majority. Whichever side has
more votes wins.    
    
    HOW WILL THE RESULT BE ANNOUNCED?
    At the end of the debate, the speaker will typically ask for
those in favour of the motion to shout ""aye"", and then those
against to say ""no"". As long as some lawmakers shout ""no"", the
speaker will call for a formal vote, known as a division.
    Votes are registered by lawmakers walking through different
doorways, out of sight of television cameras and onlookers. Once
the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minutes -
lawmakers return to the debating chamber.
    Four appointed tellers will assemble in front of the
speaker, and one will read the result out loud. 
       
    HOW WILL THE PARTIES VOTE?
    The ruling Conservative Party has 315 lawmakers. It governs
with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10
lawmakers of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    But May's party is not united behind her current plan.
Eurosceptics think it leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, and
pro-EU lawmakers say the ties are not close enough. Both groups
are potentially large enough to inflict defeat.
    The support of the 10 DUP lawmakers is dependent on the
solution agreed on the Irish border. They have said they will
not support any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to
different rules to the rest of the country.
    The opposition Labour Party has 257 lawmakers. Led by Jeremy
Corbyn, the party has pledged to vote down any deal that does
not meet its criteria. The plans currently under discussion are
unlikely to do this, so most Labour lawmakers can be expected to
vote against May.
    However, some who disagree with Corbyn's stance could rebel
and vote with the government in order to avoid the risk of
leaving without a deal. Media reports have said May is courting
these Labour ""moderates"".
    The Scottish National Party's 35 lawmakers are expected to
vote against the government deal, as are the 12 Liberal
Democrats.
        
    IF MAY WINS, IS THAT IT?
    No. Although the vote is the focal point for resistance to
the deal, the government is also required to pass separate
legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement and complete
the ratification process.
    This legislation will be known as the EU (Withdrawal
Agreement) Bill. It will be subject to full scrutiny in
parliament, involving multiple rounds of possible amending and
voting. It has to be passed before March 29, 2019.
    This process is unlikely to be used to unpick the deal as
the legislation will be implementing what has already been
approved by parliament. However, if parliament feels as if May
has ignored its wishes and is forcing the deal through, it could
use the bill to stall the exit process.
    
    WHAT IF MAY LOSES?
    This would be a politically explosive outcome that could
topple May and her government. There are legislative guidelines
on what happens next, but they could be overtaken by events.
    By law, if the government motion is rejected, ministers have
21 days to set out in a statement how they intend to proceed.
The government has said that if their deal is rejected, Britain
will leave the EU without a deal.
    It then has to call a fresh debate in parliament that could
give lawmakers another chance to set out amendments -
effectively giving parliament a vote on an alternative path.
These amendments would not be binding, but if approved May would
again find them hard to ignore.

    By Edward Taylor
    FRANKFURT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - German auto parts supplier
Bosch [ROBG.UL] is launching an electric van-sharing service in
Germany, expanding its reach in rentals and pitting it against
some of its customers who are also expanding into pay-per-minute
mobility services.
    Bosch said on Tuesday it will team up with toom, part of
German retailer REWE, to supply battery-driven vans which people
can hire to transport bulky purchases from hardware stores. 
    German cities are banning older diesel vehicles, hastening
the switch to electric and benefiting firms like Bosch, which 
supplies components to electric vehicle makers.
    Combined with the emergence of smartphone-hailed rental
technology, which allows people to use vehicles by the minute
without owning them, this is turning the relationship between
car manufacturers and their suppliers on its head.
    ""A service for sharing electric vans has huge potential for
growth,"" Rainer Kallenbach, president of the Connected Mobility
Solutions division at Bosch said in a statement.
    The Bosch electric vans will be supplied by StreetScooter, a
German startup carmaker owned by logistics company Deutsche Post
<DPWGn.DE>, which uses powertrain components supplied by Bosch.
    StreetScooter on Tuesday unveiled a separate alliance with
Ford <F.N> to build larger electric delivery vans for logistics
company DHL.[L8N1WP4DL]
    
    SELF-DRIVING 
    The market for electric delivery vans is expected to grow
after Germany's highest court in February allowed cities to ban
older diesel vehicles and after Berlin on Tuesday was forced to
consider imposing bans to improve air quality.[nL8N1QH2L1]
    EU lawmakers last week backed a plan to cut carbon dioxide
emissions from cars and vans by an ambitious 40 percent by 2030,
a target which the car industry, already struggling to meet
emissions standards, said is completely unrealistic.[nL8N1WJ305]
    Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Europe's largest carmaker by sales,
and a large maker of diesel vehicles on Tuesday revealed that
Europe sales had fallen 42.6 percent as it struggles to adapt
engines to new clear air standards.[nL8N1WP3U5][nW8N13100M]
    Opel said it would discontinue its Adam, KARL and Cascada
models in 2019 to help the carmaker meet emissions rules.
    Stuttgart-based Bosch said that if the electric van sharing
service proves popular, its plans to expand it to other partners
including supermarkets and furniture stores.
    The toom alliance marks a further step into on-demand
vehicle rental services for Bosch, which already runs Coup, an
electric scooter rental service, in Paris, Berlin and Madrid.
    Bosch has shied away from competing against traditional
automakers in areas like vehicle manufacturing, fearing it could
alienate components and systems clients like VW and Ford.
    But with new rivals like software company alphabet <GOOGL.O>
developing fully fledged self-driving vehicles, auto suppliers
and carmakers are ramping up efforts to understand
smartphone-based mobility as a prelude to managing fleets of
robotaxis.
    Self-driving cars will allow carmakers and software
companies to offer ride-hailing without having to pay drivers.  
 
    Bosch is already collaborating with Mercedes-Benz parent
Daimler <DAIGn.DE> to develop self-driving cars. [nL1N1U61BN]

 (Recasts with turnaround in bond market, adds details, Tria
comments, quotes)
    By Virginia Furness, Dhara Ranasinghe and Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
fell from multi-year highs on Tuesday after Economy Minister
Giovanni Tria pledged to do whatever is necessary to restore
calm if market turbulence turns into a financial crisis.
    As Italian bond yields have risen sharply in the past two
sessions, analysts said some investors were also encouraged to
move back into the battered bond market. 
    Tria called on Tuesday for more measured debate over
government budget plans, and said that in the face of a crisis
the government would ""do what it must do, as (ECB President
Mario) Draghi did,"" making reference to his 2012 speech to halt
the euro debt crisis. [nL8N1WP21C]
    Bond yields had initially risen after Tria's speech, which
was not seen as reassuring for financial markets. However his
subsequent comments appeared to trigger a turnaround. 
    Italian equities also firmed into the market close and were
last up over one percent, outperforming their European peers
<.FTMIB>.
    In late trade, bond yields were down as much as 11 basis
points. Italy's 30-year bond yield was at 3.96 pct, having risen
above four percent for the first time since August 2014
<IT30YT=RR>.
    ""We've had (Luigi) di Maio and (Matteo) Salvini saying they
won't give into market pressure while Tria's comments suggest
the government would at some point,"" said Jack Allen, senior
European economist at Capital Economics in London, referring to
the co-leaders of Italy's populist coalition government. 
    ""So those comments have bought some calm to the market. Our
view is that yields will rise again as economic growth
disappoints and the budget deficit rises.""
    Five-year Italian bond yields were at 2.89 percent, having
risen to 3.13 percent <IT5YT=RR>, their highest level in almost
five years, while 10-year bond yields came off a new 4-1/2 year
high at 3.71 percent to close at 3.52 percent <IT10YT=RR>. 
    The premium investors demand for holding Italian 10-year
bonds over top-rated Germany <DE10YT=RR> had reached its widest
point in five years at around 312 basis points before receding
to 297 basis points. 
    Analysts said the fact Italy's budget office said on Tuesday
the country's growth targets were too optimistic may have raised
hopes that the budget plans would be revised correspondingly. 
    The European Commission has told Italy it is concerned about
the budget deficit plans for the next three years since they
breach what the EU asked Rome to do in July.
    ""Instability and uncertainty is here to stay,"" said one
Milan-based rates strategist who asked not to be named.
    ""There is a power struggle between the government, EU
institutions and financial markets and we are nowhere near the
end of the confrontation.""
    Spanish and Portuguese bond yields briefly rose to their
highest levels since May and June respectively <ES10YT=RR>
<PT10YT=RR>, but those markets have not seen heavy selling -
suggesting that contagion from Italy remains limited.
    In fact, most bond yields in the bloc inched lower as U.S.
markets opened after Monday's public holiday and Treasury yields
pulled back from multi-year highs. 
    U.S. Treasury yields have risen sharply in recent sessions
on the back of a strengthening economy and on expectations the
Federal Reserve will continue to hike rates as a result.
    German and French 10-year yields rose one to two basis
points each at 0.55 percent and 0.90 percent respectively.

 (Updates with agreement on climate goals)
    By Daphne Psaledakis
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union nations,
voicing worries over a U.N. report on global warming, were
haggling on Tuesday over how ambitious to be in cutting vehicle
emissions, with Germany warning that overly-challenging targets
risked harming industry and jobs.
    Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry
competitiveness, EU environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg
are seeking a compromise over what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to
impose on Europe's powerful carmakers.
    In a joint statement, they said the bloc was ""deeply
concerned"" over a U.N. report calling for rapid and
unprecedented action to contain global warming, but held back
from increasing their pledge to reduce emissions under the 2015
Paris climate accord. [nL4N1WO1TL]
    Several ministers sought a higher, 40 percent reduction in
vehicle emissions, in line with targets backed by EU lawmakers
last week. ""Everyone is calling for action after the report,""
French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy said. [nL8N1WJ305] 
    But two EU sources said some nations appeared to be siding
with a less ambitious reduction. 
    Germany, with its big auto sector, backs an EU executive
proposal for a 30 percent cut for fleets of new cars and vans by
2030, compared with 2021 levels. [nL8N1WI1K1] [nL8N1WC3PB]
    ""After the (U.N.) report yesterday that is not easy, but it
is a position we all agreed on,"" Germany's Svenja Schulze said.
    
    TOO CLOSE TO CALL
    Climate campaigners say Germany has still not learned to be
tougher on the auto industry, despite the scandal that engulfed
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> in 2015 when it admitted to using illegal
software to mask emissions on up to 11 million diesel vehicles
worldwide. [nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    EU sources said Germany, with the backing of eastern
European nations, might have enough votes to secure a majority
at the meeting among the bloc's 28 nations.
    Austria, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, has
proposed a compromise 35 percent reduction in emissions.
    ""It's too close to call,"" said Greg Archer, an expert with
Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. 
    If they reach an agreement, talks on the final law could
begin with the EU's two other lawmaking bodies.
    The new rules will also create a crediting system that will
allow carmakers to lower their CO2 targets by meeting a
benchmark for selling zero- and low-emission vehicles as a share
of their total new car sales. [nL8N1WJ305]

    CLIMATE AMBITION
    Curbs on the transport sector, the only industry in which
emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its goal
of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990
levels by 2030.
    Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this
summer have fuelled concerns climate change is gathering pace,
leading some countries to call for emissions to be cut at a
faster rate than planned.
    But a call by the EU's climate commissioner and 15 EU
nations for the bloc to increase its pledge to cut emissions by
45 percent under the Paris accord has met with resistance.
[nL8N1VH0FI]
    Ahead of U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, the
bloc's 28 environment ministers renewed their commitment to
leading the fight to limiting global warming.
    They said the EU was ready to ""communicate or update"" its
Nationally Determined Contribution, the efforts by each country
to reduce emissions, by 2020.
    Raising it would require the approval of all 28 nations.
    That may be too hard to achieve before the U.N. talks,
European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said, but the
bloc is likely to exceed its Paris pledge following a reform of
its Emission Trading System (ETS) and new targets on renewable
energy and energy efficiency.
    ""We do not need new legislation on this one because
everything is already done. We are just going to get better
results than expected,"" Sefcovic told Reuters on Monday.

    * Comes after labour reform, corporate tax cuts

    PARIS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - French lawmakers gave their backing
in a first reading on Tuesday to an overhaul of corporate law
aimed at cutting red tape for companies and setting several
privatisations in motion.
    The legislation is part of President Emmanuel Macron's
pro-business reform drive that has already eased labour laws and
cut taxes on companies and entrepreneurs.    
    The law aims to make it faster and cheaper to register and
wind down companies while also simplifying a complex system that
imposes new regulations in multiple stages as firms increase
their workforce.
    It includes incentives to make profit-sharing more common
among small firms and encourage employees' voluntary
contributions to all types of savings products.
    The bill also sets the stage for several large
privatisations already flagged by the government, with the
proceeds due to finance a new 10 billion euros ($11.49
billion)innovation fund.
    It will in particular lift legal restraints on selling down
stakes in airport operator ADP <ADP.PA> and energy group Engie
<ENGIE.PA> while allowing the national lottery FDJ to be
privatised. [nFWN1WM03X]
    Some 361 lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted in
favour of the law while 84 were against and 103 abstained from
voting. 
    The bill now goes before the Senate for consideration in
January before returning to the lower house for a final vote.

    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Brexit minister Dominic
Raab voiced confidence on Tuesday that Britain and the European
Union would make progress on their divorce at a summit next
week, but again asked the bloc to meet London ""halfway"" on the

    Brexit negotiations have stepped up before the summit next

officials believe a deal is within grasp. But one of the most
difficult obstacles to securing the so-called withdrawal

deal"" Brexit that could harm the world's fifth largest economy.
    ""The October council next week of course will be an
important milestone - we expect that to be a moment where we
will make some progress,"" Raab told parliament when asked why he
was no longer suggesting there could be a deal at the meeting.
    ""The negotiations were always bound to be tough in the final
stretch. That's all the more reason why we should hold our
nerve, stay resolute and focused, and I remain confident we will
reach a deal this autumn.""
    Britain is keen to move forward on a future relationship,
especially after Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals, already
in doubt among many of her governing Conservatives, were widely
criticised at an EU summit in Austria last month.
    At his latest appearance in parliament, where divisions over
how to leave the EU were on display, Raab moved to downplay one
of the thorniest parts of the talks - a so-called backstop
arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border between the
British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
    He again said that a future partnership that ensured
frictionless trade would mean there would be no need for such a
backstop, which would only be used if there was no agreement, or
if the two sides were not ready to put that deal, in place.
    ""We want to pursue the frictionless trade with the EU that
we have now, and that's what our proposal will deliver. But of
course it requires the EU to meet us half way,"" Raab said.
        
    ""RED LINE""
    How to prevent the return of a hard border, which some say
could reignite sectarian divisions on the island of Ireland, has
become one of the hardest hurdles to clear for both sides.
    The small Northern Irish party which props up May's
government again drew what it described as the ""only one red
line"" in its talks in Brussels on Tuesday, ruling out any checks
on trade with the British mainland after Brexit. [nL8N1WP2QS]
    ""We could not support any arrangement which could give rise
to either customs or regulatory barriers within the UK internal
market,"" Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
said after meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
    In parliament, her deputy Nigel Dodds rammed the point home,
warning Raab not to ""repeat that mistake"" from December - when
the DUP almost pulled the rug out from an interim accord
negotiated by May by scuppering a proposal that would have seen
regulatory alignment between the EU and the
province.[nL8N1O42P5]
    Raab reiterated that the government would not do anything to
compromise the integrity of the United Kingdom, adding that
officials had long cautioned that any deal could be pushed back
to a special meeting in November. 
    But one EU diplomat was upbeat, saying the divorce deal, or
withdrawal agreement, could be concluded by Monday and that
officials were working on a proposal to avoid Britain having to
come up with a separate backstop plan as a possible solution.
    For now, the ""intense"" negotiations are ongoing.[nL9N1S905H]

recommended the reallocation on Tuesday of 3 billion euros of
the country's 8.5 billion euro sovereign wealth fund away from
its initial broad investment strategy to government priority
areas. 
    The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) was established
in 2014 from the cash left in the country's pension reserve fund
following the financial crash to invest on a commercial basis in
supporting economic activity and employment in Ireland.
    The government said in July it would refocus the fund to
meet the needs of an economy that had since grown rapidly.
    In a review published on Tuesday, the finance department
said the reallocation of ISIF's excess capacity would allow
government to set up a 'rainy day fund' and ease infrastructure
constraints. [nL8N1U151E]
    Dublin had previously announced that the rainy day fund - a
new contingency reserve - would be initiated with 1.5 billion
euros from ISIF but the the finance department detailed on
Tuesday how the other 1.5 billion could be put into a dedicated
side-portfolio to target strategic infrastructure projects.
    This side-portfolio would allow ISIF to undertake a higher
level of risk as it would not need to be diversified like the
remainder of its portfolio and could fund investments that would
not impact the government's budgetary position, the review said.
    The specific strategic infrastructure sectors should be
determined by government as part of the budgetary process, it
added.
    ISIF had identified the potential reallocation of up to 2
billion euros of its resources, the review said. 
    The finance department identified the higher figure taking
account of dividends paid to the fund by majority state-owned
Allied Irish Banks <AIBG.I> and funding for the state's water
utility which will be replaced with sovereign debt funding.

    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The leaders of Italy's ruling
parties said on Tuesday they would permit no change to the
government's 2019 budget plan, despite financial market pressure
and criticism from the country's central bank and the
parliamentary fiscal watchdog.
    Speaking jointly to reporters, Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi
Di Maio and Matteo Salvini reiterated they would not change the
target of a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product for next year.
    That was three times the forecast of the previous
centre-left administration and sparked criticism from the
European Commission and a rise in yields on Italian government
bonds.
    Backtracking on the budget would mean ""betraying the
Italians"", said Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement.
    Salvini, who leads the right-wing League, said he was
convinced the expansionary budget would yield economic growth of
2 percent next year, rather than the 1.5 percent official
forecast the government set this month.
    Italy's fiscal watchdog, the parliamentary budget office
(UPB), earlier on Tuesday refused to validate the government's
multi-year budget plan, saying its forecasts for economic growth
were too optimistic.
    The planning document projected growth targets of 1.5
percent next year, 1.6 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.
    The government can ignore the UPB's verdict, but if it does
so parliament can call on the economy minister to explain why.
    The Bank of Italy warned on Tuesday that lowering the
retirement age, as the government plans, could put the
sustainability of the pension system at risk.
    Di Maio shot back that the 2011 reform that hiked the
retirement age, approved by a technocratic government, had ""not
been voted for by anybody,"" and those who want to maintain it
should have the courage to run for government.
    Salvini said the people and institutions now criticising the
government's plans were those who had ""brought Italy to
disaster"".
    Shortly before Di Maio and Salvini spoke, Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte said on Facebook the government would not change
its fiscal targets but ""strengthen"" the budget by beefing up
plans for investment.
    Conte, who is close to 5-Star but not a member of either
ruling party, said he would hold a meeting on Wednesday with
state-owned companies to begin putting together a National
Investment Plan.

    By Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries
    DUBLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Ireland's finance minister boosted
budget day spending for the second year in a row as the
government warned of economic ""carnage"" if neighbouring Britain
crashes out of the European Union without a divorce deal.
    Having already pre-committed 2.6 billion euros on increased
public sector and planned infrastructure spending for next year,
Paschal Donohoe, in Tuesday's annual budget speech, almost
doubled the remaining pot to 1.5 billion euros to dish out on
further tax cuts and spending increases.
    The state's fiscal watchdog warned ahead of the budget that
the booming economy did not need such additional stimulus.
    But with an election potentially looming and the
fast-growing economy exacerbating deficits in areas such as
housing, a scrapping of a reduced VAT rate for the hospitality
sector mostly funded the extra 700 million euro of spending. 
    That allowed the government to keep giving workers a small
annual tax break it has promised to continue in future budgets,
reverse welfare cuts imposed during a series of austerity
budgets a decade ago, and boost infrastructure spending.
    ""The shared progress we have made is real. However the risks
and challenges that we now face are equally real,"" Donohoe told
parliament in a speech that went long past the allotted hour as
he reeled off measure after measure but also struck a tone of
caution with 25 different mentions of Brexit.
    Donohoe said the government's ""central case"" was that
Britain and the European Union would reached a Brexit deal in
the coming weeks, but the possibility of a no deal had
influenced the financial decisions made.
    Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned of ""carnage"" if
Britain crashed left without a deal, though he said that would
mostly be felt by Britain, with Ireland likely to benefit from
""huge solidarity"" from fellow EU member states. [nS8N1TE01H]
    A further round of ""Brexit-proofing"" measures, which have
had mixed results to date, were announced in the budget,
including a 300 million euro loan scheme for small and medium
sized businesses and the agriculture and food sectors to invest
in future growth. [nL8N1WM0OI]
    
    BALANCED BUDGET
    Donohoe said the best preparation for Brexit was responsible
budgeting and he intended to balance the state's books for the
first time in more than a decade next year, an improvement on
the tiny deficit originally planned but still not the surplus
the central bank says should already be running. [nL8N1WL4NS]
    The state's independent fiscal watchdog, set up in response
to the years of reckless spending that left the exchequer
massively exposed when the 2008 financial crisis hit, voiced
concerns over the ""not very good budgetary practice"" of recent
years.
    It is particularly worried by successive years of spending
coming in over budget, which it fears will happen again next
year. [nL8N1WO522]
    Hotel and restaurant owners were unhappy at their return to
the standard 13.5 percent VAT from the 9 percent rate introduced
in 2011 to boost the then struggling sector. In a report in
July, Ireland's finance department said the lower rate had
become a ""significant deadweight"". [nL5N1UR5SX]
    ""#Budget19 will be known as an election budget paid for by
the tourism industry,"" Adrian Cummins, head of the Restaurants
Association of Ireland, tweeted.
    Ireland's betting tax was also doubled to 2 percent, hitting
the country's largest operator, Paddy Power Betfair <PPB.I>,
which said it would have cost it 20 million pounds  ($26
million) this year. Its shares closed down 5 percent.
[nFWN1WP0J7]
    Donohoe outlined his planned ""exit tax"" for firms that move
assets or migrate their tax residence from Ireland, setting it
in line with the corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent but
surprising business by introducing it immediately and not by
2020 when Ireland was obliged to come in line with EU rules.
    A company would be liable to pay the exit tax on gains built
up in Ireland from any asset - such as intellectual property -
it planned to move out of the scope of the Irish tax
authorities. The measure is part of a new EU Anti-Tax Avoidance
Directive.    
    The budget will be the last before the next parliamentary
election if Donohoe's Fine Gael-led minority government cannot
agree an extension to its ""confidence and supply"" deal with the
largest opposition party, Fianna Fail. 
    Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said he would seek to open
talks on the expiring deal later on Tuesday and aim to conclude
them by Christmas. [nS8N1VG002]

    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Union no longer
expects a new proposal from Britain for the Ireland-UK border
fix after Brexit and negotiators from both sides are seeking to
narrow differences together in direct talks, diplomatic sources
in Brussels said. 
    That marks a small step forward in the Brexit talks as the
27 states who will remain in the bloc have previously insisted
that London present formal new proposals for the border in
writing.
    Brexit negotiators from both sides - Sabine Weyand for the
EU and Oliver Robbins for Britain - have been locked in Brussels
this week in what one diplomat described as ""tunnel
negotiations"" to narrow down the outstanding differences. 
    The issue of how to preserve an open border between EU state
Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland - Britain's
only land frontier - after Brexit is the last remaining hurdle,
with nearly everything else in the withdrawal agreement agreed
before Britain leaves next March. 
    The 27 EU states will hear on progress at a meeting of 
national ambassadors, without Britain, on Friday evening. The
sides are expected to continue intense negotiations through the
weekend with hopes for a breakthrough as early as Monday. 
    The 27 EU leaders meeting next Wednesday in Brussels want to
be able to announce ""decisive progress"" on the Brexit deal to
agree to hold another summit in November. That would be to
finalise work on a declaration of close future ties with Britain
that would also be part of the Brexit package.
    Both the EU and Britain have signalled progress in recent
days, boosting the sentiment on the market, which fears the most
damaging no-deal Brexit.
    ""My feeling is that there is a smaller probability for lack
of deal now than we have had for some time,"" Danuta Hubner, a
European Parliament lawmaker dealing with Brexit, told a
committee.

the ceiling on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) Greek banks
draw from the domestic central bank by 200 million euros to 5.0
billion euros ($5.74 billion), the Bank of Greece said on
Wednesday.
    The move reflected improved liquidity conditions, taking
into account private sector deposit flows and banks' access to
financial markets, it said. The ELA ceiling is valid through to
Nov 7.
    Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) since February 2015 after being cut off from the ECB's
funding window. Emergency funding is more costly than borrowing
directly from the ECB.
    In June 2016 the ECB reinstated Greek banks' access to its
cheap funding operations, allowing lenders to reduce their
dependence on the emergency liquidity lifeline.
    But with Athens out of its bailout programe since August 21
this year, the ECB has ended a waiver that made Greek government
bonds eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Programmes run by some European
Union countries to sell passports and residency permits to
wealthy foreign citizens pose risks of money laundering as some
of the schemes are not properly managed, campaign groups said on
Wednesday.
    Government schemes to trade citizenship or residence rights
for large investment are currently applied in 13 EU countries:
Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Greece, Latvia, Portugal,
Spain, Ireland, Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and France.
Hungary has terminated its programme.
    ""If you have a lot of money that you acquired through
dubious means, securing a new place to call home far away from
the place you stole from isn't just appealing, it's sensible,""
Naomi Hirst of rights group Global Witness said.
    She said checks on individuals that bought EU citizenship or
residency permits were not satisfactory and exposed countries to
corruption and money laundering risks.
    The joint report by Global Witness and Transparency
International urged the European Union to set standards for

schemes in EU countries by December, an EU official said.
    Acquiring these documents costs on average 900,000 euros,

scheme, while Portugal could earn nearly a billion euros a year,
according to figures cited in the report, called ""European
Getaway – Inside the Murky World of Golden Visas"".
    EU states generated around 25 billion euros in foreign
direct investment in a decade from selling at least 6,000
passports and nearly 100,000 residency permits, the report said
using what it called conservative estimates.
    The report said in Malta, which has raised 718 million euros
from its scheme, applicants who have criminal records or are
under investigation could still be considered eligible ""in
special circumstances"". 
    ""Poorly managed schemes allow corrupt individuals to work
and travel unhindered throughout the EU and undermine our
collective security,"" Laure Brillaud, anti-money laundering
expert at Transparency International, said.
    All the countries who run these schemes, except Britain,
Ireland and Bulgaria, are part of the Schengen free-movement
area which comprises 26 European states.

on the rise but the currency bloc will continue to expand
slightly above what is considered its natural potential,
European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch said on

related to global factors, including the threat of increased
protectionism, the finalisation of the Brexit negotiations and

 (Adds details, analyst quote)
    DUBLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Ireland moved on Wednesday to
sell a new 12-year ""green bond"" in its first foray into an
increasingly popular category of securities that a source said
would likely raise between 2 and 3 billion euros.
    It joins a small number of EU countries including France,
Belgium and Poland in entering a market that earmarks proceeds
for use in financing specific environmentally friendly projects
or initiatives that mitigate the impact of climate change.
    The bond will be priced and issued later on Wednesday, banks
and brokers mandated by the country's debt agency to manage the
deal said.
    Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall
bond market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and
companies look to tap the appetite for climate-friendly
investments.
    The issue comes a day after Ireland set its budget for 2019,
which aims to balance the state's books for the first time in
more than a decade and showed the national debt would continue
to fall as a percentage of national income. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    ""The timing and the fiscal backdrop could hardly be better
for the Irish DMO (debt management office). Yesterday's budget
highlighted the current strength of Ireland's economic/fiscal
position,"" said Ryan McGrath, head of fixed income strategy and
sales at Cantor Fitzgerald.
    The reference to the green bond in Finance Minister Paschal
Donohoe's budget speech was also important, McGrath said, as
cross government departmental support is needed for successful
green bond issuance.
    Government representatives joined the country's debt agency
in roadshows held around Europe to brief investors, a source
told Reuters last week. [nL8N1WH5UO]
    The sale also allows the debt agency to meet a long stated
aim of diversifying away from standard bonds and will see it
pass its minimum funding needs for the year, having so far
raised 13.5 billion euros of a 14 to 18 billion euro target.
    Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Danske Bank, HSBC and J.P.
Morgan are joint lead managers for the deal.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Programmes run by some European
Union countries to sell passports and residency permits to
wealthy foreign citizens pose risks of money laundering as some
of the schemes are not properly managed, campaign groups said on
Wednesday.
    Government schemes to trade citizenship or residence rights
for large investment are currently applied in 13 EU countries:
Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Greece, Latvia, Portugal,

dubious means, securing a new place to call home far away from

Naomi Hirst of rights group Global Witness said.
    She said checks on individuals that bought EU citizenship or
residency permits were not satisfactory and exposed countries to
corruption and money laundering risks.
    The joint report by Global Witness and Transparency
International urged the European Union to set standards for
managing the schemes and to extend anti-money laundering rules,
applied so far to banks or gaming firms, to all those involved
in the visa-for-sale industry.

    By Richard Lough and Marine Pennetier
    PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron
postponed a planned reshuffle of his government on Wednesday,
prompting new questions about his ability to keep his
administration on track after several resignations and a slump
in popularity.
    The president and his prime minister have been weighing the
reshuffle for a week following the departure of three ministers
since late August, resignations that have challenged Macron's
authority and stalled his reform ambitions.
    The 40-year-old faces many difficulties in carrying out a
significant revamp. Not only must he try to maintain the
left-right balance that he made a hallmark of his centrist
movement, but he must find strong candidates from among a
relatively shallow and inexperienced pool of loyalists.      
    ""The president wishes to take all the time necessary to draw
up a team in a calm and professional way,"" an Elysee official
said.
    Macron's aim was to build a ""skilled and coherent team"" to
serve the French people, he said.
    Ministers had expected the rejig before a cabinet meeting on
Wednesday morning. But in the event, the Elysee said it would
not happen until after Macron returns from a visit to Armenia
late on Friday evening, which is an unlikely moment for a
reshuffle.
    Macron's popularity has sunk in recent months, falling to
below 30 percent, as voters express frustration with a leader
they often regard as arrogant and see as supportive of policies
that benefit the wealthy. Impatience has also grown with the
sluggish pace of economic growth and job creation.
    Allies have downplayed any sense of crisis inside the
administration, saying that even with a reshuffle, there will be
no overall shift in policy.
    ""There is in this majority, in this government, no anxiety,
no restlessness,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told lawmakers
during a weekly question and answer session on Tuesday. 
    ""There is a will to stand firm on the commitments made by
the president.""
    Macron and his closest advisers have pushed back against the
growing criticism of his administration, saying they are
determined to implement social and economic reforms over the
course of his five-year mandate, come what may.
    
    WEAKENED PULLING-POWER
    In winning power in May 2017, Macron and his En Marche
movement demolished France's traditional mainstream parties. In
the wake of his victory, he poached skilled, senior politicians
from both poles to build a government that he described as
""neither of the right nor left"".
    But as the luster has worn off his 17-month-old presidency,
and the impact of early reforms to the labour code and tax rules
have yet to filter through, rivals have sought to depict an
increasingly isolated leader with diminished pulling power.
    ""Macron's ability to attract is pretty weak,"" hard left
lawmaker Alexis Corbiere told BFM TV. ""Many are asking
themselves: 'what should we do in this mess?' They don't want to
be finished politically by becoming a minister in a government
that risks descending into crisis in less than a year.""
    Le Figaro quoted Socialist senator Rachid Temal as saying:
""The fact the president has been bogged down by this for a week
underlines his weakness on the reserves bench.""       
    While Macron's popularity has fallen, he does not face any
challenge to his leadership. His Republique En Marche party
holds a commanding majority in the lower house National
Assembly, and his presidential term does not expire until 2022. 
    Even so, European elections in 2019 and nationwide municipal
polls in 2020 could turn into a semi-referendum on his mid-term
performance, further setting back his reform agenda. Despite
that threat, loyalists are maintaining a firm line.
    ""There will be no change in policy direction,"" Richard

agreed on Wednesday to distribute 6.85 billion euros ($7.87
billion) to its regions next year to help them cover the costs
of housing and integrating migrants, a government source told
Reuters.
    Germany is trying to integrate over a million migrants and
refugees who entered in 2015-2016 after Chancellor Angela Merkel
opened its borders, an unpopular decision that catapulted the
anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the lower
house of parliament after elections last year.
    Merkel's government acted ahead of Sunday's election in the
affluent state of Bavaria, where a backlash over migration is
threatening the longtime hold on power of the conservative
Christian Social Union (CSU), Merkel's federal coalition ally.
    Legislation drafted by Merkel's Finance Ministry for migrant
aid to federal states in 2019 includes 2.44 billion euros for
integration including German-language classes, 1.8 billion euros
for accommodation benefits and 500 million for social housing
subsidies, the source said. 
    It provides for a total 15 billion euros to be paid out to
states and communes for assisting migrants through 2022.
    Germany's states also received one-off federal cash
infusions to cover migration-related costs during the height of
the influx by mainly Muslim migrants in 2015 and 2016.

    By Teis Jensen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Danish and Estonian
regulators have not sought assistance from Moscow in their
investigation of a massive money laundering scandal involving
Russian and other account holders, Russia's financial monitoring
service told Reuters on Wednesday.
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
transactions processed by Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the Danish
lender said last month it thinks are suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    ""As of today, we have not received any official request from
Estonian or Danish law enforcement agencies or financial
intelligence units (for) assistance within the existing
international agreements and obligations,"" Rosfinmonitoring said
in an email reply to questions from Reuters.
    Some 23 percent of the incoming funds in the Estonian
non-resident portfolio, the centre of the scandal, came from
Russia, Danske Bank said in its report last month.
    ""It is really criticisable that the Danish authorities did
not reach out to the Russians. It would have been very relevant
to ask them, to find out: where does the money come from,"" Jakob
Dedenroth Bernhoft, a Copenhagen-based expert on anti money
laundering, told Reuters.
    Rosfinmonitoring is unconditionally ready to assist ""in
counteracting laundering of the proceeds of crimes, provided we
receive such requests via the official channels,"" the watchdog
said in its email.
    It also said Russian authorities as far back as 2007
notified the Estonian authorities about the Danske Bank branch's
""improper behavior and its involvement in suspicious transit
operations"".
    Danske Bank's report concluded the bank had failed to take
proper action in 2007 when it was criticised by the Estonian
regulator. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov, in a written answer
to a question from another lawmaker, said on Wednesday the
country's finance watchdog had put too much trust in information
provided by Danske Bank and should have been more critical. 
    Jarlov will be quizzed at an open hearing in the Danish
parliament on Wednesday.
    Denmark's financial services authority did not immediately
reply to a request for comment.

    * Bond deal follows budget that showed strong fiscal picture

 (Adds update on pricing, order book)
    DUBLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Ireland won big demand on
Wednesday for a 12-year ""green bond"" to raise capital for
projects with environmental benefits and a source said it was
likely to raise between 2 and 3 billion euros.
    It joins a small number of EU countries including France,
Belgium and Poland in entering an increasingly popular market
that earmarks proceeds for specific environmentally friendly
projects or initiatives that blunt the impact of climate change.
    Ireland had received over 9.5 billion euros worth of
investor orders for the new paper by 0900 GMT, lead bankers for
the deal said, helping to tighten the price from 15 to 13 basis
points over mid-swaps that implied a yield of around 1.36
percent.
    Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall
bond market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and
companies look to tap the appetite for climate-friendly
investments.
    The issue comes a day after Ireland set its budget for 2019,
which aims to balance the state's books for the first time in
more than a decade and showed the national debt would continue
to fall as a percentage of national income. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    ""The timing and the fiscal backdrop could hardly be better
for the Irish DMO (debt management office). Yesterday's budget
highlighted the current strength of Ireland's economic/fiscal
position,"" said Ryan McGrath, head of fixed income strategy and
sales at Cantor Fitzgerald.
    The reference to the green bond in Finance Minister Paschal
Donohoe's budget speech was also important, McGrath said, as
cross government departmental support is needed for successful
green bond issuance.
    Government representatives joined the country's debt agency
in roadshows held around Europe to brief investors, a source
told Reuters last week. [nL8N1WH5UO]
    The sale also allows the debt agency to meet a long stated
aim of diversifying away from standard bonds and will see it
pass its minimum funding needs for the year, having so far
raised 13.5 billion euros of a 14 to 18 billion euro target.
    Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Danske Bank, HSBC and J.P.
Morgan are joint lead managers for the deal.

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Union's Brexit
negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday called for ""decisive
progress"" in negotiations with Britain in time for a summit of
all 28 EU nation leaders next week. 
    Brexit negotiators from both sides have been locked in
intense discussions this week, trying to overcome differences on
the biggest outstanding hurdle to a Brexit deal - how to keep
the Ireland-UK border open after Britain leaves the bloc in
March.
    Speaking after Barnier briefed the executive European
Commission, spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news conference:
""He recalled that decisive progress must be made in time for the
October European Council next week and negotiations at the
technical level will continue this week.""
    The 27 EU states will get an update at a meeting of 
national ambassadors, without Britain, on Friday evening. The
sides will continue negotiations through the weekend with hopes
for a breakthrough as early as Monday. 
    The 27 EU leaders meeting next Wednesday and Thursday in
Brussels want to be able to announce decisive progress on the
Brexit deal to agree to hold another summit in November. That
would be to finalise work on a declaration of close future ties
with Britain that would also be part of the Brexit package.
    ""Michel Barnier and his team are working day and night to
reach a deal, but we are not there yet,"" EU Migration
Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told the news conference.
    In a sign of progress, diplomats in Brussels told Reuters
the European Union no longer expected a new proposal from
Britain for the Ireland-UK border fix after Brexit as
negotiators from both sides were seeking to agree on it in
direct talks.
    Previously, the 27 states who will remain in the bloc
insisted that London present formal new proposals for the border
in writing.
    The issue of how to avoid extensive checks at the border
between EU state Ireland and the British province of Northern
Ireland - Britain's only land frontier - after Brexit is the
last remaining hurdle, with nearly everything else in the
withdrawal agreement agreed before Britain leaves next March. 
    
    NO-DEAL
    Both the EU and Britain have signalled progress in recent
days, boosting the sentiment in markets, which fear the most
damaging no-deal Brexit.
    ""My feeling is that there is a smaller probability for lack
of deal now than we have had for some time,"" Danuta Hubner, a
European Parliament lawmaker dealing with Brexit, told a
committee.
    But the Commission has also looked at preparations among the
27 states for a no-deal scenario on Wednesday, discussing a
document laying out the multiple disruptions that would ensue,
including customs checks and duties kicking in immediately on
all imports and exports between the EU and Britain. 
    While some in the Commission wanted to publish the document,
the Brexit negotiators feared it would upset Britain and could
hurt the negotiations.
    ""We are working hard for the Brexit negotiations to succeed.
But since we can't guarantee the result right now, we have to
prepare for all possible outcomes,"" one diplomat said. 
    ""There is a growing sense among the EU27 that outstanding
preparedness questions have to be addressed very quickly and in
a detailed way... The EU27 need to be ready on day one to
address issues like citizen's rights, transport or customs
coherently.""
    Avramopoulos also said the bloc's no-deal contingency plans
on security were driven by ""goodwill"", stressing the bloc would
want to continue cooperating with Britain closely, including on
sharing intelligence. [nB5N1U7039]

    * Campaigners urge extension of anti-money laundering rules
    * Lawmaker demands end of sales of visas, passports

 (Recasts with Commission, MEP reaction)
    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on
Wednesday it will provide guidance to EU states on how to manage
national schemes to sell passports and residency permits to
wealthy foreign citizens, as campaigners and lawmakers warned of
money laundering risks.
    Government schemes to trade citizenship or residence rights
for large investment are currently applied in 13 EU countries:
Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Greece, Latvia, Portugal,
Spain, Ireland, Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and France.
Hungary has terminated its programme.
    ""If you have a lot of money that you acquired through
dubious means, securing a new place to call home far away from
the place you stole from isn't just appealing, it's sensible,""
Naomi Hirst of rights group Global Witness said.
    She said checks on individuals that bought EU citizenship or
residency permits were not satisfactory and exposed countries to
corruption and money laundering risks.
    The joint report by Global Witness and Transparency
International urged the European Union to set standards for
managing the schemes and to extend anti-money laundering rules,
applied so far to banks or gaming firms, to all those involved
in the visa-for-sale industry.
    The European Commission will publish a report on schemes in
EU countries by the end of the year, commissioner Dimitris
Avramopoulos said on Wednesday. He said the report would offer
guidance to member states on managing the programmes, ""including
on necessary background checks for applicants"".  
    Acquiring these documents costs on average 900,000 euros,
but Cyprus' passport could cost up to 2 millions, the report
said. 
    Cyprus has raised 4.8 billion euros ($5.51 billion) from its
scheme, while Portugal could earn nearly a billion euros a year,
according to figures cited in the report, called ""European
Getaway – Inside the Murky World of Golden Visas"".
    EU states generated around 25 billion euros in foreign
direct investment in a decade from selling at least 6,000
passports and nearly 100,000 residency permits, the report said
using what it called conservative estimates.
    ""Money must not be the criterion for citizens' and
residents' rights in the EU,"" said EU lawmaker Sven Giegold, who
sits on the assembly's special committee on financial crimes.
    ""The trade in passports and visas by EU states must be
stopped as soon as possible. These programmes are a gateway to
criminal money,"" he added, echoing the view of other EU
lawmakers.
    The report said in Malta, which has raised 718 million euros
from its scheme, applicants who have criminal records or are
under investigation could still be considered eligible ""in
special circumstances"". 
    ""Poorly managed schemes allow corrupt individuals to work
and travel unhindered throughout the EU and undermine our
collective security,"" Laure Brillaud, anti-money laundering
expert at Transparency International, said.
    All the countries who run these schemes, except Britain,
Cyprus, Ireland and Bulgaria, are part of the Schengen
free-movement area which comprises 26 European states.

    It received over 11.25 billion euros worth of investor
orders for the new paper, setting a price of 12 basis points
over mid-swaps which implied a yield of around 1.36 percent.

    By Richard Lough and Michel Rose
    PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
postponed a planned government reshuffle on Wednesday, prompting
new questions about the depth of political experience in his
party and his own ability to keep his administration on track
after several resignations.
    The president and his prime minister have been weighing the
reshuffle for a week following the departure of three ministers
since late August, resignations that have challenged Macron's
authority and stalled his reform ambitions.
    The 40-year-old faces multiple challenges in carrying out a
significant revamp. Not only must he try to maintain the
left-right balance that he made a hallmark of his centrist
movement, but he must find strong candidates from among a
relatively shallow and inexperienced pool of loyalists.      
    ""The president wishes to take all the time necessary to draw
up a team in a calm and professional way,"" the Elysee Palace
said. 
    Ministers had expected the rejig before a cabinet meeting on
Wednesday morning. But in the event, the Elysee said it would
not happen until after Macron returns from a visit to Armenia
late on Friday.
    Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire cancelled travelling to Bali
for an International Monetary Fund gathering to attend the
cabinet session.
    Macron's popularity has sunk in recent months, falling to
below 30 percent, as voters express frustration with a leader
they often regard as arrogant and supportive of policies that
benefit the wealthy. Impatience has also grown with the sluggish
pace of economic growth and job creation.
    Opponents branded the reshuffle a ""tragic-comedy"" that
exposed a shortage of political experience in the ruling party.
    Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told baying opposition
lawmakers there was ""no anxiety, no restlessness"" inside an
administration committed to social and economic reform. Tough
policy reform to pensions and unemployment benefits loom.   
    A senior Elysee official dismissed reports of a rift between
Macron and Philippe. 
    It was because Macron had reshaped the political landscape
and brought in faces from outside politics that the process took
longer, the official said.
    ""We're no longer in an age where because someone has 15
years of service under their belt they deserve to become a
minister,"" the official said. 
    
    DIMINISHED PULLING-POWER
    Macron's rivals were not convinced.
    ""Macron's ability to attract is pretty weak,"" hard left
lawmaker Alexis Corbiere told BFM TV. ""Many are asking
themselves: 'what should we do in this mess?' They don't want to
be finished politically by becoming a minister in a government
that risks descending into crisis in less than a year.""
    In winning power in May 2017, Macron and his En Marche
movement demolished France's traditional mainstream parties. He
went on to poach skilled, senior politicians from both poles and
draft in newcomers to build a government ""neither of the right
nor left"".
    But as the lustre has worn off his 17-month-old presidency,
and the impact of early reforms to the labour code and tax rules
have yet to filter through, rivals have sought to depict an
increasingly isolated leader with diminished pulling power.
    Le Figaro quoted Socialist senator Rachid Temal as saying:
""The fact the president has been bogged down by this for a week
underlines his weakness on the reserves bench.""       
    But his Republique En Marche party holds a commanding
majority in the lower house National Assembly. His presidential
term does not expire until 2022. 
    Even so, European elections in 2019 and nationwide municipal
polls in 2020 could turn into a semi-referendum on his mid-term
performance, further setting back his reform agenda.
    Particularly damaging to Macron have been Collomb's
criticisms that he lacks ""humility"" - a view which opinion polls
show is shared by voters.
    ""The issue here is not the government but the president, a
president who is seen by French people as someone who doesn't
listen to them, and even belittles them,"" said Jean-Daniel Levy
of pollster Harris Interactive. 
    ""They want fairer policies from the president.""

    * Leaders of coalition parties say they will not backtrack

 (Adds Tria comment on market confidence)
    By Giuseppe Fonte and Steve Scherer
    ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Italy's ruling coalition said on
Wednesday it would not ""backtrack"" on plans to increase deficit
spending, digging in against financial market and EU pressure
and brushing off criticism from parliament's budgetary office.
    The budgetary office, a non-partisan body tasked with
verifying budget sums, refused on Tuesday to validate the
government's multi-year plan, saying it used forecasts for
economic growth that were too optimistic.
    The parliamentary budget office opinion is not binding, but
its rejection of the growth forecasts forced Economy Minister
Giovanni Tria to return to parliament for a second straight day
to explain.
    Tria, struggling to impose his views as a moderating
influence on fiscal matters within the cabinet, [nL8N1WP2GM]
told parliament the government stood by its forecasts.
    Investors have responded to the budget plan by selling
Italian debt, raising the cost of borrowing and hurting banks
that have large holdings of government bonds.
    ""The rise of yields on state bonds recorded in the past few
days is certainly worrying, but I want to repeat that it's an
excessive reaction that isn't justified by Italy's economic
fundamentals,"" said Tria.
    ""This budget doesn't put into discussion the sustainability
of the debt. It's clear that a government must try to recover
confidence and it will do all it can to recover confidence,""
Tria added. Bond yields declined slightly on Wednesday after his
remarks. [nL8N1WQ22W]
    The leaders of both coalition parties repeated that they
would not give in to pressure. On RAI state radio,
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio said he
would not ""betray"" Italians by changing the budget plan.
    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini, speaking on RAI
state TV, warned ""speculators"" against betting that the
government would climb down.
    Salvini said ""a few big financial institutions"" are ""betting
that Italy will backtrack (on the budget). They're wrong.""
    Tria said deficit spending would be worth 22 billion euros
next year with the budget including 15 billion euros ($17.2
billion) in cuts and extra revenue to cover 37 billion in total
additional spending.
    The government, which took office in June, has fixed next
year's deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP),
three times the forecast of the previous centre-left
administration. Economic growth is seen at 1.5 percent next
year, 1.6 percent in 2020, and 1.4 percent in 2021.

 (Recasts on size of deal)
    By Padraic Halpin
    DUBLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Ireland raised 3 billion euros
from the sale of a 12-year ""green bond"" on Wednesday, its first
time tapping an increasing popular market that raises capital
for projects with environmental benefits.
    It received over 11.25 billion euros ($12.94 billion) of
orders, a lead banker on the deal said, helping to tighten the
price from 15 to 13 basis points over mid-swaps, implying a
yield of around 1.36 percent.
    Ireland joins a small number of EU countries including
France, Belgium and Poland in entering the growing market that
earmarks proceeds for environmentally friendly projects or
initiatives that blunt the impact of climate change.
    Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall
bond market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and
companies look to tap appetite for such investments.
    On Tuesday, Ireland set its budget for 2019, which aims to
balance the state's books for the first time in more than a
decade and showed the national debt would continue to fall as a
percentage of national income. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    ""The timing and the fiscal backdrop could hardly be better
for the Irish DMO (debt management office). Yesterday's budget
highlighted the current strength of Ireland's economic/fiscal
position,"" said Ryan McGrath, head of fixed income strategy and
sales at Cantor Fitzgerald.
    The reference to the green bond in Finance Minister Paschal
Donohoe's budget speech was also important, McGrath said, as
cross government departmental support is needed for successful
green bond issuance.
    Government representatives joined the country's debt agency
in roadshows held around Europe to brief investors, a source
told Reuters last week. [nL8N1WH5UO]
    The sale also allows the debt agency to meet a long-stated
aim of diversifying away from standard bonds and saw it pass its
minimum funding needs for the year, having previously raised
13.5 billion euros of a 14 to 18 billion euro target.
    Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Danske Bank, HSBC and J.P.
Morgan were joint lead managers for the deal.

newcomers to build a government ""neither of the right nor left"".
    But as the lustre has worn off his young presidency, and the
impact of early reforms to the labour code and tax rules have
yet to filter through, rivals have sought to depict an
increasingly isolated figure with diminished star power.
    Le Figaro quoted Socialist senator Rachid Temal as saying:
""The fact the president has been bogged down by this for a week
underlines his weakness on the reserves bench.""       
    While Macron doesn't face reelection until 2022, European
Parliament elections in May next year and municipal polls in
France in 2020 could turn into a semi-referendum on his mid-term
performance, setting his reform agenda back further.
    Particularly damaging to Macron in recent weeks were
comments made by ex-interior minister Collomb. 
    A wily ex-mayor of Lyon from the Socialist party, Collomb
was an early convert to Macronism. But before pushing to step
down and return to regional politics, Collomb acknowledged
Macron and his team ""lacked humility"" and warned of hubris - a
view which opinion polls show is shared by voters. 
    ""The issue here is not the government but the president, a
president who is seen by French people as someone who doesn't
listen to them, and even belittles them,"" said Jean-Daniel Levy
of pollster Harris Interactive. 
    ""They want fairer policies from the president.""

    By George Hay
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Louis Dreyfus
Company [AKIRAU.UL] is demonstrating the pitfalls of being
private. The unlisted French commodity trader this week unveiled
its biannual peek into how its business of dealing in soybeans,
grain and cotton is faring. Not amazingly well, is the answer.
But that’s not the only problem.
    Louis Dreyfus is the D in the ABCD short-hand used for the
commodity trading club that also includes Archer Daniels Midland
<ADM.N>, Bunge <BG.N> and Cargill [CARG.UL]. While all exploit
pricing differences around the world and manage supply chains,
they are quite different. Cargill’s $115 billion of revenue in
the year to May 31 were almost double ADM’s last full-year
revenue and well over twice those of Bunge and Louis Dreyfus.
ADM and Bunge are also listed, while the other two are private.
    Cargill and Louis Dreyfus have encountered contrasting
operating fortunes. Cargill’s net profit of $3.1 billion in the
year ending May 31 was up 9 percent from a year earlier, while
the one reported on Monday by its smaller peer was down by a
third, to $100 million. But Cargill paid $551 million, less than
a fifth of its net profit, in dividends to the eponymous family
that hold its shares, according to the FT. Its French rival, by
contrast, is paying shareholders $411 million – twice annualised
first-half net profit. That is helpful for Margarita
Louis-Dreyfus, who owns four-fifths, and has to raise around
$800 million to buy shares held by the Louis Dreyfus family
later this year.
    The problem is the company’s net debt leapt by $1 billion in
the first half, to $3.6 billion – 75 percent of equity, instead
of 50 percent as in December – while financing costs jumped by
over a half to $142 million year-on-year. The company is also
lending another $1 billion to its own holding company to help
recapitalise Louis Dreyfus’s ailing Biosev subsidiary. And
there’s no public share price to react negatively to the news.
    The commodity trader has denied that the departures of its
chief executive and chief financial officer last month were
related to financial matters. That may be true. Dreyfus’
first-half results were mainly dented by mark-to-market losses
caused by hedging snafus, which the company says will reverse in
the second half of 2018. But given the equity is being stripped
back at a time when trade wars present challenges to its core
soybean business, they picked a good time to leave. 
    On Twitter https://twitter.com/gfhay
    
    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Louis Dreyfus Company said on Oct. 8 that a $65 million
hit linked to hedging of soybean crushing margins had
contributed to the decline in group net profit in the first half
of 2018, to $100 million from $160 million in the same period a
year earlier.
    - The company said the hedging would ensure ""a high return
from our crushing activities for the whole of 2018"" and, echoing
comments made in September by new Chief Executive Ian McIntosh,
added that it was expecting a decent year.
    - The Oct. 8 statement showed that the operating company
lent $1 billion to its holding company, mostly related to
Brazilian sugar unit Biosev, through a loan due to mature in
2023. It also reported a $411 million dividend awarded to
investors, including controlling shareholder Margarita
Louis-Dreyfus.

French President Emmanuel Macron will be introduced in 2025, but
workers will retain benefits already accrued under the existing
system, said the man liaising between government and unions over
the reform. 
    A trade union leader and business lobby group representative
said they understood it would take 40 years for the new system
to be fully phased in.
    The government wants to align the retirement systems in the
public and private sectors as well as the variety of different
pension set-ups for different professions.
    The new single system would use points so that each euro
paid in would give the same retirement benefits no matter what
sector pensioners worked in.
    Currently, retirement benefits are based on a worker's
salary during the last six months before retirement in the
public sector and the average during the last 25 years in the
private sector.
    ""The implementation of a new, universal system is a response
to the fragility of our current system,"" Jean-Paul Delevoye,
Macron's middleman, told a meeting with labour unions and
business representatives.
    Officials have said France's legal retirement age will
remain 62.
    A decade ago, more than a million people took to the streets
in protest against pension reform. France's more hardline unions
have warned of a repeat if the upcoming changes are not to their
liking.
    ""We think this proposal will lower pensioners' standard of
living to near the poverty threshold,"" said Catherine Perret, a
negotiator for the militant CGT union.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 10: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Italian insurer 
Societa Reale Mutua di Assicurazioni's (Reale Mutua) and core Spanish subsidiary 
Reale Seguros Generales's (Reale Seguros) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) 
Ratings at 'BBB+' (Good). The Outlooks are Negative.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The ratings are influenced by Italy's sovereign rating of 'BBB'/Negative through 
the insurer's exposure to Italian-based debt securities, which is reflected in 
our view of the group's investment and asset risk. To back domestic liabilities 
Reale Mutua held EUR4.7 billion of Italian sovereign bonds at end-2017 (2x 
consolidated shareholders' funds). 

The affirmation of Reale Mutua's ratings reflects the group's very strong 
capitalisation, as measured by Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model (Prism 
FBM), and its strong business profile. The Negative Outlook on Reale Mutua's 
ratings reflects the Outlook on Italy's sovereign rating.

The group's exposure to Italian sovereign debt is reflected also in the 
sovereign constraint on Reale Mutua's ratings at 'BBB+'. This is one notch above 
the sovereign rating, in recognition of Reale Mutua's strong credit profile and 
international diversification into Spain (A-/Stable), where the group sources 
around 20% of its net premiums. Reale Mutua is steadily reducing the weight of 
Italian government bonds in its portfolio.

Reale Mutua's Prism FBM score was 'Very Strong' based on end-2017 financials, in 
line with 2016's. The group's consolidated Solvency II (S2) ratio, calculated 
according to the group's partial internal model, stood at 271% at end-1H18 (272% 
at end-2017). It underpins the insurer's high level of capitalisation. Reale 
Mutua has not yet achieved regulatory approval to deploy the internal model for 
the life business. Fitch expects the S2 ratio to improve further once Reale 
Mutua is allowed to apply the internal model to its life business. Reale Mutua 
has no financial leverage, which is positive for its ratings.

Reale Mutua's consolidated reported non-life combined ratio improved to 95% in 
1H18 (1H17: 98%), as profitability improved on both motor and non-motor 
businesses. Its 2013-2017 average combined ratio was very strong at 96%. Reale 
Mutua's average Fitch-calculated return on equity for 2013-2017 was 6%, which 
Fitch views as strong, given the group's mutual status. Fitch expects Reale 
Mutua to maintain a very strong non-life combined ratio and strong net 
profitability in 2018.

Reale Mutua has a strong business profile. Its market position in Italy 
strengthened following the acquisition of Uniqa Italy. The group is growing its 
presence in Spain, through Reale Seguros (non-life) and Reale Vida (life), and 
in Chile as part of its geographical diversification strategy. Reale Seguros 
contributes strongly to the group's earnings, is viewed as a 'core' entity of 
Reale Mutua under Fitch's insurance group rating methodology and is rated 
accordingly, based on the credit profile of the Reale Mutua group as a whole.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Reale Mutua's ratings will likely be downgraded if Italy's sovereign rating is 
downgraded. The Outlooks will be revised to Stable if Italy's Outlook is revised 
to Stable.

On 4 October 2018, Fitch published an exposure draft of its global master 
criteria for rating insurance companies, titled 'Exposure Draft: Insurance 
Rating Criteria'. The primary change aims to create a more fundamental approach 
to capturing country risk within ratings. To accomplish this, Fitch proposes to 
eliminate the current ""top-down"" sovereign rating constraint and substitute it 
with an enhanced ""bottom-up"" analysis of country risks. Fitch's adoption of the 
proposed criteria, as per the Exposure Draft, would likely result in a one-notch 
upgrade of Reale Mutua's IFS Ratings to 'A-'.

    By Richard Lough and Michel Rose
    PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
put off a government reshuffle on Wednesday, raising new
questions about the depth of political experience in his party
and his own ability to keep his administration on track after
several resignations.
    The president and his prime minister have been weighing the
reshuffle for a week following the departure of three ministers
since late August, including interior minister and early Macron
backer Gerard Collomb. The resignations have challenged the
president's authority and stalled his reform ambitions.
    Macron, 40, faces multiple challenges in carrying out a
significant revamp. Not only must he try to maintain the
left-right balance that he made a hallmark of his centrist
movement, but also find strong candidates from among a
relatively shallow and inexperienced pool of loyalists.      
    ""The president wishes to take all the time necessary to draw
up a team in a calm and professional way,"" the Elysee Palace
said in a statement announcing the reshuffle's delay.
    Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, a member of Macron's
inner circle, denied the Macron administration was in disarray. 
    ""There is no division in the government or the parliamentary
majority on the political line we are pursuing,"" he said.
    Ministers had been expecting the rejig before a cabinet
meeting on Wednesday morning. But in the event, the Elysee said
it would not happen until after Macron returns from a visit to
Armenia late on Friday. 
    Macron's popularity has sunk in recent months as frustration
has welled up over a leader many voters see as arrogant and the
architect of policies that favour the wealthy.     
    Opponents branded the reshuffle a ""tragi-comedy"" that
exposed a shortage of political experience in the ruling party.
    Macron's Republique En Marche party, though, holds a
commanding majority in the National Assembly (lower house), his
presidential term runs until 2022, and the opposition is
divided, meaning he faces no immediate threat. 
    Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told baying opposition
lawmakers there was ""no anxiety, no restlessness"" inside an
administration committed to social and economic reform including
an overhaul of the pension and unemployment benefit systems.
    A senior Elysee official said the reshuffle process was
taking longer than expected because Macron had redrawn the
political landscape and brought in faces from outside politics.
    ""We're no longer in an age where because someone has 15
years of service under their belt they deserve to become a
minister,"" the official said. 
    
    DIMINISHED PULLING POWER
    Macron's rivals are not convinced.
    ""Macron's ability to attract is pretty weak,"" hard left
lawmaker Alexis Corbiere told BFM TV. ""Many are asking
themselves: 'What should we do in this mess?' They don't want to
be finished politically by becoming a minister in a government
that risks descending into crisis in less than a year.""
    In winning power in May 2017, Macron and his En Marche
movement demolished France's traditional mainstream parties. He
went on to poach senior politicians from both poles and draft in
newcomers to build a government ""neither of the right nor left"".
    But as the lustre has worn off his young presidency, and the
impact of early reforms to the labour code and tax rules have
yet to filter through, rivals have sought to depict an
increasingly isolated figure with diminished star power.
    ""That they cannot replace the interior minister highlights
chaos inside the Macron administration,"" said Valerie Boyer of
the centre-right Les Republicains party. ""Either there's a lack
of names or a lack of candidates in whom the president can trust
and who will stay loyal to his programme.""
    While Macron doesn't face re-election until 2022, European
Parliament elections in May next year and municipal voting in
France in 2020 could turn into a semi-referendum on his mid-term
performance.
    Particularly damaging to Macron in recent weeks were
comments made by ex-interior minister Collomb. An early convert
to Macronism, Collomb said the president and his team ""lacked
humility"" and warned of hubris - a viewpoint which opinion polls
show is shared by many voters. 
    ""The issue here is not the government but the president, a
president who is seen by French people as someone who doesn't
listen to them, and even belittles them,"" said Jean-Daniel Levy
of pollster Harris Interactive.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A Brexit deal is ""within reach""
next week, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday, even
as he rammed home his insistence that Britain must accept
possible checks on trade between its mainland and Northern
Ireland.
    ""An agreement is within reach for Oct. 17, next Wednesday,
if we succeed to the end of this negotiation now,"" Barnier said
in a speech to business leaders at the European Parliament.
    EU leaders are due to meet for dinner in Brussels next
Wednesday and hope to agree a withdrawal treaty with Britain
that Barnier said was 80-85 percent ready but on which obstacles
remain, notably on how to keep the new EU-UK land border with
Northern Ireland from reviving conflict in the British province.
    The European Union is doing all it can to ensure checks on
goods moving across Northern Ireland's borders would be made ""in
the least intrusive way possible"", for example on ferries, at
ports or in factories of origin, he said. But veterinary and
food security controls will have to take place at the border. 
    Barnier said Brexit would trigger the need for customs, VAT
and compliance checks with EU standards between Ireland and
Northern Ireland in the event that a planned ""backstop"" were
triggered because a future EU-UK trade deal was not sufficient
in itself to ensure the land frontier was not a ""hard border"". 
    For customs and VAT, Barnier said, ""we propose using the
existing customs procedures to avoid doing checks at the transit
points"". He said customs declarations could be done online in
advance.
    ""The only visible systematic checks between Northern Ireland
and the rest of the UK would involve scanning the bar codes on
lorries or containers, which should be done on ferries or in
transit ports.""
    For industrial goods, he said it could be done by ""market
surveil;ance authorities"", on-site in the companies. But he said
checks of animals and animal-derived products would still have
to take place on the border and cover all of that trade.
    ""Our challenge is to make sure that these procedures are as
easy as possible and not burdensome, particularly for small and
medium businness,"" he said in a speech that ended with a
standing ovation.
    The British government and leading politicians in Northern
Ireland insist they will not agree to a withdrawal treaty that
foresees the possibility of Northern Ireland being kept inside
the EU's economic area while the British mainland is not.

    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Ukraine should have its first
low-cost airlines flying domestic routes by the end of the year
and is also putting a handful of contracts to run airports up
for sale, the country's infrastructure minister said on
Wednesday.
    Ireland's Ryanair <RYA.I> launched its first routes to
Ukraine this year and Volodymyr Omelyan, the minister who helped
revive the deal after vested interests had threatened to torpedo
it, is now working on the domestic market. [nL8N1R51XI]  
    ""We have a new operation SkyUp starting its operations and
will get regular routes by the end of the year,"" said Omelyan,
who was attending an investment conference in London.
    ""And I hope also by the end of this year, we will have
another domestic company established in Kherson in south
Ukraine.""
    Omelyan is currently facing an investigation by Ukraine's 
National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) but has refused to
resign, criticising the probe, which is into his finances, as
politically motivated. [nL5N1VZ2GV] 
    ""The only goal is to ruin my reputation and stop me doing
reforms.""
    On his next plans to open up Ukraine's aviation sector, he
said Ryanair's scale may put off other pan-European airlines but
he said there were talks with others from Asia looking to bring
in tourists from India and China.
    Omelyan declined to name them for commercial reasons but on
the timing said it would be, ""most likely next year, we are
already in discussions with them.""
    Since 2016 passenger numbers in Ukraine have been growing
around 30 percent a year and Kiev wants to quadruple the number
of airports in the country over the next 12 years as part of a
$60 billion infrastructure drive.
    As well as bringing in new airlines, Kiev is also ready to
offer out contracts to run a handful of its existing regional
airports.
    ""I hope we will be ready to present to the market at least
concessions of 3-5 airports early next year,"" he added.
    Turning to the country's state-run rail system, Omelyan said
there were plans to open up parts of it, such as cargo freight
and longer distance passenger trains, to private operators too.
A pilot scheme for freight is scheduled for next year.
    Ukraine railways still has a number of serious governance
and transparency issues but it now has a positive cash flow and
has made a major pledge to invest in its rolling stock.
    As a result, it is now edging towards the sale of a
Eurobond, although Omelyan did not say how much it would be.
    ""They are very close to that decision. They are totally
independent.""

 (Adds quotes from funding chief)
    By Padraic Halpin
    DUBLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Ireland raised 3 billion euros
from the sale of a 12-year green bond on Wednesday, the first of
a planned series of forays into a market that raises capital for
projects with environmental benefits.
    Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall
bond market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and
companies look to tap into increasing investor appetite for the
product. Ireland received over 11.25 billion euros ($12.94
billion) of orders and sold the debt at a yield of 1.4 percent.
    It joins a small number of EU countries including France,
Belgium and Poland in diversifying into the market that earmarks
proceeds for environmentally friendly projects or initiatives
that blunt the impact of climate change.
    ""I felt on the road that there was a lack of supply in the
sovereign space and I very much got the feeling that green is
becoming very, very important,"" Frank O'Connor, the Irish debt
agency's head of funding, told reporters on a conference call.
    ""We have seen brand new accounts we haven't seen in our
previous syndications.""
    Without entering the green market, O'Connor said Ireland
risked being left to chase a smaller pool of capital that could
cost it more in the long run.
    Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas
Asset Management, which participated in the deal, said the
company was among those keen to invest in green bonds. 
    ""We are looking to add new names. We see more and more
interest from our clients for this product and we like Ireland's
overall profile from a financial point,"" he said.
    The successful debut will encourage Ireland to auction at
least another 1 billion euros of the new bond next year and
possibly add a second green bond, on top of diversifying into
inflation and dollar issues over the coming years, O'Connor
said.
    Ireland could comfortably allocate half of the funds raised
on Wednesday towards the 1.8 billion of eligible green projects
in the works this year, he added, freeing it up to raise more
cash for future projects.
    The deal came after Ireland on Tuesday said its 2019 budget
would aim to balance the state's books for the first time in
over a decade and keeps national debt on a downward track as a
percentage of national income. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    The timing and backdrop could therefore hardly have been
better, said Ryan McGrath, head of fixed income strategy and
sales in Ireland for Cantor Fitzgerald.
    The deal, which was jointly managed by Barclays, BNP
Paribas, Citi, Danske Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan, allowed
Ireland to surpass its minimum funding needs for the year,
having previously raised 13.5 billion euros of a 14 to 18
billion euro target.

877,1981,83cd533366fadd9b3847a47d513beea4,Northern Ireland's DUP says it won't be bullied on Brexit,2018-10-11 5:13:26,EUR,4.36711,2018-10-11 5:13:47,"{'EUR': 'Positive', 'GBP': 'Positive'}","    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A lawmaker from the small
Northern Irish party that British Prime Minister Theresa May's
government relies on for support has said his party will not be
bullied in Brexit talks, and that an unacceptable deal will be
defeated in parliament.
    Writing in the Telegraph, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
lawmaker Sammy Wilson said May's British government should not
blink in negotiations and would face the consequences if it
submitted to ""draconian"" proposals from the European Union that
could keep Britain tied to its customs union.
    ""If the Government decides in the face of EU belligerence to
cut and run and leave part of the UK languishing in the stifling
embrace of the EU, then that would be totally unacceptable to us
and many others in the House of Commons,"" Wilson said, warning
of parliamentary defeat for any deal that crossed his party's
red lines.
    ""We will not be bullied into propping up a soft-touch
Government which gives in to the EU's demands.""    
    Earlier, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said
Britain must accept possible checks on goods moving between its
mainland and its province of Northern Ireland, saying Brexit
would trigger the need for customs, value-added tax and
compliance checks with EU standards. 
    Barnier said he realised such checks were politically
difficult but this was the consequence of Britons voting to
leave the EU.
    Britain has agreed a need for a ""backstop"" deal on the Irish
border in case a future trading arrangement is not finalised.
    But Wilson said reports of a Brexit deal involving either
the UK staying within the customs union for an unspecified
time-limited period or an arrangement that excluded Northern
Ireland from any trade arrangements that the UK made with other
countries in the future would be unacceptable. 
    He also said that the party would oppose the government if
the deal involved EU regulations being applied to goods and
services produced in Northern Ireland and checks on movements of
goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
    The BBC and Sky News have reported that the DUP is
considering voting down the government's budget next month if it
crosses the party's red lines on Brexit.    
    ""If the Government is putting these proposals into the
public domain to test the water, our advice is to get its toe
out quickly or it is going to get burnt,"" Wilson wrote.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Investors retreated to the safety
of German government bonds on Thursday, pushing down yields, as
the effects of a brutal selloff on Wall Street made themselves
felt across the world. 
    Italian yields were a touch higher ahead of a key set of
auctions, as market participants try to evaluate the country's
debt sustainability in the face of a high-spending budget plan
and a recent sharp rise in borrowing costs.  
    U.S. stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and the
Dow marking their biggest daily declines since Feb. 8, prompting
U.S. President Donald Trump to criticise the Federal Reserve.
[nL2N1WQ21Y] [nW1N1WQ007]
    The rout triggered a flight to safety bid, and the yield on
better-rated euro zone government bonds -- which move inversely
to price -- were all between four and five basis points lower. 
    German government bonds, seen as one of the safest and most
liquid assets in the world, were at the forefront of this
demand, with 10-year yields dropping six basis points to a
one-week low of 0.49 percent before settling at around 0.51
percent. <DE10YT=RR>     
    This came after U.S. Treasury yields dropped about eight
basis points to 3.15 percent, coming off a seven-year high hit
earlier this week on rate hike expectations. <US10YT=RR>     
    This yield could be buffeted either way later on Thursday,
with U.S. inflation data due at 1230 GMT. 
    ""It remains to be seen whether the accelerating equity
plunge is a healthy correction or the tip of the iceberg,""
Commerzbank analysts said in a note. ""For sure it creates a more
challenging environment for today's (Italian) auctions."" 
    
    KEY AUCTION  
    Short-dated Italian government bond yields were higher ahead
of a key set of auctions. Two-year yields were up one basis
point to 1.70 percent and five-year yields were five bps higher
at 2.92 percent. <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR> 
    This discrepancy is likely linked to the maturity of the
debt Italy plans to sell later on Thursday. Its debt agency will
look to raise up to 6.5 billion euros from the auction with
3-3.5 billion euros targeted to come from a three-year bond
sale. [nI6N1VP02J]
    This auction will give investors an indication of how costly
the recent sharp rise in Italian borrowing costs will prove to
Italy's public finances. 
    Italian yields are trading near four-year highs after the
new anti-establishment government's spending plans put the
country on a collision course with Brussels and raises questions
over the sustainability of public finances. 
    ""The key issue for Italy is debt sustainability, so that's
why the results of the auction are important,"" said
Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset
Management.     
    ""It's important to see what the demand is like, and what
sort of yields the bonds will sell at and the difference between
the yields of the different bonds as well.""
    The Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread, often used by
investors as a proxy for euro zone sentiment, has been in focus
as it has widened to as much as 316 bps earlier this week, well
over double what it was in April. 
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said last week
the government would not change its deficit targets even if the
gap widens to 400 basis points. [nS8N1PA07Q]
    On Thursday it widened once again to 303 bps, with Italy's
10-year yields rising three bps. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>

    By Joseph Nasr
    WEIDEN, Germany, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Omar Alnifawi was 16
when he fled Syria's civil war with his family. After four years
working menial jobs in Lebanon to help pay for their journey on
to Europe, he had given up on ever going back to school.
    Six years later, Alnifawi is enrolled at the Europa
Vocational School in the southern German state of Bavaria and
plans to become a mechanic.
    ""My friends who live outside Bavaria and who are almost as
old as I am ask me: 'How come you can go back to school and we
can't?',"" he said in the town of Weiden, near the Czech border.
    Politicians in Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), are some of the harshest critics
of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policy. But they
have also put in place one of Germany's most accommodating
education programmes for immigrants allocated to the state.
    Their view is if migrants are in Germany to stay, they need
to go to school so they can work - a pragmatic strategy they
hope will help fill job vacancies, integrate the newcomers and
appeal to voters bleeding left and right in Sunday's regional
election.
    Since the number of asylum seekers started to rise in 2011,
Bavaria has raised the age for compulsory education for asylum
seekers and refugees to 21, against 18 in the other 15 states.
In some cases, like Alnifawi's, educators can apply for an
extension to keep migrants in school until the age of 25.
    Most of the students are in vocational schools, with the
option of moving to university-track high schools if they excel.
    Bavaria has spent hundreds of millions of euros since 2015
to hire more than 2,000 teachers to teach German to some 58,500
refugee children. That compares to 1,500 positions set up by
Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), for
language classes for 95,000 children. 
    This year Bavaria has allocated 938 million euros ($1.1
billion) for integration efforts, more than any other state.
    It can afford to be generous. The state economy, home to
nine blue-chip DAX-30 companies including carmaker BMW,
engineering giant Siemens and sports retailer Adidas, grew 2.8
percent last year, outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent
and resulting in a 3-billion-euro budget surplus, the highest in
Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia had a deficit.
    Bavaria is also acting on the new national philosophy that
migrants today should assume a German national identity, in
sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s when ""guest workers"" were
welcomed on the expectation that they would eventually leave and
not integrate.    
    ""In other states, there is more pro-integration rhetoric and
less action,"" said Prof. Axel Pluennecke of the Cologne
Institute for Economic Research (IW). ""The opposite is true in
Bavaria: the rhetoric might sometimes be negative but the amount
of money and effort being thrown at integration is
incomparable.""
    The effort appears to be paying off. Migrants in the state,
which has taken in some 230,000 asylum seekers, are less likely
to fall into poverty and have higher employment rates than
anywhere else in Germany, according to a bi-yearly report
commissioned by the states to monitor integration.
    Migrant pupils in Bavaria also score higher in national
tests, according to the Education Monitor, a report on the state
of education in Germany published by Pluennecke's institute.
    Asked if NRW plans to raise the mandatory age for refugees
as Bavaria has done, an official at for the state's education
ministry who declined to be named said it was looking into
additional measures for older refugees.
    ""NRW offers young refugees between the ages of 16 to 25 many
education possibilities outside and inside the school system,”
the official added, without giving details. He declined to be
named.
       
    BLUEPRINT?
    Officials at the federal level say they are looking at
Bavaria's programme as a possible blueprint for the nation. 
    ""We are certainly looking at what is being done with
migrants in Bavarian schools,"" said a senior federal official
who is familiar with the government's thinking.
    ""Raising the mandatory vocational school age for migrants
could certainly be one of our recommendations.""
    It is essential that Germany get this right.
    The drop-out rate among migrants is 14.2 percent, compared
with a national average of just under six percent. Migrant youth
without a school certificate will find it harder to get one of
the estimated 1.2 million jobs that are currently vacant - the
main concern of an immigration law agreed October 1.
    ""Most of the young migrants are eager to work. They piled up
debt to come here or they have families to support back home,""
said Thomas Liebig of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. ""If they get a chance to do a small job, they
will and it will be difficult to bring them back into the
education system. So it's important to intercept them early.""
    But polls indicate the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria for
almost six decades, will lose its absolute majority in the
parliament on Oct. 14, giving ground to the ecologist Greens, on
the left, and on the right, the anti-Islam Alternative for
Germany (AfD).
    Political analysts say that's because CSU leader Horst
Seehofer's attempts to sound as anti-immigration as the AfD have
backfired.
    ""Voters who have decided to vote AfD will do so because they
don't believe his anti-immigration rhetoric is genuine,"" said
Julia von Seiche-Nordenheim, chairwoman of the 'Education
instead of Deportation' refugee charity in Regensburg.
    ""At the other end of the spectrum, people don't see refugees
as a threat... Those voters are going to the Greens,"" she said.
A longtime CSU voter, von Seiche-Nordenheim said she plans to
vote for the Green party.     
    
    CUSTOMISATION 
    Another problem in other states is that language courses
funded by the government are only open to accepted refugees and
asylum seekers from five countries with protection approval
rates of 50 percent or more: Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia and
Iran.
    This means that asylum seekers from other countries, who
make up about 50 percent of all applicants, can only access
those courses once their applications have been approved, which
takes seven months on average.
    In Bavaria, mandatory schooling applies to all asylum
seekers, regardless of the status of their application. 
    ""Bavaria has customised its vocational school system to meet
the needs of refugees,"" said Barbara Weiser, a lawyer and
education expert with the Catholic charity Caritas.
    About 55 percent of the 1.6 million people who have come to
Germany seeking asylum over the last four years are under the
age of 25. Many came from war zones and spent years with little
or no schooling. 
    ""Most of the pupils who came to us over the last three years
were unaccompanied minors,"" said Manfred Wichmann, head of the
migrant education programme at the Europa Vocational School. 
""Not only did they come without their parents, they had nothing
to prove what education they had.""
    The school created six classes this year in math, science
and German language, history and culture for 110 migrants. The
programme ends with a test, which between 80 and 85 percent of
pupils have been passing, Wichmann said. Those who fail can
repeat.
    Successful pupils move on to a programme that combines up to
3-1/2 years of on-the-job learning alongside theory lessons at
school. Students choose from dozens of professions, from baking
and hairdressing to banking and electronics.
    In one recent lesson, the teacher quizzed students about
events in Bavaria's history like the 1936 Winter Olympics and
the 1939 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Munich, as well
as contemporary issues such as the regional vote.
    After the class, Alnifawi said he dreams of settling in
Germany with a wife, children and a house in the countryside.
    ""But I know that without an education none of this is
possible.""

    MADRID, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Spain's Socialists, who hold a
minority in parliament and need the support of smaller parties
to pass legislation, have reached a budget deal with
anti-austerity party Podemos, paving the way for the current
government to stay in power until mid-2020.
    Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had faced growing pressure from
within his party to call an early election before scandals
besetting his four-month-old government undermine a surge in
voter support. [L8N1WK3IR]
    But the agreement, which includes raising the minimum wage,
tax hikes and a reform of the rental market and is expected to
be endorsed by other parties, now largely removes that risk. The
next national election should take place by mid-2020.
    The Socialists have just 84 seats in the 350-seat parliament
and with backing from Podemos - bringing them to 151 votes -
they must still enter in talks with parties in Catalonia and the
Basque Country to reach the necessary majority. 
    The opposition conservative People's Party (PP) and
Ciudadanos, which together hold 166 seats in the parliament,
have said they would vote against the budget proposal.
    The agreement includes raising the minimum wage to 900 euros
 ($1,039) a month from the current level of 735.90 euros. It
also includes proposals to reform the housing rental market, a
tax on financial transactions, a tax on digital services and tax
hikes for those earning more than 130,000 euros a year.
    Sanchez is riding high in the polls after his four-month
stint as prime minister and is under pressure from within his
party to consider an early election amid a slew of scandals that
have prompted two ministers to step down and targeted others.

    ROME, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Italian government's plan to
lower the retirement age will cost future generations around 100
billion euros ($115.4 billion), the chief of the state pension
agency INPS said on Thursday.
    The reform ""will increase pension debt for young people by
about 100 billion euros,"" Tito Boeri said in a parliamentary
hearing. 
    ""We have no choice but to sound an alarm,"" he added.
    The populist coalition, made up of anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement and right-wing League party, has promised to roll back
a 2011 reform that hiked the retirement age in a moment when
Italy was at the centre of the eurozone debt crisis.
    The executive has earmarked 7 billion euros ($8.1 billion)
in 2019 budget to allow people to retire at 62 if they have paid
pension contributions for at least 38 years.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said the
measure will allow 400,000 people to retire earlier than
expected, freeing up a similar number of jobs for young people. 
    After meeting a dozen of industry's top managers on
Wednesday night, Salvini said that state-controlled companies
are ready to hire tens of thousands of people if the retirement
age is lowered.[nL8N1WQ5TE]
    The Bank of Italy warned on Tuesday that lowering the
retirement age may put at risk the sustainability of the pension
system. According to studies conducted by the central bank,
there is no evidence that hiking pension age reduces youth
employment.
    Boeri told lawmakers that the new measures would increase
pension spending by 1 percentage point of the gross domestic
product (GDP) already in 2021.

to sell three-year debt on Thursday, in its first bond auction
since Rome's new populist government tripled the budget deficit
target for next year.
    The heavily indebted nation's borrowing costs have jumped
due to investor fears over Rome's plan to boost deficit

    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The French
investment bank may merge its small payments arm with $4.5 bln
compatriot Ingenico. That could help its lowly valuation since
the sector is rated more highly by investors. Yet struggling
Ingenico, whose shares have plummeted on growth concerns, looks
an odd partner.

 (Updates to reflect Italy auction result)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Investors retreated to the safety
of German government bonds on Thursday, pushing down yields, as
the effects of a sharp selloff on Wall Street made themselves
felt across the world. 
    This set an uncomfortable backdrop for a key Italian
auction, but the country's debt agency squeezed through a 6.5
billion euro bond sale, pulling yields off the day's highs.  
    U.S. stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and the
Dow marking their biggest daily declines since Feb. 8, prompting
U.S. President Donald Trump to criticise the Federal Reserve.
[nL2N1WQ21Y] [nW1N1WQ007]
    The sell-off triggered a flight to safety bid and the yield
on better-rated euro zone government bonds -- which move
inversely to price -- were all between four and five basis
points lower. 
    German government bonds, seen as one of the safest and most
liquid assets in the world, were at the forefront of this
demand, with 10-year yields dropping six basis points to a
one-week low of 0.49 percent before settling at around 0.51
percent. <DE10YT=RR>     
    This came after U.S. Treasury yields dropped about eight
basis points to 3.15 percent, coming off a seven-year high hit
earlier this week on rate hike expectations. <US10YT=RR>     
    This yield could be buffeted either way later on Thursday,
with U.S. inflation data due at 1230 GMT. 
    ""It remains to be seen whether the accelerating equity
plunge is a healthy correction or the tip of the iceberg,""
Commerzbank analysts said in a note. They said it created a
challenging environment for the Italian auction. 
    However, Italy did manage to sell a maximum 6.5 billion
euros of bonds with demand exceeding supply by a comfortable
margin for all of the bonds on offer, though yields were
expectedly far higher than in the previous auction. [nI6N1WD00B]
    ""It was a fairly mixed result, with strong demand for three
of the four bonds,"" said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet. 
    ""Overall it's not enough for the market to continue selling
off, pending any other developments we may even see a short-term
bounce,"" he said. 
    Italian yields had risen sharply across the curve ahead of
the auction but after the result came out they came off the
day's highs. 
    For example, the yield on two-year Italian bonds <IT2YT=RR>
fell seven bps from the day's high, though it was still up nine
bps on the day at 1.78 percent. 
    Benchmark 10-year yields <IT10YT=RR> were also off the day's
highs at 3.57 percent -- having hit 3.60 percent earlier -- and
the spread over Germany eased to 305 bps from 310 bps earlier. 
    Italian yields are trading near four-year highs after the
new anti-establishment government's spending plans put the
country on a collision course with the European Union and raised
questions over the sustainability of public finances.
    ""The key issue for Italy is debt sustainability, so that's
why the results of the auction are important,"" said
Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset
Management.     
    The Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread, often used by
investors as a proxy for euro zone sentiment, has been in focus
as it has widened to as much as 316 bps earlier this week, well
over double what it was in April. 
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said last week
the government would not change its deficit targets even if the
gap widened to 400 basis points. [nS8N1PA07Q]

    BERLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The German economy is losing
steam as rising trade tensions abroad and a lack of skilled
workers at home limit the growth prospects for Europe's largest
economy, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Thursday.
    Presenting the government's downwardly revised growth
forecasts, Altmaier said that the German economy would grow by
1.8 percent in both 2018 and 2019.
    This compared with earlier projections of 2.3 percent and
2.1 percent respectively. In 2017, the German economy grew by a
calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent. [nB4N1SN029]
    Germany's vibrant domestic economy will continue to propel
growth this year and next, with imports rising at a faster pace
than exports and net trade expected to hold back an upswing that
is seen entering its tenth year in 2019, Altmaier said.
    ""This is the longest upswing since 1966, the second longest
ever,"" he added, pointing to record-high employment, rising real
wages and planned tax relief for workers.
    Altmaier said, however, that Germany's growth outlook was
clouded by protectionist tendencies and international trade
disputes. The economy would also expand at a faster rate if
companies found skilled workers more quickly, he added.
    The centre-right minister called for swift implementation of
an EU-U.S. tariffs deal reached earlier this year to solve a
transatlantic trade conflict.
    Germany and its European allies will also support efforts to
safeguard the rules-based free trade order by reforming the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Altmaier said.
    The government's updated growth forecast confirmed a Reuters
report on Wednesday that showed Berlin views an escalation in
the global trade dispute as the main risk for the future.
[nL8N1WQ2R1]
    The minister also blamed revisions to previously reported
output data and slower production in the auto sector due to
difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard - the
Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Natixis <CNAT.PA>
is trying on some ill-fitting fintech clothes. Merging its small
payments business with a trendier rival makes sense. But 3.9
billion euro French compatriot Ingenico <INGC.PA> has one of the
most dowdy looks in an otherwise chic sector. 
    The 17 billion euro investment bank is giving itself an M&A
makeover. Last month it unveiled plans to sell some lending
businesses worth 2.7 billion euros to unlisted parent company
BPCE [BPCE.UL], and plough money into less capital-intensive
activities like asset management. On Thursday, the Paris-based
outfit said it was exploring a deal with payments group
Ingenico. 
    An outright acquisition is probably off the table. Natixis’
M&A war chest of 2.5 billion euros would cover only half the
potential outlay, assuming a 30 percent premium to Ingenico's
Wednesday closing price. That could require Chief Executive
Francois Riahi to ask shareholders to cough up – despite having
promised to return any spare capital to them.
    Natixis is more likely to merge its payments arm – which
reported 336 million euros of net revenue in 2017 – into
Ingenico, whose sales last year were 2.5 billion euros. That’d
give the bank a minority share of a bigger, publicly-listed
payments specialist. Investors might then find it easier to
value the division, boosting Natixis’ own rating. Payments
companies typically trade at much higher multiples than banks,
and Natixis is currently worth just 9.8 times forward earnings,
according to Refinitiv data. 
    Still, Ingenico is about as unsexy as payments companies
get. It is valued at 12.5 times forward earnings, according to
Refinitiv, a huge discount to Worldpay <WP.N> and Worldline’s
<WLN.PA> multiples of 20 and 30 times respectively, let alone
market darling Adyen <ADYEN.AS>, currently worth more than 100
times forward earnings. 
    Ingenico’s traditional focus has been selling hardware like
card machines, a much slower-growing slice of the market than
the acquiring business that Adyen and Wirecard specialise in,
which involves selling software to merchants to process
payments. Ingenico is pushing into that business too, but is
growing more slowly than peers, and competition is likely to hot
up as the sector consolidates. Before Thursday’s surge, its
shares had fallen by a third this year. Natixis’ shareholders
shouldn’t expect much of a lift.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - French bank Natixis on Oct. 11 said it was examining a
merger of its payments activities with Ingenico.
    - Payments company Ingenico has a current market
capitalisation of around 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion), while
Natixis - which is the corporate banking arm of French bank BPCE
- is currently valued at 18 billion euros. 
    - “Natixis confirms having an interest in exploring the
rationale of a possible industrial combination of Natixis’
payment activities with Ingenico Group and its businesses and
having preliminary discussions in this respect,” said Natixis.
    - Ingenico said it had received preliminary approaches for
""a strategic transaction"" and had initiated a review of its
options.
    - Natixis shares were down 3.4 percent to 5.4 euros at 0745
GMT on Oct. 11. Ingenico shares were up 12.6 percent to 70.8
euros.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A looming banking
headache could put Italy’s radical government on the spot.
Worsening investor sentiment caused by the Rome’s planned fiscal
binge and its defiant stance vis-à-vis EU partners is hurting
the country’s banks. The weakest ones, like mid-sized Carige,
need capital, but may struggle to raise it. Failure or a bank
rescue would both be politically toxic.
    Loss-making Carige <CRGI.MI>, Italy’s tenth-largest bank by
assets, was struggling long before Fitch Ratings’ warning on
Thursday that it might fail. A restructuring plan launched in
2017 stalled because of persistent shareholder squabbling.
Shareholders who stumped up more than 500 million euros of fresh
equity in December have seen half of it wiped out. The bank
needs 200 million euros or so to meet its capital requirements,
and probably another 300 million euros to cover for losses
linked to a bad debt clean up.
    An already bad situation has been made much worse by the
policies of the current government, a coalition of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League party.
With government bond yields surging, issuing hybrid bonds, as
the bank has promised to do, would command an interest rate well
above 10 percent, bankers say, hurting Carige’s already weak
margins. A takeover by another bank is also unlikely while other
lenders struggle with falling government bond prices. Some may
need to raise capital themselves.
    Carige is also vulnerable from a liquidity perspective. The
group relies mostly on its deposit base for funding. Fitch
Ratings worries that it could be vulnerable to outflows. That,
or failure to plug the capital gap could put it at risk of
resolution. Another crisis would be a difficult scenario for the
current executive. It has been critical of bankers and attacked
the previous government for its handling of past rescues, such
as Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>.
    Letting Carige fail, as Europe’s ‘bail-in’ rules require,
would shield taxpayers from any cost, but could hurt retail
creditors in Genoa, the birthplace of the 5-Star Movement.
Offering state-support, or nationalising the bank, would push up
Italy’s budget deficit and anger other voters. It might still be
the government’s preferred option. That would trigger an even
bigger clash with the European Union.
    On Twitter https://twitter.com/LJucca
    
    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Rating agency Fitch on Oct. 10 downgraded Banca Carige’s
long-term rating to CCC-plus from B-minus, saying there was a
“real possibility” the Italian bank could fail.
    - The rating firm said it would be “challenging” for Carige
to replenish its Tier 2 capital buffer, which is currently below
the level demanded by regulators.
    - The European Central Bank has given Carige until the end
of the year to plug the capital hole or find a partner.
Carige’s restructuring has been delayed by a boardroom dispute.
Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino was replaced in September.
    - Carige shares were down 10.2 percent at 0.0044 euros by
0840 GMT. The stock has fallen about 45 percent since the start
of the year.

    BERLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The German economy is losing
steam as rising trade tensions abroad and a lack of skilled
workers at home limit the growth prospects for Europe's largest
economy, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Thursday.
    Presenting the government's downwardly revised growth
forecasts, Altmaier said the economy would grow by 1.8 percent
in both 2018 and 2019.
    This compared with earlier projections of 2.3 percent and
2.1 percent respectively. In 2017, the German economy grew by a
calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent. [nB4N1SN029]
    Germany's vibrant domestic economy will continue to propel
growth this year and next, with imports rising at a faster pace
than exports and net trade expected to hold back an upswing that
is seen entering its tenth year in 2019, Altmaier said.
    ""This is the longest upswing since 1966, the second longest
ever,"" he added, pointing to record-high employment, rising real
wages and planned tax relief for workers.
    Germany's strong economy means that rising imports will help
to lower the country's large current account surplus to 7.1
percent of GDP in 2019 and 6.7 percent in 2020.
    The growth outlook is clouded, however, by protectionist
tendencies and international trade disputes, Altmaier said. The
economy would also expand at a faster rate if companies were
able to find skilled workers more quickly.
    The centre-right minister called for swift implementation of
an EU-U.S. tariffs deal reached earlier this year to solve a
transatlantic trade conflict.
    Germany and its European allies will also support efforts to
safeguard the rules-based free trade order by reforming the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Altmaier said.
    Turning to the problem of labour shortages, Altmaier said a
planned immigration law should help to attract skilled workers
from countries outside the European Union. He urged cabinet to
pass the legislation before the end of the year. [nL8N1WI1US]
    Altmaier estimated that trade-related uncertainty so far had
clipped off 0.1 percentage points of overall growth while labour
shortages are costing the economy roughly 0.2 percentage points.
    The government's growth forecasts confirmed a Reuters report
on Wednesday that showed Berlin views an escalation in the
global trade dispute as the main risk for the future.
[nL8N1WQ2R1]
    The ministry also blamed revisions to previously reported
output data and slower production in the auto sector due to
difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard - the
Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
    Altmaier also demanded tax relief for companies, but he
stopped short of confirming a report by daily Handelsblatt that
said he was in favour of lowering corporate taxes by around 20
billion euros ($23.15 billion) per year.
    Centre-left Finance Minister Olaf Scholz from the
co-governing Social Democrats (SPD) has rejected such a step,
arguing that the government should better use the money to
increase public investments in education and infrastructure.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A looming banking
headache could put Italy’s radical government on the spot.
Worsening investor sentiment caused by Rome’s planned fiscal
binge and its defiant stance vis-à-vis EU partners is hurting
the country’s banks. The weakest ones, like mid-sized Carige,
need capital, but may struggle to raise it. Failure or a bank
rescue would both be politically toxic.
    Loss-making Carige <CRGI.MI>, Italy’s tenth-largest bank by
assets, was struggling long before Fitch Ratings’ warning on
Thursday that it might fail. A restructuring plan launched in
2017 stalled because of persistent shareholder squabbling.
Shareholders who stumped up more than 500 million euros of fresh
equity in December have seen half of it wiped out. The bank
needs 200 million euros or so to meet its capital requirements,
and probably another 300 million euros to cover for losses
linked to a bad debt clean up.
    An already bad situation has been made much worse by the
policies of the current government, a coalition of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League party.
With government bond yields surging, issuing hybrid bonds, as
the bank has promised to do, would command an interest rate well
above 10 percent, bankers say, hurting Carige’s already weak
margins. A takeover by another bank is also unlikely while other
lenders struggle with falling government bond prices. Some may
need to raise capital themselves.
    Carige is also vulnerable from a liquidity perspective. The
group relies mostly on its deposit base for funding. Fitch
Ratings worries that it could be vulnerable to outflows. That,
or failure to plug the capital gap could put it at risk of
resolution. Another crisis would be a difficult scenario for the
current executive. It has been critical of bankers and attacked
the previous government for its handling of past rescues, such
as Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>.
    Letting Carige fail, as Europe’s ‘bail-in’ rules require,
would shield taxpayers from any cost, but could hurt retail
creditors in Genoa, the birthplace of the 5-Star Movement.
Offering state-support, or nationalising the bank, would push up
Italy’s budget deficit and anger other voters. It might still be
the government’s preferred option. That would trigger an even
bigger clash with the European Union.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Rating agency Fitch on Oct. 10 downgraded Banca Carige’s
long-term rating to CCC-plus from B-minus, saying there was a
“real possibility” the Italian bank could fail.
    - The rating firm said it would be “challenging” for Carige
to replenish its Tier 2 capital buffer, which is currently below
the level demanded by regulators.
    - The European Central Bank has given Carige until the end
of the year to plug the capital hole or find a partner.
Carige’s restructuring has been delayed by a boardroom dispute.
Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino was replaced in September.
    - Carige shares were down 10.2 percent at 0.0044 euros by
0840 GMT. The stock has fallen about 45 percent since the start
of the year.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British banks could face
potential credit rating downgrades if there is a disorderly
Brexit as this would be likely to trigger a domestic political
crisis and economic contraction, credit rating agency Standard &
Poor's said on Thursday.
    S&P said that UK banks' earnings and balance sheets would
provide a solid cushion against a disorderly Brexit. But the
agency also said: ""Their current ratings and/or outlooks may not
prove to be consistent with a disruptive Brexit accompanied by a
severe economic shock.""
    Britain and the European Union are aiming to reach agreement
on a divorce settlement in time for an EU summit next week.
    S&P said that while it expects an orderly departure in March
followed by a transition period to the end of 2020, some
financial institutions have reached a point of no return and are
setting up new hubs in the EU to avoid disruption.
    Even with an orderly Brexit, there would be pressure on
banks to shift euro-denominated clearing of transactions, such
as derivatives, from London-listed LCH <LSE.L> to the EU, S&P
said.
    Fitch Ratings, a rival ratings agency, said that UK banks
are well funded to face a no-deal Brexit, but could face
challenges if wholesale markets were disrupted for a lengthy
period.
    ""Their ratings should be able to withstand economic
deterioration in the no-deal scenarios,"" Fitch said in a
statement. 
    
    EURO CLEARING
    S&P reiterated warnings from the Bank of England on Tuesday
that derivatives markets face disruption from a no-deal Brexit
unless the EU allows EU customers to continue using LCH, part of
the London Stock Exchange, that clears the bulk of euro
denominated swaps. [nL8N1WP2EO]
    Some euro clearing of these transactions has already moved
to rival central counterparty (CCP) Eurex <DB1Gn.DE> in
Frankfurt.
    The EU is in the process of introducing a law that would
require LCH to be supervised by the bloc's regulators as well as
the Bank of England if it wants to continue serving EU
customers.
    ""While dual supervision could yet be a negotiated middle
ground for one or more U.K. CCPs, it appears challenging to
apply effectively in practice, not least when clear and rapid
decision making is required in a crisis,"" S&P said.
    Clearing houses such as LCH act as a financial backstop if
transactions they handle run into trouble.
    Pressure to shift euro clearing would moderately affect LCH,
S&P said.
    ""Our base-case view is that LCH Ltd will maintain its market
leading franchise in OTC interest rate swaps following Brexit,
and an (ratings) upgrade would depend on us becoming
increasingly confident in this outcome,"" the agency said.
    Fitch said there would be significant negative consequences
for banks and financial stability if no interim solution was in
place for derivatives ahead of a no-deal Brexit.

    By Conor Humphries and Gabriela Baczynska
    DUBLIN/BRUSSELS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British and EU
negotiators making headway on the Irish border hope for a Brexit
deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said, though the British
prime minister's Northern Ireland ally has stoked uncertainty by
warning it could vote against her. 
    Under pressure from all sides, Theresa May will meet some of
her ministers later on Thursday to discuss Brexit, hours after
her parliamentary partner, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),
threatened to withdraw its support if she accepts what it called
a ""draconian solution"" from the European Union.
    The DUP's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said the party's
10 members of parliament would vote against the UK budget and
consider voting no-confidence in May if the British government
breaks the DUP's red lines in Brexit talks.
    ""In breaking her promises she would be agreeing to break up
the United Kingdom,"" Wilson said. [nL8N1WR4I9]
    The DUP vehemently opposes any checks between Northern
Ireland and mainland Britain after Brexit, which is due in March
and would be the United Kingdom's biggest trade and foreign
policy shift for more than four decades.
    But at the same time, neither side wants to upset peace on
the island of Ireland by winding down the open border between
the British province there and EU member state Ireland. That
will become the only land border between the UK and the bloc. 
    EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday rammed home
that - while the bloc was looking at ways to carry out checks on
many goods away from the actual frontier - animal and animal
products would have to be screened on the border. [nL8N1WQ1GM]
    May has said she wants ""frictionless"" trade with the EU
after Brexit to help safeguard Britain's economy while regaining
full sovereignty. Her spokeswoman said on Thursday London would
present further proposals, which she described as ""regulatory
aspects"", for the backstop border arrangement ""in due course"". 
[nL9N1U5002]
    
    ""HEADWAY""
    Agreeing on how to maintain an open Irish border after
Brexit is the key hurdle now to sealing a divorce deal between
the EU and Britain. While London wants to regulate that by a
future trade deal with the EU, the bloc insists on an emergency
fix in case negotiating new relations takes longer, or fails.
    Both sides have made positive signals in recent days though
also indicated they were still short of a deal, which would
define the divorce terms and include an EU declaration stating
that it would seek the closest possible ties with Britain after
Brexit ranging from trade to security to research. 
    ""We are not there yet. There is no breakthrough - yet,"" 
Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman for the EU's executive
European Commission, told a news briefing on Thursday.
    Still, diplomatic sources on both sides of the talks told
Reuters that ""it was going well"" and that Brexit negotiators
locked away in Brussels this week were ""making headway""
specifically on the Irish issue. 
    They said tentative planning could see a breakthrough
announced on Monday when EU negotiators representing the bloc's
national leaders meet in Brussels without Britain. Britain's
Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, could also come to Brussels then
if weekend talks cover enough ground.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU, some
other British officials have voiced more caution, saying ""big
issues"" still lie in the way of any agreement. [nS8N1UL035]
    The 27 states remaining in the bloc hope to announce
""decisive progress"" in divorce talks at an EU summit next week
and then finalise their offer of close future ties with Britain
next month. 
    
    PRESSURE ON MAY
    As that departure date creeps closer, pressure on May from
various directions is intensifying.
    After meetings in Brussels earlier this week, the DUP issued
a series of terse warnings to May over the compromise that is in
the making between the EU and British negotiators.
    ""She will not have DUP support regardless of whether the
government tries to bribe, bully or browbeat us into accepting
it,"" Wilson also said.
    By withdrawing its support, the DUP could make it difficult
for May to pass legislation through parliament, including the
budget which will be voted on later this month.    
    In May's own Conservative party, some eurosceptic lawmakers
want to vote against her approach to exiting the EU as it would
not bring a sharp enough break from the bloc in their view.
    The parliamentary arithmetic is difficult for May who
commands a majority of only 13 lawmakers including the DUP. She
needs to keep either her own party onside or attract votes from
the main opposition Labour Party.
    Labour demands that Britain retain ""the exact same"" perks it
now has within the EU's customs union and single market -
something May's so-called Chequers plan does not meet and which
the EU rules out since London decided to leave both. 
    Former Labour leader Tony Blair added his voice to calls to
vote down any Brexit deal by May, hoping that would open the way
for another referendum in which Britons would this time decide
to stay, after their popular vote in June 2016 that resulted in
a narrow ""Leave"" victory. [nL8N1WR2RA]

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Investors retreated to the safety
of German government bonds on Thursday, pushing down yields, as
the effects of a sharp selloff on Wall Street made themselves
felt across the world. 
    This set an uncomfortable backdrop for a key Italian
auction, but the country's debt agency squeezed through a 6.5
billion euro bond sale, pulling yields off the day's highs.
    U.S. stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and the
Dow marking their biggest daily declines since Feb. 8, prompting
U.S. President Donald Trump to criticise the Federal Reserve.
[nL2N1WQ21Y] [nW1N1WQ007]
    That sparked a flight to safety bid and the yield on
better-rated euro zone government bonds -- which move inversely
to price -- fell two to four basis points. 
    Yields on 10-year German government bonds, seen as one of
the safest and most liquid assets in the world, fell as much as
six basis points to a one-week low of 0.49 percent before
settling at around 0.52 percent. <DE10YT=RR>  
    U.S. Treasury yields also fell to one-week lows on Thursday,
with a weaker-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation for September
adding to the bullish tone in bond markets. [nL2N1WR0LV]
    ""It remains to be seen whether the accelerating equity
plunge is a healthy correction or the tip of the iceberg,""
Commerzbank analysts said in a note. They said it created a
challenging environment for the Italian auction. 
    However, Italy sold a maximum 6.5 billion euros of bonds
with demand exceeding supply by a comfortable margin for all of
the bonds on offer, though yields were expectedly far higher
than in the previous auction. [nI6N1WD00B]
    ""It was a fairly mixed result, with strong demand for three
of the four bonds,"" said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet. 
    ""Overall it's not enough for the market to continue selling
off, pending any other developments we may even see a short-term
bounce,"" he said. 
    Italian yields had risen sharply across the curve ahead of
the auction but came off the day's highs after the debt sale. 
    Italy's two-year bond yield was last up 10 bps at 1.79
percent <IT2YT=RR> but off session highs at 1.85 percent.
    Benchmark 10-year yields <IT10YT=RR> were also off the day's
highs, trading at 3.57 percent and the spread over Germany eased
to 305 bps from 310 bps earlier. 
    Most Italian yields are trading near four-year highs after
the new anti-establishment government's spending plans put the
country on a collision course with the European Union and raised
questions over the sustainability of public finances.
    ""The key issue for Italy is debt sustainability, so that's
why the results of the auction are important,"" said
Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset
Management.
    Bond markets meanwhile showed little immediate reaction to
the policy minutes from the European Central Bank's last
meeting.
    Global trade tensions could slow euro zone growth further
and ECB policymakers debated whether to downgrade their risk
assessment, the minutes of their September meeting showed on
Thursday. [nL8N1WR3P0]

figure includes inward and outward payments)
    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Banks doing business
in Estonia, which has been at the centre of a money-laundering
scandal involving Danske Bank, handled cross-border transactions
of more than $1 trillion in and out of the country between 2008
and 2017, according to its central bank.
    The European Union member country of just 1.3 million people
has been rocked by revelations that banks there laundered money
from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via non-resident bank
accounts. The scandal has forced lenders in Estonia and 
neighbouring Latvia to shut down.
    The data on cross-border transactions, first reported by
Bloomberg, suggests that the scale of the money laundering
through the small Baltic country may have been larger then
previously thought. The news sent Nordic banking shares sharply
lower. 
    The central bank said that between 2008 and 2017,
cross-border transactions totalled 1.1 trillion euros ($1.27
trillion). The number includes all payments, including resident
and non-resident transactions, a spokesman said.
    Estonia's entire economic output came to about $25 billion
last year - roughly the same as that of Uganda or Nepal -
suggesting that much of the money flow was not directly linked
to economic activity in the country.
    The central bank did not say whether it considered any of
the payments suspicious. 
    Bloomberg on Wednesday reported figures from the central
bank saying that Estonia handled about 900 billion euros in
non-resident cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015.
    The central bank later said the figure in the Bloomberg
report doesn't relate specifically to non-resident transactions
but to all payments in and out of the country, including imports
and exports and routine financial transactions such as
securities purchases. 
    Estonia's imports and exports totalled 232 billion euros
between 2008 and 2017, official data showed. 
    The central bank said in a statement that non-resident flows
""only make up one part of the sum,"" adding that it does not
collect separate data for those transactions.
    ""This is a surprising figure,"" said Copenhagen-based expert
on money laundering Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft. ""This indicates
that the Danske case is not a one-off affair and that the
problem related to other banks as well.""
    Sweden's SEB and Swedbank, which both have banking
operations in Estonia, were trading 3.3 percent and 5.8 percent
lower, respectively. The region's biggest bank Nordea was
trading 2.9 percent lower, while Danske Bank, whose shares have
lost one-third of their value since March, was down 1.5 percent.
    A trader says this is ""clearly not good news in the light of
Danske Bank, and the numbers they are talking about look to be
bigger.""
    Another trader notes Nordic banks are ""very well owned"" -
seen as the best of a bad bunch among European financials – and
therefore vulnerable to bad news.
    Swedbank's Baltic operations account for nearly one-fifth of
its total operating profit, with Estonia its biggest market. 
    ""We have worked continuously through the years together with
authorities as well as correspondent banks to ensure that we
have solid systems and processes concerning the fight against
money laundering,"" a Swedbank spokesman said.
    ""Let me underline that we do not recognise ourselves in
Bloomberg's reporting. We are a retail bank with low risk,"" he
said.
    Sweden's Swedbank is the largest bank in Estonia following
its acquisition of Hansabank in 2005. It has 800,000 private
customers and around 140,000 business customers in the country,
according to its website. 
    Its Nordic rival SEB <SEBa.ST> also has major operations in
the Baltics after acquisitions in the late 1990s. It had 920,000
private and 99,000 corporate customers according to its 2017
annual report. 
    ""We have very few if any customers that are not based in the
Baltic countries,"" an SEB spokesman said. ""We feel satisfied
that our process concerning these issues works.""
    Figures reflecting the possible scale of money-laundering
through Estonia have been emerging gradually over the last few
months.
    In May, data from Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) showed that more than $13 billion had been laundered
through banks in the country from 2012 to 2016, with at least
7.3 billion of that going through non-resident bank accounts.
    Last month, Denmark's Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said in an
internal report that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many
of which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
    That compares to outgoing payments of $500 billion from
Estonia between 2008 and 2015, according to central bank data.  
    That scandal led to Danske's chief executive stepping down
and prompted regulators across the European Union to question
the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.

    ROME, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The cabinet will approve Italy's
2019 budget on Monday, five days before the official deadline
for presenting the financial package, Deputy Prime Minister
Luigi Di Maio said on Thursday.
    The government has already issued the financial targets that
will provide the framework for the budget, drawing fire from the
European Commission for plans to triple the previous fiscal
deficit goal for 2019. [nL8N1WM0IR]
    Ministers have said Brussels should reserve judgement until
full details of the budget are unveiled.
    ""Next week, on Monday, the cabinet will approve the budget,
which will then be sent to Brussels and to parliament,"" Di Maio,
who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement that governs
with the right-wing League, said on Facebook.
    Under Italian law, the government has until Oct. 20 to
approve a budget and pass the bill to parliament for review.
Both houses must then approve the package before the end of the
year.
    Di Maio's comments confirmed remarks made earlier on
Thursday by 5-Star's Senate leader Stefano Patuanelli, who told
reporters the government intended to approve the budget five
days ahead of the deadline, as ""a signal to Europe."" 
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria told a parliamentary
commission on Wednesday that deficit spending would total 22
billion euros ($25.5 billion) next year, with the budget
including 15 billion euros in cuts and extra revenue to help
cover 37 billion in total additional spending. [nL8N1WQ1DK]

    By Amanda Ferguson and Gabriela Baczynska
    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - British and EU
negotiators making headway on the Irish border hope for a Brexit
deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said, though the British
prime minister's Northern Ireland ally has stoked uncertainty by
warning it could vote against her.
    Under pressure from all sides, Theresa May told journalists
at Downing Street reception that talks on the key issue of the
Irish border were likely to continue until November, while
cabinet ministers who met with May on Thursday evening were
cited by the Financial Times as saying the border issue was
close to being settled. [nL8N1WR66U][nFWN1WR166]
    However, the Brexit spokesman of the Democratic Unionist
Party (DUP), May's parliamentary partner, said the DUP's 10
members of parliament would vote against the UK budget and
consider voting no-confidence in May if the British government
breaks the DUP's red lines in Brexit talks.
    ""In breaking her promises she would be agreeing to break up
the United Kingdom,"" Sammy Wilson said. [nL8N1WR4I9]
    Asked about the threat, May said: ""The DUP will do what the
DUP will do."" 
    The DUP vehemently opposes any checks between Northern
Ireland and mainland Britain after Brexit, which is due in March
and would be the United Kingdom's biggest trade and foreign
policy shift for more than four decades.
    But at the same time, neither side wants to upset peace on
the island of Ireland by winding down the open border between
the British province there and EU member state Ireland. That
will become the only land border between the UK and the bloc. 
    EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday rammed home
that - while the bloc was looking at ways to carry out checks on
many goods away from the actual frontier - animal and animal
products would have to be screened on the border. [nL8N1WQ1GM]
    May has said she wants ""frictionless"" trade with the EU
after Brexit to help safeguard Britain's economy while regaining
full sovereignty. Her spokeswoman said on Thursday London would
present further proposals, which she described as ""regulatory
aspects"", for the backstop border arrangement ""in due course"". 
[nL9N1U5002]
    
    ""HEADWAY""
    Agreeing on how to maintain an open Irish border after
Brexit is the key hurdle now to sealing a divorce deal between
the EU and Britain. While London wants to regulate that by a
future trade deal with the EU, the bloc insists on an emergency
fix in case negotiating new relations takes longer, or fails.
    Both sides have made positive signals in recent days though
also indicated they were still short of a deal, which would
define the divorce terms and include an EU declaration stating
that it would seek the closest possible ties with Britain after
Brexit ranging from trade to security to research. 
    ""We are not there yet. There is no breakthrough - yet,"" 
Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman for the EU's executive
European Commission, told a news briefing on Thursday.
    Still, diplomatic sources on both sides of the talks told
Reuters that ""it was going well"" and that Brexit negotiators
locked away in Brussels this week were ""making headway""
specifically on the Irish issue. 
    They said tentative planning could see a breakthrough
announced on Monday when EU negotiators representing the bloc's
national leaders meet in Brussels without Britain. Britain's
Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, could also come to Brussels then
if weekend talks cover enough ground.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU, some
other British officials have voiced more caution, saying ""big
issues"" still lie in the way of any agreement. [nS8N1UL035]
    The 27 states remaining in the bloc hope to announce
""decisive progress"" in divorce talks at an EU summit next week
and then finalise their offer of close future ties with Britain
next month. 
    
    PRESSURE ON MAY
    As that departure date creeps closer, pressure on May from
various directions is intensifying.
    After meetings in Brussels earlier this week, the DUP issued
a series of terse warnings to May over the compromise that is in
the making between the EU and British negotiators.
    ""She will not have DUP support regardless of whether the
government tries to bribe, bully or browbeat us into accepting
it,"" Wilson also said.
    By withdrawing its support, the DUP could make it difficult
for May to pass legislation through parliament, including the
budget which will be voted on later this month.    
    In May's own Conservative party, some eurosceptic lawmakers
want to vote against her approach to exiting the EU as it would
not bring a sharp enough break from the bloc in their view.
    The parliamentary arithmetic is difficult for May who
commands a majority of only 13 lawmakers including the DUP. She
needs to keep either her own party onside or attract votes from
the main opposition Labour Party.
    Labour demands that Britain retain ""the exact same"" perks it
now has within the EU's customs union and single market -
something May's so-called Chequers plan does not meet and which
the EU rules out since London decided to leave both. 
    Former Labour leader Tony Blair added his voice to calls to
vote down any Brexit deal by May, hoping that would open the way
for another referendum in which Britons would this time decide
to stay, after their popular vote in June 2016 that resulted in
a narrow ""Leave"" victory. [nL8N1WR2RA]

 (Adds poll on immigration law, report on possible tax cuts)
    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The German economy is losing
steam as rising trade tensions abroad and a lack of skilled
workers at home limit the growth prospects for Europe's largest
economy, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Thursday.
    Presenting the government's downwardly revised growth
forecasts, Altmaier said the economy would expand by 1.8 percent
in both 2018 and 2019.
    This compared with earlier projections of 2.3 percent and
2.1 percent respectively. In 2017, the economy grew by a
calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent. [nB4N1SN029]
    Germany's vibrant domestic economy will continue to propel
growth this year and next, with imports rising at a faster pace
than exports and net trade expected to hold back an upswing that
is seen entering its tenth year in 2019, Altmaier said.
    ""This is the longest upswing since 1966, the second longest
ever,"" he added, pointing to record-high employment, rising real
wages and planned tax relief for workers.
    Germany's strong domestic demand means that rising imports
will help to lower the country's large current account surplus
to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2019 and 6.7 percent in 2020.
    The growth outlook is clouded, however, by protectionist
tendencies and U.S. trade disputes with Europe and China,
Altmaier said. The economy would also expand at a faster rate if
companies were able to find skilled workers more quickly.
    The centre-right minister called for swift implementation of
an EU-U.S. tariffs deal reached earlier this year to solve the
transatlantic trade conflict.
    Germany and its European allies will also support efforts to
safeguard the rules-based free trade order by reforming the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Altmaier said.
    Turning to the problem of labour shortages, Altmaier said a
planned immigration law should help to attract skilled workers
from countries outside the European Union. He urged cabinet to
pass the legislation before the end of the year. [nL8N1WI1US]
    A poll conducted for ARD broadcaster showed on Thursday that
71 percent backed the planned immigration law while 26 percent
were against it, suggesting that the move could turn out to be
less risky for Merkel's coalition government than expected.
    Altmaier estimated that trade-related uncertainty so far had
clipped off 0.1 percentage points of overall growth while labour
shortages are costing the economy roughly 0.2 percentage points.
    The government's growth forecasts confirmed a Reuters report
on Wednesday that showed Berlin views an escalation in the
global trade dispute as the main risk for the future.
[nL8N1WQ2R1]
    The ministry also blamed revisions to previously reported
output data and slower production in the auto sector due to
difficulties adjusting to a new pollution standard - the
Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
    The Bild newspaper said a 10-point tax plan prepared by
ministry called for ""complete elimination"" of the 'solidarity'
tax imposed after German unification to support poorer states in
eastern Germany. The coalition agreement had called for the tax
to be phased out from 2021 for 90 percent of Germans.
    Altmaier also demanded tax relief for companies, but he
stopped short of confirming a report by daily Handelsblatt that
said he was in favour of lowering corporate taxes by around 20
billion euros ($23.15 billion) per year.
    Centre-left Finance Minister Olaf Scholz from the
co-governing Social Democrats (SPD) has rejected such a step,
arguing that the government should better use the money to
increase public investments in education and infrastructure.

raised its economic growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 on
stronger than expected domestic demand, but warned that even an
orderly Brexit would significantly dent growth over the next
several years. 
    In a quarterly report on the health of the economy, the
central bank estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) would
expand by 6.7 percent this year and 4.8 percent next year, up
from forecasts in July of 4.7 and 4.2 percent respectively.
    The Irish government last week forecast GDP growth of 7.5
percent in 2018 and 4.2 percent in 2019. [nL8N1WP4J5]
    Ireland has posted the fastest economic growth in the
European Union every year since 2014 but the relevance of using
the GDP benchmark has been put into doubt by foreign investment
flows skewing the figure.
    The central bank said underlying domestic demand, a measure
that strips out the impact of investment flows by Ireland's
large multinational sector, would grow 5.6 percent this year and
4.2 percent next year. 
    ""The underlying picture suggests that the growth of domestic
economic activity gathered pace in the first half of 2018,"" the
report said. ""Supported by strong and sustained employment
growth and improving household balance sheets, growth in
consumer spending has gained momentum.""
    Growth is also being boosted by construction, with
housebuilding growing by around 25 percent per year as the
country struggles to make up for several years of minimal
construction in the aftermath of the country's economic crisis,
the bank said.  
    The bank also published new estimates of the impact of
Brexit on Ireland. If Brexit leaves World Trade Organisation
rules governing trade between Britain and Ireland, Ireland's GDP
will be 2.9 percent lower in the long run. 
    If the Brexit proposal favoured by British Prime Minister
Theresa May - the so-called Chequers option - Irish GDP would be
1.7 percent smaller than if Britain remained in the EU's single
market and customs union, it said.

    MORNING CALL: RESPITE FOR EUROPEAN STOCKS? (0526 GMT)   
    European stocks look set for a bounce today after a stronger session in Asia overnight. Wall
Street extended its slide into a sixth session before that, though, and the Nasdaq flirted with
correction territory, down as much as 10.3 percent from its Aug 29 closing record high. 
    Asian shares found a slightly firmer footing to set course for their first gains in two
weeks, but the rout continued in Shanghai where shares hit lows last seen in 2014. [nL4N1WS1J1]
    The euro zone's STOXX is currently set for its worst week since February, but that may
change if the bounce proves material. 
    Spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,034, Frankfurt's DAX to
open 110 points higher at 11,649 and Paris' CAC to open 53 points higher at 5,160.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Sujata Rao. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has a
blunt message for Italy's leaders: Don't expect us to shield you
or your banks from financial market displeasure at your spending
plans. Sources at the ECB point to European Union rules that
state that cannot help a country unless it has already agreed on
an EU bailout in exchange for belt-tightening and painful
economic reforms - an option Rome has firmly rejected. This
message is in line with the one coming from Brussels sources,
which previously indicated to Reuters that it does not consider
Italy ""too big to save"" - in other words, the EU believes the
eurozone now has the structures in place both to limit any
contagion from Italy and then to clean up the mess afterwards.
As one source familiar with the ECB's thinking said: ""It’s a
test-case to show Europe and its mechanisms work.""
    The general noise coming out of British PM Theresa May's
cabinet meeting last night suggests that she gave ministers the
distinct impression a Brexit deal was imminent. That has in
turned prompted speculation that those ministers on the
hard-Brexit end of the spectrum are equally close to quitting,
given their fears that May's deal will bind the UK into
perennial vassalage; DUP officials are meanwhile talking darkly
of betrayal. In other words, it's all business as usual ahead of
next week's summit and probably only a foretaste of the
grandstanding to come over the next few weeks. Envoys from the
other 27 EU member states meet in Luxembourg to discuss the
state of play today.
    The big election over the weekend is in Bavaria, where the
incumbent conservative CSU party faces a major challenge from
the upstart AfD far-right movement. Polls show the CSU will win
at most 35 percent on Sunday, losing the absolute majority with
which it has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of
the post-war period. One possible outcome is that the socially
conservative party is forced into an alliance with the left-wing
Greens - odd bedfellows indeed. The election also has
consequences for national politics: the CSU are Merkel's
longstanding allies in Berlin, so anything that weakens them in
turn could make her coalition even more fragile. 
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
Is this it for the stock market bulls? Maybe not. After Wall
Street's SP500 fell another 2 percent last night -- weaker-than-
expected inflation numbers failed to staunch the bleeding -- 
futures are pointing to a strong rebound today. Asia’s MSCI
ex-Japan index has bounced 2 percent and Europe is set for a
firmer opening, too. But two big loss-making sessions have left
the S&P500 looking at its third straight week of losses –- the
longest weekly stretch in the red since June 2016.  It’s also
left investors scratching their heads for the reasons – is it
machine-based trading?  Trade tensions? The Fed? One theory has
been that equity markets, especially tech shares, have been
carried higher by momentum, above where they should reasonably
be -- the question is whether the same will apply on the way
down. But maybe that downturn has been deferred for the time
being. U.S. banks today kick off the third-quarter earnings
season, a crucial test for markets. Expectations are the quarter
as a whole will deliver 20 percent-plus earnings growth, which
should be a source of encouragement for equity investors.
    But fears may centre around China, where Shanghai stocks,
despite today’s 1 percent bounce, are set for almost a 10
percent fall this week. And the yuan is biting the dust again
today, down a quarter percent to the dollar to a near four-year
low on nervousness that a U.S. Treasury Department report due
next week will label Beijing a currency manipulator. What’s
more, latest Chinese trade figures may stoke President Donald
Trump’s ire. There’s no sign so far of trade wars denting
Chinese exports -- its trade surplus with the United States hit
a record high in September. However, the trade data may have
helped Shanghai stocks rebound 1 percent. 
    On the currency front, the dollar touched a fresh two-week
low against a currency basket, reeling from the equity selloff,
the weaker inflation data and Trump’s fresh criticism of the
Fed, whose rate rise he called ""ridiculous"".  But the dollar’s
weakness has provided some relief to emerging currencies, with
an index up almost half a percent and others, such as the Indian
rupee, rebounding from record lows. The other emerging-market
weak link -- the Turkish lira -- now seems firmly above 6 per
dollar, approaching two-month highs on hopes that a trial of a
U.S. evangelical pastor will result in his release. Sterling and
euro are motionless this morning, though the former is near
three-week highs, coiled like a spring for any sign of more
Brexit news. 
    European shares  were set to benefit from Asia’s rebound,
with futures extending gains up 0.7 to 1.2 percent across the
main euro zone and UK benchmarks. If the bounce is sustained,
the euro zone STOXX could make up some of this week’s heavy
losses, which have left it on track for its worst week since the
February selloff. Positive comments from the IMF could help
confirm Europe’s rebound: the head of the IMF’s European unit
said the direct impact of potential U.S. car tariffs on Europe
would be relatively limited, though they could still affect
investor sentiment. Big European brewers ABInBev and Carlsberg
could move after a source-based Reuters report that India’s
antitrust watchdog raided their offices in at least two Indian
cities as part of an investigation of alleged price-fixing.  
    In the UK, results from more asset managers are likely to
move shares after Jupiter and Hargreaves Lansdowne disappointed
on Thursday. Both Man Group’s and Ashmore’s funds under
management rose thanks to market gains and net inflows.
    Other stock movers: Sports Direct buys Glasgow department
store Frasers for 95 million pounds; Atalaya Mining to explore
strategic options; Lockheed, Rheinmetall to make joint bid to
supply German navy helicopters; Italy's Carige to look at naming
investment bank for tie-ups; Italy could have around 15 percent

percent; Tencent Music delays $2 billion U.S. IPO; India to
raise import tariffs on electronic and communication items;
Vonovia buys stake in residential portfolio from SNCF; Brexit
negotiators eye Monday breakthrough -- Northern Irish party ups
the ante.
    Emerging-market stocks rose almost 2 percent, snapping a
six-day losing streak that culminated in the biggest daily fall
since the Brexit vote market turmoil in June 2016. Asian shares
rebounded; Hong Kong, Taiwan and India jumped 2 percent and
China mainland shares gained 1 to 1.5 percent. However, the
latter are on track for their worst week since the emerging=
market rout in early February, while the broader MSCI’s EM index
is on track for a 2.8 percent fall over the week – its third
straight week in the red.
    Emerging-market currencies also chalked up healthy gains.
Turkey’s lira rose nearly 1 percent against the dollar,
extending a 2.5 percent gain the previous day, on expectations
that the standoff between Washington and Ankara over the U.S.
evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson could be resolved soon with
another court hearing in the case set for Friday. The currency
looks on track for a gain of around 4 percent for the week, its
best such advance since mid-August. South Africa’s rand sailed
0.8 percent higher ahead of a Moody’s ratings decision, though
markets widely expect the ratings agency to keep as is and await
the mid-term budget to be delivered by new Finance Minister Tito
Mboweni on Oct. 26.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - European stocks bounced back
strongly on Friday from a sharp selloff in world markets, after
Asian shares staged a partial recovery overnight.

were the biggest gainers, with the sector index <.SX8P> jumping
2.4 percent led by chipmakers Siltronic <WAFGn.DE>, AMS <AMS.S>,

    * Bavaria's anti-immigration rhetoric particularly harsh 
    * But state doing ""exceptional"" job with migrant education
    * More than half of asylum seekers are under 25
    * CSU poised to lose absolute majority in regional election

    By Joseph Nasr
    WEIDEN, Germany, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Omar Alnifawi was 16
when he fled Syria's civil war with his family. After four years
working menial jobs in Lebanon to help pay for their journey on
to Europe, he had given up on ever going back to school.
    Six years later, Alnifawi is enrolled at the Europa
Vocational School in the southern German state of Bavaria and
plans to become a mechanic.
    ""My friends who live outside Bavaria and who are almost as
old as I am ask me: 'How come you can go back to school and we
can't?',"" he said in the town of Weiden, near the Czech border.
    Politicians in Bavaria's conservative ruling party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), are some of the harshest critics
of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policy. But they
have also put in place one of Germany's most accommodating
education programmes for immigrants allocated to the state.
    Their view is if migrants are in Germany to stay, they need
to go to school so they can work - a pragmatic strategy they
hope will help fill job vacancies, integrate the newcomers and
appeal to voters bleeding left and right in Sunday's regional
election.
    Since the number of asylum seekers started to rise in 2011,
Bavaria has raised the age for compulsory education for asylum
seekers and refugees to 21, against 18 in the other 15 states.
In some cases, like Alnifawi's, educators can apply for an
extension to keep migrants in school until the age of 25.
    Most of the students are in vocational schools, with the
option of moving to university-track high schools if they excel.
    Bavaria has spent hundreds of millions of euros since 2015
to hire more than 2,000 teachers to teach German to some 58,500
refugee children. That compares to 1,500 positions set up by
Germany's biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), for
language classes for 95,000 children. 
    This year Bavaria has allocated 938 million euros ($1.1
billion) for integration efforts, more than any other state.
    It can afford to be generous. The state economy, home to
nine blue-chip DAX-30 companies including carmaker BMW,
engineering giant Siemens and sports retailer Adidas, grew 2.8
percent last year, outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent
and resulting in a 3-billion-euro budget surplus, the highest in
Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia had a deficit.
    Bavaria is also acting on the new national philosophy that
migrants today should assume a German national identity, in
sharp contrast to the 1950s and 60s when ""guest workers"" were
welcomed on the expectation that they would eventually leave and
not integrate.    
    ""In other states, there is more pro-integration rhetoric and
less action,"" said Prof. Axel Pluennecke of the Cologne
Institute for Economic Research (IW). ""The opposite is true in
Bavaria: the rhetoric might sometimes be negative but the amount
of money and effort being thrown at integration is
incomparable.""
    The effort appears to be paying off. Migrants in the state,
which has taken in some 230,000 asylum seekers, are less likely
to fall into poverty and have higher employment rates than
anywhere else in Germany, according to a bi-yearly report
commissioned by the states to monitor integration.
    Migrant pupils in Bavaria also score higher in national
tests, according to the Education Monitor, a report on the state
of education in Germany published by Pluennecke's institute.
    Asked if NRW plans to raise the mandatory age for refugees
as Bavaria has done, an official at the state's education
ministry who declined to be named said it was looking into
additional measures for older refugees.
    ""NRW offers young refugees between the ages of 16 to 25 many
education possibilities outside and inside the school system,”
the official added, without giving details. 
       
    BLUEPRINT?
    Officials at the federal level say they are looking at
Bavaria's programme as a possible blueprint for the nation. 
    ""We are certainly looking at what is being done with
migrants in Bavarian schools,"" said a senior federal official
who is familiar with the government's thinking.
    ""Raising the mandatory vocational school age for migrants
could certainly be one of our recommendations.""
    It is essential that Germany get this right.
    The drop-out rate among migrants is 14.2 percent, compared
with a national average of just under six percent. Migrant youth
without a school certificate will find it harder to get one of
the estimated 1.2 million jobs that are currently vacant - the
main concern of an immigration law agreed October 1.
    ""Most of the young migrants are eager to work. They piled up
debt to come here or they have families to support back home,""
said Thomas Liebig of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. ""If they get a chance to do a small job, they
will and it will be difficult to bring them back into the
education system. So it's important to intercept them early.""
    But polls indicate the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria for
almost six decades, will lose its absolute majority in the
parliament on Oct. 14, giving ground to the ecologist Greens, on
the left, and on the right, the anti-Islam Alternative for
Germany (AfD).
    Political analysts say that's because CSU leader Horst
Seehofer's attempts to sound as anti-immigration as the AfD have
backfired.
    ""Voters who have decided to vote AfD will do so because they
don't believe his anti-immigration rhetoric is genuine,"" said
Julia von Seiche-Nordenheim, chairwoman of the 'Education
instead of Deportation' refugee charity in Regensburg.
    ""At the other end of the spectrum, people don't see refugees
as a threat... Those voters are going to the Greens,"" she said.
A longtime CSU voter, von Seiche-Nordenheim said she plans to
vote for the Green party.     
    
    CUSTOMISATION 
    Another problem in other states is that language courses
funded by the government are only open to accepted refugees and
asylum seekers from five countries with protection approval
rates of 50 percent or more: Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, Somalia and
Iran.
    This means that asylum seekers from other countries, who
make up about 50 percent of all applicants, can only access
those courses once their applications have been approved, which
takes seven months on average.
    In Bavaria, mandatory schooling applies to all asylum
seekers, regardless of the status of their application. 
    ""Bavaria has customised its vocational school system to meet
the needs of refugees,"" said Barbara Weiser, a lawyer and
education expert with the Catholic charity Caritas.
    About 55 percent of the 1.6 million people who have come to
Germany seeking asylum over the last four years are under the
age of 25. Many came from war zones and spent years with little
or no schooling. 
    ""Most of the pupils who came to us over the last three years
were unaccompanied minors,"" said Manfred Wichmann, head of the
migrant education programme at the Europa Vocational School. 
""Not only did they come without their parents, they had nothing
to prove what education they had.""
    The school created six classes this year in math, science
and German language, history and culture for 110 migrants. The
programme ends with a test, which between 80 and 85 percent of
pupils have been passing, Wichmann said. Those who fail can
repeat.
    Successful pupils move on to a programme that combines up to
3-1/2 years of on-the-job learning alongside theory lessons at
school. Students choose from dozens of professions, from baking
and hairdressing to banking and electronics.
    In one recent lesson, the teacher quizzed students about
events in Bavaria's history like the 1936 Winter Olympics and
the 1939 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in Munich, as well
as contemporary issues such as the regional vote.
    After the class, Alnifawi said he dreams of settling in
Germany with a wife, children and a house in the countryside.
    ""But I know that without an education none of this is
possible.""

euro zone increased in August by more than forecast, reversing
the negative trend of the previous two months in what could
prove a boost for the bloc's economic growth in the third
quarter, data released on Friday showed.
   The European Union statistics agency Eurostat said industry
output in the 19-country currency bloc was up in August by 1.0
percent on the month and by 0.9 percent year-on-year.
   Both figures are a positive surprise after economists polled
by Reuters had forecast a smaller 0.4 percent rise
month-on-month and a 0.2 percent drop from a year earlier.
    The monthly production growth in August reversed declines in
June and July, which had strengthened the view of a slowdown in
the euro zone's economy into and in the third quarter, hit by
global trade tensions and falling economic sentiment.
    The bloc grew by 0.4 percent in the two first quarters of
the year. Eurostat will release its preliminary flash estimate
of euro zone's growth in the third quarter on October 30.
    Eurostat also revised up its previous estimates for
industrial production in July. It said on Friday that output
fell by 0.7 percent on the month instead of the 0.8 percent drop
estimated earlier. Year-on-year, production increased by 0.3
percent instead of falling by 0.1 percent.
    The August output growth on the month was driven by a 1.9
percent rise in energy production, data showed.
     The production of durable consumer goods, like cars and
fridges, also increased by 1.5 percent, partly offsetting its
1.9 percent drop of the previous month.
    The surprising large increase in the output in a summer
month was also due to a 1.4 percent rise in the production of
non-consumer goods, like clothes, and of capital goods, such as
machineries, which tend to indicate managers' growing appetite
for investments.
    The overall increase came despite no expansion of industrial
output in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, Eurostat
data showed. The figures are not the same as those already
reported by Germany, which showed a slight fall in August, but a
less pronounced decline in July. [nL8N1WO0UI]

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - European stocks staged a
half-hearted recovery on Friday from a sharp selloff on world
markets, after Asian shares also had a partial bounceback
overnight.
    Euro zone stocks initially jumped 1 percent but rapidly shed
some of those gains. The main regional index <.STOXXE> was up
0.4 percent by 0900 GMT, with Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and
Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> 0.4 and 0.5 percent higher,
respectively.
    The main index remained on course for its biggest weekly
fall since February, down 4.3 percent, and the rapid fade in the
bounce showed how jittery investors remained after big drawdowns
this week. 
    ""The marginal traders of stocks are ETFs and quantitative
funds and that's all OK when it's going up, but it's reinforcing
on the way down as well. The more it goes down the more it goes
down,"" said Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton in London. 
    Third-quarter results were beginning to trickle in from
European firms, with investors' eyes on Wall Street banks which
report later on Friday, formally kicking off the earnings
season. 
    Europe lags far behind the U.S. in terms of earnings growth,
and stronger results will be critical in luring back some of the
billions that have been pulled out of European stocks this year.
[nL8N1WQ32X] 
    Tech stocks - the worst hit by this week's sudden drop -
were among the biggest gainers, with the sector index <.SX8P> up
0.3 percent led by chipmakers Siltronic <WAFGn.DE>, AMS <AMS.S>,
and STMicroelectronics <STM.MI>. 
    Dutch biotech Argenx <ARGX.BR> topped the STOXX with a 6.2
percent gain after its U.S. listed-shares gained 14 percent on
Wall Street on a positive note from broker Piper Jaffray. 
    The growth-sensitive autos <.SXAP> sector climbed 0.6
percent, while banks <.SX7P>, which benefit from rising yields,
were the best performers, up 0.7 percent. 
    Luxury stocks, which had also suffered sharp falls as
investors targeted the most highly-valued parts of the market,
climbed too. 
    Gucci owner Kering <PRTP.PA> topped France's CAC 40 with a
3.1 percent gain, while LVMH <LVMH.PA>, Moncler <MONC.MI> and
Salvatore Ferragamo <SFER.MI> rose 1.7 to 1.9 percent. 
    Investors had sold the sector due to its big exposure to
Chinese consumers amid fears about slowing growth in the world's
second biggest economy. 
    ""The recent derating appears overdone,"" wrote Credit Suisse
analysts. ""We see a repeat of the 2013-15 scenario as
unlikely... The luxury sector has become less reliant on China
to grow.""
    Among the biggest fallers were tobacco stocks Imperial
Brands <IMB.L> and British American Tobacco <BATS.L>, down 3.5
and 1.9 percent after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
reiterated its focus on reducing the amount of nicotine in
cigarettes in a presentation on Thursday. 
    ""The FDA are being increasingly noisy about the fact they're
serious about this,"" said Miton's Moore, who holds both Imperial
and BAT in his fund. 
    ""(Tobacco stocks) still have quite attractive financial
characteristics but the tricky bit from the shareholder point of
view is understanding the duration of the business.""
    Broker notes also moved some stocks. 
    Online retailer Zalando <ZALG.DE> gained 3.7 percent and
Asos <ASOS.L> rose 2.3 percent after Credit Suisse analysts said
they were confident that in Europe retail brands preferred the
two firms' platforms to Amazon <AMZN.O>. [nL8N1WS0MK]

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Italy must respect
European Union budget rules with its 2019 budget and improve
public finances if it wants to create headroom to loosen fiscal
policy during the next economic downturn, a top International
Monetary Fund official said.
    Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF's European department,
told a news conference on Friday that Rome was wrong to target
an increase in its headline and structural budget deficit next
year in breach of EU budget rules.
    ""We still project relatively strong growth in Italy next
year. This is not the time to relax fiscal policy, this is the
time to have some fiscal structural adjustment,"" Thomsen said at
the IMF's annual meeting on the Indonesian resort island of
Bali.
    The populist government in Rome plans a headline gap of 2.4
percent of GDP next year, triple the previous administration's 
target. EU officials estimate this would translate in to a rise
in the structural deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP, while EU rules
ask for a 0.6 percent cut, rather than an increase.
    ""A fiscal relaxation of that magnitude... is not correct.
The market reaction has been quite unfavourable and that
illustrates the point about fiscal space,"" Thomsen said.
     Investors have been selling Italian bonds in reaction to
the higher borrowing plan with yields of the three year paper
hitting 5-year highs at an auction on Thursday and 10-year
benchmark paper trading at 4.5 year highs <IT10YT=TWEB>.
    The European Commission, which is the guardian of EU rules,
and euro zone finance ministers have said the planned deficit
most likely meant a rise in Italy's public debt which is already
the second biggest in Europe at 133 percent of GDP.
    Italy's Economy Minister Giovanni Tria raised many eyebrows
earlier this month at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers
when he said in an ad-hoc presentation of the draft that despite
the deficit increase, debt would fall.
    EU officials at the Bali meeting said this would only be
possible if economic growth generated by the higher deficit was
very high.
    But the 1.4 percent economic growth forecast by the Italian
government for next year and 1.5 seen in 2020 has already been
declared as too optimistic by the Italian Fiscal Board - an
independent body set up to check budget assumptions.
    EU officials also note that higher borrowing costs for
Italy, triggered by the announcement of the higher deficit plans
already offset much of the expected higher growth. 
    ""If anybody has to give advice to Italy it's to be careful
what it's doing,"" Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz said in
Bali on Friday.
    Tria reaffirmed his ""intention to maintain a constructive
dialogue with the EU Commission and the other euro area
partners"" on Friday after meeting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin in the resort island.

    LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May was struggling on Friday to find consensus on Brexit
proposals that would be acceptable to her ministers, her
Conservative Party and the Northern Irish lawmakers who prop up
her minority government. 
    Brexit negotiations with the European Union have accelerated
and become more positive over the past week, though significant
hurdles remain, finance minister Philip Hammond said.
    ""What has happened over the last week, 10 days, is that
there has been a measurable change in pace,"" he told the BBC. 
    ""But that shouldn't conceal the fact that we still have some
big differences left to resolve,"" Hammond said. ""So process is a
lot more positive this week - substance still very challenging.""
    With less than six months to go until the United Kingdom is
due to leave the EU, May is seeking to rally support at home on
the details of a divorce deal though it is unclear if she can
win parliament's approval for any agreement.
    British and EU negotiators are making headway on the Irish
border issue, the biggest hurdle to an overall agreement, and
hope for a Brexit deal breakthrough on Monday, diplomats said.
[nL8N1WR36O]
    The Irish border ""backstop"", which seeks a way to avoid
customs checks on the frontier between the British province of 
Northern Ireland and Ireland if there is no overall exit deal,
has become the biggest sticking point in negotiations.
    As both sides seek to clinch a deal, the United Kingdom will
publish on Friday more of its so-called technical notices which
lay out the impact of a no-deal Brexit on specific sectors of
the economy. [nL8N1WA4KA]
    
    DEAL OR NO-DEAL?
    May's Northern Irish supporters vehemently oppose any checks
between the province and mainland Britain after Brexit.
    The head of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster,
said May ""could not in good conscience"" back an EU proposal for
checks on goods being imported to Northern Ireland from Britain
after Brexit.
    Under May's proposals, the whole of the United Kingdom would
forge a customs partnership with the EU after a transition
period ends in December 2020 in the event of the backstop being
triggered.
    Some of May's ministers have urged her to put a time limit
on that plan.
    The Times newspaper said May was warned the issue was so
serious that she could face further cabinet resignations unless
she found a way to ensure the backstop was not permanent. 
    Speaking to Northern Ireland journalists at her Downing
Street office, May said on Thursday that talks on the Irish
backstop were likely to continue until November.

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Central European equities rose
on Friday, tracking a rebound in Asian and Western European
markets after a sell-off in the previous session.
    Warsaw's bluechip index <.WIG20> led, rising over one
percent after Thursday's fall to a 3-month low. 
    Oil group PKN Orlen <PKN.WA> was the biggest gainer having
been the major loser in Thursday's rout.
    The region's currencies firmed, with Poland also leading as
the zloty <EURPLN=> rose 0.2 percent to 4.3 versus the euro, a
psychologically important level for markets. 
    Central European currencies have held firm despite a drop in
equities and government bonds over the past few weeks, driven by
an increase in U.S. bond yields, concern over Italy's debt and
worry over equity valuations worldwide.
    The region's two most liquid currencies, the zloty and the
forint have been rangebound around key levels versus the euro
since early September: the zloty near 4.3 and the forint around
325.
    Poland's disciplined budget and healthy economic growth
should earn it a credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's
late on Friday, Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said.
    But the agency may still keep the rating at BBB+ due to
Warsaw's tensions with the European Commission over the rule of
law, he said in a note. Moody's may upgrade the Czech Republic
on Friday, Shlizhyus said.
    Santander analysts said in a note that ""an upgrade from S&P
(for Poland) is not very likely"" due to politics.
    ""Moreover, rising worries about global slowdown and risk
factors (hard Brexit) do not create favourable environment for
upgrades,"" they said.
    Poland's 10-year government bond yield <PL107611=PW> dropped
1 basis point to 3.25 percent, having hit 5-month highs above
3.3 percent this week.
    The past two weeks' surge in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield
had caused bond selling in Central Europe, with Hungary's
long-term bonds worst hit, before the past two days' rebound.
    The 10-year Hungarian paper was quoted at around 3.87
percent, the average yield set at Thursday's auctions, with the
tenders robustly bid after the recent yield rise. 
    The 10-year yield held near the 3-year highs reached above
3.9 percent on Wednesday.
    Hungarian bonds underperformed in the sell-off because
Hungary's central bank has the lowest short-term interest rates
in the region, with 3-month bills sold at negative yields this
month at their auctions.
    ""I do not expect the bank to change interest rates or say
anything new (at its upcoming meeting on Tuesday),"" one forint
trader said.

    PARIS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - France demanded on Friday that
Saudi Arabian authorities provide detailed and truthful answers
over the fate of veteran Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who
disappeared in Turkey over a week ago.
    France, whose ambassador to Saudi met Foreign Minister Adel
al-Jubeir on Thursday, has been hitherto guarded in its
reaction. Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic ties and
commercial relations spanning energy to finance and arms. 
    ""The disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul ... has
raised serious questions about his fate. France asks that the
facts be clearly established and that all those who can
contribute to the truth fully contribute to it,"" Foreign
ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll said in a statement. 
    ""This is the message we passed to Saudi authorities. The
charges brought against them require that they be transparent
and provide a complete and detailed response.""
    France has in recent years nurtured close links with the
Sunni-ruled Gulf Arab states, notably Saudi Arabia, which valued
Paris' tough stance on Iran in nuclear negotiations and are
closely aligned with regard to other Middle East conflicts.
    Saudi is one of France's biggest weapons purchasers, but
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's uncompromising effort to
counter Iran's growing influence in the region are sometimes
perceived as reckless in Paris.
    Diplomats talk of tough conversations in private between
President Emmanuel Macron and Prince Mohammed. Macron has,
though, been careful not antagonise the kingdom.

chief Guenther Oettinger said on Friday Britain would lose its
rebate even in the ""pleasant but improbable"" event of it staying
in the bloc. 
    On March 29, Britain is due to become the first country to
ever leave the EU. It expects a status-quo transition until the
end of 2020 during which it would continue paying contributions
to the bloc and follow its rules.
    It would in exchange keep access to the bloc's single market
and customs union but no longer have a say in decision-making
that would be done by the other 27 states staying in the EU.
    After Brexit, the EU wants to wind down in stages all the
rebates, including those that the Netherlands or Denmark enjoy.
[nL8N1WS26X] The bloc's executive European Commission has
proposed to have none in the next common budget for 2021-2024.
    ""I think that even for the pleasant but improbable case that
the British wish to remain... then in my budgetary framework I
would stick to the phased ending of rebates. The rebates, in a
family of 27, are no longer appropriate.""
    Britain currently can recover about a half of its
contributions to the bloc through the deal. 
    Many question whether Britain and the EU can finalise
extremely complex negotiations on a new, broad trade pact in
less than two years. 
    Any extension of the transition period, as suggested by
Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond on Friday
[nL9N1VZ00W], would raise the issue of the British rebate as it
would coincide with the bloc entering the new budgetary period
that could already be rebate-free.

Le Pen met Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon and
backed his plan to advise eurosceptic parties ahead of next
year's European elections, a senior lawmaker in her party said
on Friday.
    A few days earlier, Le Pen had appeared to distance herself
from Bannon. At a meeting with Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini on Monday, she said Bannon was American and it
was up to European parties to shape their own politics.
    But at their meeting on Thursday, Bannon, an architect of
President Trump's 2016 election victory and former chairman of
Breitbart news, may have won Le Pen round, according to Louis
Aliot, a senior member of Le Pen's National Rally and also her
partner. 
    ""Bannon wants to create a think-tank, and particularly wants
to provide technical support to eurosceptic parties,"" Aliot told
BFM TV. ""We're not going to say no since he's not creating a
political party.""
    In July, Bannon said he aimed to create an organisation
called The Movement to unite Europe's far-right ahead of the May
2019 European Parliament elections. But he has generated little
support from parties so far. 
    Aliot said any misunderstandings between Bannon and Le Pen
had been reconciled during their meeting.
    ""We've seen that there was a convergence of views,"" Aliot
said, adding that Bannon would not campaign in the European
elections or provide financing, but would offer advice and
expertise. 
    Le Pen, who has struggled to rebound since losing last
year's presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron, is
banking on the European election to boost her party, which came
first in France in the last such vote, in 2014.
    The campaign is shaping up as a battle between Macron's
vision of a more integrated, united European Union and Le Pen's
view that too much national identity has been surrendered to
Brussels.
    In a survey by pollster Elabe last week, the number of
French voters who regard the EU as having more benefits than
drawbacks dropped by eight percentage points from a year ago, to
24 percent. 
    Thirty-eight percent said the EU brought more drawbacks than
benefits, while nearly two-thirds said they did not think Macron
would be able to change the EU for the better, despite it being
one of his main policy goals.
    Bannon won resounding applause for a speech at a Le Pen's
party congress in March [nL5N1QS0J2] and has maintained regular
contacts since, party officials said.

Recovery Rating 'RR3'. A full list of rating actions is below.

The ratings of eir reflect its limited deleveraging over the past two years due 
to high capital intensity and significant restructuring costs. We expect capex 
to remain high as eir aims to significantly roll out fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) 
network technology over the next five years.  

The ratings also reflect eir's position as the leading telecoms operator in a 
competitive Irish market. We believe the recent change in ownership is broadly 
positive given the strategic focus on customer service, network investment and 
cashflow generation, albeit with execution risks. In the medium-term, growing 
EBITDA from stabilising revenue and a lower cost base with declining 
restructuring costs should increase eir's deleveraging capacity.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Ownership Change Broadly Positive:  In April 2018, Xavier Niel-run entities NJJ 
and Iliad acquired a 64.5% stake in eir. The likely emphasis on operational 
efficiency in line with Niel's track record in other countries is broadly 
positive for eir's ratings. This is evident in a 25% voluntary staff reduction, 
which should yield a low single-digit improvement in eir's EBITDA margin. The 
new management team are also planning significant process simplification and IT 
improvements, together with customer service and network investment. These 
changes over the next two to three years should improve eir's financial 
performance, but there are significant execution risks in achieving these 
ambitious plans.

Competitive Irish Market: eir continues to defend its market position amid 
intense competition. In the financial year to June 2018, underlying revenue fell 
2%, while EBITDA increased 2%. The company's convergence strategy has 
underpinned the introduction of higher-value customer bundles, with 29% of eir's 
customers on a triple/quad play bundle. The quality of eir's mobile subscriber 
base is improving with 52% of eir's mobile customer base now on a post-paid 
contract. We expect average revenue per user (ARPU) to gradually improve in the 
next two years given the emphasis on higher value products, continued fibre 
take-up, and general Irish macroeconomic improvement. 

FCF Generation to Improve: Personnel cost reduction, among other things, is 
expected to support margin expansion into FY19. Funds from operations (FFO) 
adjusted net leverage has historically been constrained by substantial cash 
restructuring costs and high capital intensity. Over the next three years, 
growing EBITDA from stabilising revenue and a lower cost base with falling 
restructuring costs should increase free cashflow (FCF) and therefore eir's 
deleveraging capacity.

Network Investment: eir has invested heavily in its fibre network and LTE mobile 
deployment (96% population coverage as at June 2018) over the past few years to 
become Ireland's leading fibre and fixed-mobile convergence network. The 
company's fibre network (mainly fibre to the cabinet) at end-June 2018 passed 
1.8 million premises (76% of Irish premises) and connected 635,000 customers, at 
a customer penetration rate of 36%.

FTTH Roll-Out Plans: eir intends to rollout FTTH technology more extensively 
into urban areas, challenging Virgin Media's cable offering. This project will 
be part of a wider EUR1 billion investment plan spread over five years, and we 
expect capex to remain at around 23%-24% of revenue until FY22. We believe that 
this will help to cement eir's position as the leading fixed network provider in 
Ireland, and help it to improve its broadband market share and ultimately grow 
revenue. In our view, eir's withdrawal from the National Broadband Plan (NBP) is 
neutral for the company's rating given that expected winners, such as, enet are 
likely to rely on eir's infrastructure to meet its NBP obligations. 

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Relative to its European telecoms incumbent peers, such as Royal KPN N.V 
(BBB/Stable) eir has higher leverage, a smaller size, and the lack of leadership 
in the mobile segment. Its EBITDA margin is similar to peers', but pre-dividend 
FCF margin has historically been lower due to higher capex as a percentage of 
revenue and cash restructuring costs. Leveraged peers include Wind Tre SpA 
(B+/Stable standalone) and DKT Holdings ApS (B+/Stable), with eir maintaining 
higher margins than Wind but in line with DKT and displaying better potential 
deleveraging capacity than both peers.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer

-Revenue to decline 3.1% in FY19, followed by gradual stabilisation 

-EBITDA margin to increase to 45.5% in FY19 due to the voluntary redundancy 
programme

-Capex at of around 23%-24% per year of revenue until FY22

-No significant dividend payments

-No M&A transactions

Key Recovery Rating Assumptions

The recovery analysis assumes that eir would be considered a going concern in 
bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganised rather than liquidated. We 
have assumed a 10% administrative claim in the recovery analysis.

eir's recovery analysis assumes a post-reorganisation EBITDA 25% below FYE18's.

For our recovery analysis, we apply a distress enterprise value multiple of 
5.0x, which is comparable with peers and reflects a conservative mid-cycle 
multiple. 

Fitch assumes fully drawn revolving credit facilities (RCF) in its recovery 
analysis as super senior, given the likelihood it will be tapped during 
financial distress.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

-FFO adjusted net leverage expected to remain at or below 4.5x on a sustained 
basis when combined with

- FCF margin expected to be consistently in the mid single digits, with ongoing 
revenue stability and EBITDA improvement

-Strengthened operating profile and competitive capability demonstrated by 
stable fixed broadband market share with increasing fibre penetration and mobile 
market share

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- FFO adjusted net leverage above 5.0x on a sustained basis

- Weaker cashflow generation with FCF margin expected to remain in the low 
single digits, driven by lower EBITDA or higher capex

- Deterioration in the regulatory or competitive environment leading to a 
material reversal in positive operating trends

LIQUIDITY

Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity at end-June 2018 was supported by EUR197 million 
of cash, an undrawn EUR150 million RCF maturing in 2022 and forecasted positive 
pre-dividend FCF of EUR60 million-EUR130 million over the next four years. eir's 
first large debt maturity is in 2022.

on Friday became the latest ally to demand answers from Saudi
Arabia on the fate of veteran Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
last seen in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul more than a week
ago. [nL8N1WS267]
    France had so far been guarded in its reaction to the
disappearance; Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic ties and
commercial relations spanning energy, finance and arms.
    ""I'm waiting for the truth and complete clarity to be

    ""What's been mentioned is serious, very serious ... France
wants everything to be done so that we have all the truth on

    Turkish sources have said they believe Khashoggi was killed
inside the building and his body removed, allegations that
Riyadh dismisses as baseless.
    Macron said he would take a stance on the issue once the
facts were clear and that he would discuss it with Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al
Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
    France is closely diplomatically aligned with Saudi Arabia,
which welcomed Paris's tough stance in nuclear negotiations with
Iran and is broadly aligned with it on other Middle East
conflicts.
    Although France is one of the biggest suppliers of arms to
Riyadh, it was left out when Crown Prince Mohammed signed
business deals with the United States and Britain this year.
    In a sign of growing pressure, some media companies and
executives have pulled out of an investment conference in Saudi
planned for Oct. 23-25 over the Khashoggi affair. [nL8N1WM0RB] 
    However, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and a host
of French executives are all still due to attend.
    In talks with humanitarian groups in September, Macron said
he was sceptical of Prince Mohammed's reform agenda and that he
would not hesitate to question him if required, according to
people present.

 (Recasts with Schaeuble interview, Kurz remarks)
    By Jörn Poltz and Andrea Shalal
    MUNICH/BERLIN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's political standing has suffered in recent months and
poor results in two upcoming state elections could lead to
""bigger changes"", her long-time conservative ally, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, said on Friday.
    Schaeuble, a powerful former finance minister who now heads
the lower house of parliament, told the broadcaster SWR that
Merkel was likely be re-elected to lead the Christian Democrats
(CDU) at a December party congress if she ran - but did not rule
out the possibility that she might not stand.
    ""She is not as undisputed as she was over the last three
legislative periods,"" Schaeuble said, adding that regional
elections in Bavaria and Hesse this month would inevitably
affect her ""standing"".
    ""We know there are state elections before us. The results
are open. They can result in bigger changes,"" he said.
    Merkel, now in her fourth term, has been a popular and
formidable leader for 13 years.
    But support for her conservative bloc has waned since she
decided in 2015 to open the doors to over 1 million migrants,
boosting the far-right and forcing her this year to cobble
together a frail and loveless national coalition with the Social
Democrats.
    The decision also fuelled divisions with the CDU's Bavarian
sister party, the CSU, which on Sunday faces the prospect of its
worst showing in a state election in more than 60 years,
suffering, just like the CDU, from the surging anti-immigrant
Alternative for Germany (AfD).
    Polls suggest the CSU will win at most 35 percent, losing
the absolute majority that has allowed it to control Bavaria for
most of the post-war period, while the AfD is set to enter the
state assembly for the first time with up to 14 percent.
    The Munich-based manufacturer MTU Aero Engines <MTXGn.DE>
issued an unusual pre-election message to employees, urging them
to vote ""responsibly"" and shun populism, similar to local
guidance issued by the consulting firm EY.
    While stressing that it was not urging support for any one
party, MTU told employees in a letter: ""Germany, and especially
a strategically-orientated industry like ours, relies on stable
political conditions.""
    Reflecting the strains among conservatives, it was Austrian
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz who gave the keynote speech at a final
CSU rally in Munich on Friday, a spot traditionally reserved for
the CDU leader.
    Merkel's fourth and probably final government has twice come
close to collapsing - over immigration and a scandal over
Germany's former domestic spymaster - and now a debate over how
to phase out polluting diesel cars threatens to boil over.
    Polls also suggest the CDU will suffer heavy losses in the
state of Hesse on Oct. 28.

Bank policy is working as intended and the biggest risks to the
policy outlook are a sharp repricing of assets or a sudden rise
in interest rates, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Saturday.
    He said that specific risks include lingering stability
issues in the banking sector or a surprising increase in
inflation, which appears unlikely in the euro zone but a more
relevant issue in the United States.
    On the downside, a risk would be a ""snap back"" in rates
relating to geopolitical issues, such as trade tensions, a
renegotiation of EU rules by member nations or infringement on
central bank independence by governments, the ECB chief added.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank should keep its policy options open and not let itself be
influenced by the Federal Reserve, ECB policymaker Francois
Villeroy de Galhau said on Sunday.
    Encouraged by a recovery in euro zone inflation, the ECB
expects to stop adding to its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.0 trillion)
pile of bonds at the end of this year and has guided the market
to expect a rate hike some time in late 2019. 
    Villeroy said the ECB would soon decide how to reinvest the
proceeds of the bonds that expire next year but should not yet
commit beyond that point.
    ""We should keep our options open about the timing of our
reinvestment in the following years,"" he told a conference on
the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's annual
meeting in the Indonesian resort town of Nusa Dua.
    The French central bank governor added that rate-setters
should wait a little longer to clarify their guidance on
interest rates, which currently just says they will stay at
their current, rock-bottom level ""at least through the summer of
2019"".
    ""As we approach the summer of 2019, the balance will shift
in favour of detailing our forward guidance,"" Villeroy said.
    Six rate hikes by the Fed in 1-1/2 years have sent the U.S.
dollar rallying against the currencies of fragile emerging
economies such as Argentina and Turkey, forcing their central
banks to also increase borrowing costs to arrest the slide.
    The euro zone has been relatively insulated and Villeroy
said the ECB should proceed at its own pace.
    ""I think the euro area can determine its own course,"" he
said.

ministers should ""exert their collective authority"" to force a
change in her Brexit strategy, former Brexit minister David
Davis said on Sunday, stepping up pressure on Britain's leader.
    In an article in the Sunday Times newspaper, Davis again
pressed May to abandon her proposal for leaving the European
Union, saying the bloc ""has rejected it. The public does not
like it. Parliament will not vote for it"".
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU in
its biggest trade and foreign policy shift in more than 40
years, May is struggling to get backing for not only her vision
for future ties with the bloc but also over a so-called backstop
deal for Northern Ireland, one of the trickiest hurdles left.
    Talks with Brussels have been all but non-stop before a
summit on Wednesday when the two sides hope to agree a draft
withdrawal treaty to outline the divorce terms, including a
transition agreement and a solution to Northern Ireland.
    Davis, who again criticised the government of which he was
once part for accepting ""the EU's language on dealing with the
Northern Ireland border"" in December, said it was now up to the
so-called cabinet of top ministers to exert their influence.
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" Davis wrote.
    ""This week the authority of our constitution is on the
line.""
    Davis also said Britain should use the 39 billion pounds
Britain has agreed in a financial settlement with the EU as the
""biggest bargaining chip"" to secure a beneficial future trading
relationship with the bloc.

budget rules and must settle its differences with Brussels over
higher state spending in talks with the European Union's
executive, a senior International Monetary Fund official was
quoted on Sunday as saying.
    The comments by the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director
David Lipton to German business daily Handelsblatt came after
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi urged Italian
officials to stop questioning the euro.
    ""In our view, the Italian government should abide by the
European rules and agreements,"" Lipton said in an interview.
""The discussions on the draft budget must now be conducted
between Italy and the European Commission.""
    The Italian coalition has set a deficit target of 2.4
percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous goal
for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving investors and
prompting sharp criticism from the Commission. [nL8N1WP21C]
    Lipton warned that the budget dispute could delay planned
reforms to make the euro zone more resilient to external shocks.
""We hope that the further deepening of the monetary union will
not be hindered. We consider the completion of the Capital and
Banking Union to be very important,"" he said.
    A euro zone summit in December should bring progress on the
reform agenda, he added.
    Draghi said on Saturday that Italian officials need to ""calm
down"" in their budget debate as they have already caused damage
to firms and households. A senior member of the coalition
retorted that it was Draghi who should calm down. [nL2N1WT04J]
    Deeper euro zone integration has been championed by French
President Emmanuel Macron since his election last year, but has
run into opposition from Germany and its allies, wary of sharing
more responsibility with less fiscally prudent governments.
    EU leaders agreed in June that the ESM bailout fund should
play a bigger role in a more integrated euro zone, but left the
details to December and difficult issues such as a euro zone
budget or deposit insurance scheme until an unspecified future
date. [nL8N1TV3AV]

    BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Brexit negotiators have
yet to seal a deal on Britain's divorce terms, EU officials said
on Sunday, after a flurry of meetings in Brussels to try to move
the talks forward before Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for
a summit later this week.
    With less than six months until Britain leaves the European
Union, Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab met EU negotiator
Michel Barnier and the ambassadors of the 27 other member states
were separately summoned to a meeting.
    But despite some reports, senior EU sources said
negotiations had yet to produce a final deal for leaders to
approve this week, and some signalled that more meetings would
be necessary to get agreement on the withdrawal terms.
    Raab had raced to Brussels after the two sides ""jointly
agreed that face-to-face talks were necessary"" on the ""big
issues still to resolve"". 
    One of those was a ""backstop"" to prevent a return to
controls on the border between the British province of Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland. This arrangement has strengthened
opposition to May's plans after her Northern Irish allies
accused the bloc of trying to annex the province. [nL8N1WT09H]
    Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy for
decades is also dividing the prime minister's Conservative
Party, with critics, such as Raab's predecessor, pressing May to
change her strategy.
    David Davis, who resigned as Brexit minister in July,
accused the government on Sunday of accepting ""the EU's language
on dealing with the Northern Ireland border"".
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" wrote Davis, who
campaigned for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
    ""This week the authority of our constitution is on the
line,"" he said in an article in the Sunday Times.
    Davis also pressed May to abandon her Brexit proposal, which
involves staying in a free trade zone with the EU for
manufactured and agricultural goods. The bloc ""has rejected it.
The public does not like it. Parliament will not vote for it,""
he wrote.
    
    LOBBYING
    So far, May has shown little appetite to change tack, 
trying to persuade Conservative lawmakers and those in the
opposition Labour Party to vote for any deal based on her plan.
    Lobbying of May from all sides has increased in recent weeks
as London and Brussels edge closer to an agreement on a draft
withdrawal treaty to cover the divorce terms, a transition
period and a solution for Northern Ireland.
    Preventing any return of a ""hard"" border in Ireland has
become one of the major obstacles, with Brexit campaigners
fearful that a backstop with expiry date will keep Britain
inside a customs union with the EU indefinitely.
    May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop
must be temporary, but the EU has refused to set an end date.
    Health minister Matt Hancock suggested the backstop could be
temporary without such a date, an argument that may fall flat
with some eurosceptic lawmakers who are calling for May to
""chuck Chequers"", her Brexit plan named after her country
residence.
    ""There are different ways to ensure that something is time
limited,"" Hancock told the BBC. ""For instance, you can set
conditions at the point at which the arrangements come to an
end.""
    Even if May reaches a withdrawal agreement, she will
struggle to get it through parliament and may find opposition
from the small Northern Irish party which props up here minority
government to other legislation such as the budget. [nL8N1WQ41Q]
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' but the dangers
of a bad deal are worse,"" Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic
Unionist Party, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules
made in a place where we have no say.""

    LISBON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Portugal's prime minister
announced a reshuffle of his cabinet on Sunday, following the
resignation of the defence minister and completion of the draft
of next year's budget, making changes at four ministries ahead
of a general election in 2019.
    Cabinet Minister Pedro Siza Vieira, a lawyer who joined the
government a year ago, will serve as the new economy minister,
replacing Manuel Caldeira Cabral.
    Joao Gomes Cravinho, the European Union's ambassador to
Brazil, will take over from outgoing Defence Minister Jose
Azeredo Lopes, who resigned on Friday amid an investigation into
a suspected cover-up of an arms theft from a military depot.
[nL8N1WS52C]      
    This is the biggest cabinet reshuffle since Prime Minister
Antonio Costa's minority Socialist government came to power in
2015 and aims to bolster the administration going into next
year's election. The Socialists lead in opinion polls with about
40 percent support.
    Costa said in a statement the reshuffle ""reinforces economic
policy at the centre of government and prioritises the
transition of energy (use) to mitigate climatic change.""
    Siza Vieira joined the government a year ago from the law
firm Linklaters and will continue as cabinet minister as well as
economy minister. The powerful economy ministry has recently
gained further importance thanks to surging foreign investment
and strong economic growth.
    The reshuffle comes after the government approved this
weekend the 2019 draft budget which will be presented to
parliament on Monday.
    The Socialist government has overseen a strong economic
recovery since Portugal's 2011-14 debt crisis with policies to
ease austerity measures, boost foreign investment and spur a
fledgling technology sector.  
    The reshuffle also includes the transfer of responsibility
for the energy sector to the environment ministry from the
economy ministry, indicating a stronger emphasis on clean
energy.
    Portugal produces a large part of its energy from
hydro-electric power and is boosting other alternative energy
sources such as solar and wind.     
    The other changes include the appointment of Graca Maria da
Fonseca as the new minister of culture after working as
secretary of state for administrative modernisation.
    Marta Temido, who previously headed the central
administration of the public health system, will take over as
health minister.
    President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has to approve the
nominations, said in a statement the new ministers would
be sworn in on Monday.

    By Gabriela Baczynska, Alastair Macdonald and Elizabeth
Piper
    BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Brexit negotiators have
yet to seal a deal on Britain's divorce terms, officials said,
after a flurry of meetings in Brussels on Sunday to try to
secure a draft agreement before Prime Minister Theresa May
arrives for a summit this week.
    With less than six months until Britain leaves the European
Union, Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab met EU negotiator
Michel Barnier and the ambassadors of the 27 other member states
were separately summoned to a meeting.
    But senior EU sources said a final deal had yet to be agreed
for leaders to approve this week, with some adding that the EU's
timetable before Wednesday's summit would now have to shift. A 
meeting of EU advisers was postponed from Monday to make way for
more talks. [nB5N1U6019] [nL8N1WU0QE] 
    Raab had raced to Brussels after the two sides ""jointly
agreed that face-to-face talks were necessary"" on the ""big
issues still to resolve"". 
    One of those was a ""backstop"" to prevent a return to
controls on the border between the British province of Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland. This arrangement has strengthened
opposition to May's plans after her Northern Irish allies
accused the bloc of trying to annex the province. [nL8N1WT09H]
    Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy for
decades is also dividing the prime minister's Conservative
Party, with critics, such as Raab's predecessor, pressing May to
change her strategy.
    David Davis, who resigned as Brexit minister in July,
accused the government on Sunday of accepting ""the EU's language
on dealing with the Northern Ireland border"".
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" wrote Davis, who
campaigned for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
    ""This week the authority of our constitution is on the
line,"" he said in an article in the Sunday Times.
    Davis also pressed May to abandon her Brexit proposal, which
involves staying in a free trade zone with the EU for
manufactured and agricultural goods. The bloc ""has rejected it.
The public does not like it. Parliament will not vote for it,""
he wrote.
    
    LOBBYING
    So far, May has shown little appetite to change tack, 
trying to persuade Conservative lawmakers and those in the
opposition Labour Party to vote for any deal based on her plan.
    But lobbying of May from all sides has increased in recent
weeks as London and Brussels edge closer to an agreement on a
draft withdrawal treaty to cover the divorce terms, a transition
period and a solution for Northern Ireland.
    Preventing any return of a ""hard"" border in Ireland has
become one of the major obstacles, with Brexit campaigners
fearful that a backstop with no expiry date will keep Britain
inside a customs union with the EU indefinitely.
    May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop
must be temporary, but the EU has refused to set an end date.
    Health minister Matt Hancock suggested the backstop could be
temporary without such a date, an argument that may fall flat
with some eurosceptic lawmakers who are calling for May to
""chuck Chequers"", her Brexit plan named after her country
residence.
    ""There are different ways to ensure that something is time
limited,"" Hancock told the BBC. ""For instance, you can set
conditions at the point at which the arrangements come to an
end.""
    Even if May reaches a withdrawal agreement, she will
struggle to get it through parliament and may find opposition
from the small Northern Irish party which props up here minority
government to other legislation such as the budget. [nL8N1WQ41Q]
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' but the dangers
of a bad deal are worse,"" Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic
Unionist Party, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules
made in a place where we have no say.""

    By Gabriela Baczynska, Alastair Macdonald and Elizabeth
Piper
    BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The stubborn problem of
Britain's land border with Ireland thwarted a drive to clinch a
Brexit deal before a European Union summit this week, as
negotiators admitted defeat after marathon talks and pressed
pause for the coming days.
    EU negotiator Michel Barnier said after meeting British
Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that they could still not bridge a
gap between his ""backstop"" demands that Northern Ireland stay in
the EU's economic zone if there is a risk that border checks
with EU member Ireland could revive conflict, and London's
rejection of any checks on trade between the province and the
British mainland. 
    Both sides want to end more than a year of talks by
mid-November. This is to give parliaments in London and Brussels
time to approve a deal before Britain otherwise crashes out of
the EU next March, plunging businesses and millions of ordinary
citizens into a chaotic and costly legal limbo. 
    However, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces intense
opposition to some of the EU's demands from members of her
Conservative party and allies in Northern Ireland, some of whom
threaten to reject any deal they do not like in parliament. 
    ""Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open,
including the backstop for (Ireland/Northern Ireland) to avoid a
hard border,"" Barnier tweeted after his meeting in Brussels with
Raab ended days of bargaining between Barnier's deputy Sabine
Weyand and May's Brexit lieutenant Oliver Robbins.
    A British government spokesman said progress had been made
in some key areas. ""However there remain a number of unresolved
issues relating to the backstop. The UK is still committed to
making progress at the October European Council,"" he said.
    But the result, EU officials and diplomats said, is that
there are no plans for further talks before leaders of the other
27 EU member states meet over dinner in Brussels on Wednesday to
hear Barnier brief them on the state of play. 
    Several said there was little chance the leaders would give
Barnier new instructions. They noted this puts the onus on May,
who will join the leaders on Thursday morning, to break the 
deadlock she faces among her own allies and supporters.
    ""It seems like May doesn't have backing in her cabinet for
the backstop,"" said one senior EU diplomat who was briefed by
Barnier.
    Both sides had for a time been talking up progress but many
Brussels diplomats and officials have questioned whether May
could appear to come to terms quite so quickly. More days, or
weeks, of drama could strengthen her hand as both sides talk up
preparations for a possible ""no-deal"" Brexit.
    Leaders had been due to decide on Wednesday whether enough
progress had been made for them to agree to hold another summit,
pencilled in for Nov. 17-18, at which both the treaty on an
orderly British withdrawal and a vaguer document setting out
future trade relations could be inked in.
    It is unclear now whether the leaders will call for the
November summit this week. Many, notably French President
Emmanuel Macron, made clear at a summit with May last month that
they would agree to meet only if she could show she had come
sufficiently close to a deal to make it worthwhile.
    EU sources said Barnier's team have offered new wording on a
text on the backstop, highlighting that it may never be
activated or only for a limited time, and also that Britain as a
whole could stay under EU rules for longer as it transitions out
after March 2019. But so far that has not met British
reservations.
    Both sides want to avoid renewed checks on what will become
their only land border to avoid hindering trade on the island of
Ireland and reawakening tensions two decades after a peace deal
ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
    
    FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS     
    David Davis, who resigned as Brexit minister in July,
accused May's government earlier on Sunday of accepting ""the
EU's language on dealing with the Northern Ireland border"".
    ""This is one of the most fundamental decisions that
government has taken in modern times. It is time for cabinet
members to exert their collective authority,"" Davis, who
campaigned for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum,
wrote in the Sunday Times.
    Davis also pressed May to abandon her Brexit proposal, which
involves staying in a free trade zone with the EU for goods. 
    So far, May has shown little appetite to change tack, 
trying to persuade Conservative lawmakers and those in the
opposition Labour Party to vote for any deal based on her plan.
    Even if she reaches a withdrawal agreement, she will
struggle to get it through parliament and may find opposition
from the small Northern Irish party which props up here minority
government to other legislation such as the budget. [nL8N1WQ41Q]
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' but the dangers
of a bad deal are worse,"" Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic
Unionist Party, wrote in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules

    * Support for junior coalition partner SPD halved
    * Results seen as vote against grand coalition

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Germany woke up on Monday to the
news that its crisis-prone government could become even more
unstable after the parties ruling in a loveless coalition
suffered humiliating results in an election in the southern
state of Bavaria.
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies slumped to their
worst election results in almost 70 years and her junior
coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), saw
support in Bavaria halved.
    ""It's gonna be turbulent,"" headlined the Die Welt newspaper.
""The result in Bavaria is a vote against the grand coalition in
Berlin.""
    The SPD had hoped that infighting over immigration between
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian
Social Union (CDU) allies would give them a boost in Bavaria.
    But instead, the party saw support fall to just under 10
percent, prompting a discussion over the sustainability of its
alliance with Merkel's conservatives at the national level.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
 join a Merkel-led government after vowing before the general
election in September 2017 to sit in opposition if they lost to
the conservatives. They are now demanding consequences.
    The party's General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told
Deutschlandfunk radio that members  wanted a change in the style
of government.
    SPD leaders have promised members opposed to a coalition
with the conservatives they will hold a review after two-years
in government and decide whether the partnership was still
viable.
    Asked if disgruntled SPD members were demanding that the
review be brought forward, Klingbeil said:
    ""The evaluation is planned for the middle of the legislative
period but something must happen now. There must be different
style of government.""
    He said the CSU under Horst Seehofer must stop picking
arguments, especially on issues like migrant policy. ""If the
style of government doesn't change, there will be a debate in
the SPD and the critical voices will get stronger,"" he said.
    Polls indicate that the ruling parties will be chastened
again in two weeks in an election in the western state of Hesse,
where they are expected to bleed support to the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the ecologist Greens.
    The state is ruled by Merkel's CDU in a coalition with the
Greens and a slump in support for the conservatives there would
almost certainly further weaken her authority.
    ""If the CDU loses the government in Hesse, this will
probably start a discussion within the CDU about Merkel's
position,"" wrote mass-selling Bild.

3.6 percent on the year in September up from 3.5 percent due to
increase of prices of fuels, services and food, data from the
statistics office showed on Monday.
    Consumer price inflation was 0.3 percent on the month in
September, compared to 0.1 percent a month earlier, mainly due
to higher food prices, including bread, the office said.
    Under the EU-harmonised index, where non-food prices have
more weight, consumer prices rose 3.6 percent on the year in
August and dropped 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
    The finance ministry has increased forecast for
EU-harmonised annual inflation to 3.4 percent at the end of 2018
from previous 1.9 percent, mainly due to higher global oil
prices. It sees inflation easing to 2.6 percent at the end of
2019.

failing banks intends to hold  nearly 33 billion euros ($38.18
billion) in 2019, up from 25 billions this year, the head of the
agency that manages the fund said on Monday.
    The move is in line with plans to gradually increase the
Single Resolution Fund to at least 1 percent of all covered
deposits in euro zone banks by the end of 2023, which is
estimated to be between 55 billion and 60 billion euros.
    ""The SRF will continue to grow to just short of 33 billion
in 2019. The amounts will be invested to ensure value protection
and high liquidity,"" Elke Koenig, who chairs the Single
Resolution Board, told a banking conference in Brussels.
    The fund is financed by euro zone banks and is meant to help
failing lenders, and reduce costs for taxpayers when banks fail.
    Euro zone states are discussing establishing a safety net
for the SRF that would allow the fund to intervene in a major
crisis with more than one large bank in trouble.
    Details of the so-called SRF backstop are due to be
finalised in December.
    EU leaders agreed in June to give the state rescue fund, the
European Stability Mechanism, more powers to help the banking
fund [nL8N1TV3AV].
    Once allowed to act as a backstop, the ESM could offer a
revolving credit line of the same size as the bank fund.

    * May due in Brussels for summit on Wednesday
    * EU 'treating us with naked contempt' - Johnson

    By Amanda Ferguson and Elizabeth Piper
    BELFAST/LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister
Theresa May was under mounting pressure on Monday to rethink her
plan for leaving the European Union after Brexit talks reached a
stand-off at the weekend over the so-called Irish backstop.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc and days
before May heads to Brussels for a summit on Wednesday when both
sides hope to make progress, the Brexit talks were paused on
Sunday after the two sides failed to agree on how to deal with
the United Kingdom's only land border with the EU.
    The problem of how to prevent the return of a hard border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member
Ireland has become the biggest hurdle to a deal on Brexit,
Britain's biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years.
    May, a self-declared unionist who has said repeatedly that
she could not countenance the breakup of the United Kingdom, is
struggling to find a way to satisfy the demands of not only the
EU, but of her Conservative Party and her partners in
parliament, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    For now, there has been little success in narrowing the gap
between those competing demands, and Ireland's Foreign Minister
Simon Coveney said any deal would now ""take a bit more time than
many people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    The DUP, which has threatened to pull support from the
government over the backstop row, said it now believed a no-deal
Brexit was almost inevitable and described the talks in Brussels
as turning into a ""battle for the union"".
    ""Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner
they've put Theresa May into, there's no deal which I can see at
present which will command a majority in the House of Commons,""
said the party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson.
    ""So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a
no-deal scenario,"" he told the Belfast News Letter.
    May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, the figurehead
of Britain's Brexit campaign and one of the bookmakers'
favourites to replace May, was equally critical, saying the
talks were ""now entering the moment of crisis"". [nL8N1WU10R]
    ""In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of
the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt,""
he wrote in his weekly column in the Telegraph newspaper.
    ""It is time to scrap the backstop.""
    
    BACKSTOP TO A BACKSTOP
    It was that kind of opposition which made it impossible for
May's Brexit minister Dominic Raab to agree to a deal in
Brussels on Sunday.
    British officials said London could not agree to Brussels'
demand to have ""a backstop to a backstop"", which would see the
EU's proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the bloc's customs
union if a new trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Britain has long said it wants an agreement on a future
relationship with the EU, which London sees as including a
common rule book for manufactured and agricultural products,
which would negate any need for a backstop plan for Ireland.
    But EU negotiators have criticised that proposal, and said
on Sunday it was clear that, as things stood, May did not feel
she could get a deal through her cabinet of ministers, who will
meet on Tuesday.
    EU officials and diplomats say they will ""keep calm and
carry on"", hoping May can sort out her problems in London. 
    British officials were optimistic of making some progress at
the EU summit this week, with foreign minister Jeremy Hunt
telling reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are one or two very
difficult outstanding issues but I think we can get there.
Whether we do this week or not, who knows? But I know everyone
is trying incredibly hard.""
    But any solution to the border question looked far off.
Ireland again said Britain must make good on its commitment to
have a backstop plan. [nL8N1WV201]
    ""For us we want to see an outcome here that settles nerves,
that allows us to move ahead with a managed, sensible Brexit,""
Ireland's Coveney told reporters. 
    ""I still think it's possible to do that, but clearly it's
going to take a bit more time than many people had hoped.""

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tricky initial
public offerings require buoyant investors. With interest rates
and trade-war tensions rising, and Brexit looming, IPO
procrastinators may have missed their window. 
    Spanish oil group Cepsa <CPF.GQ>  on Monday became the
latest market hopeful to put its stock market debut on hold. It
joined Dutch car-leasing company LeasePlan [AAHALP.UL], which
was seeking a 7.5 billion euro price tag according to Bloomberg,
but last week said it would not proceed “due to market
conditions”. Chinese streaming service Tencent Music
Entertainment has also pressed pause on plans to raise $2
billion in a U.S. listing until equity markets have stabilised,
Reuters reported.
    Blaming markets is far from a catch-all excuse, though.
German brake maker Knorr Bremse <KBX.DE>  last week raised 3.9
billion euros with an offering priced in the middle of the
expected range; the shares are up slightly since. Shares in
Shurgard <SHUR.BR>, a self-storage group that priced its
Brussels IPO near the bottom of the range, rose about 5 percent
on its first hours of trading on Monday. And French solar power
specialist Neoen’s <NEOEN.PA>  offering was snapped up in a day,
according to a person familiar with the matter, after it pitched
shares at the lower end of its initial range. The lesson is
that, even in turbulent times, investors will support
modestly-priced companies with business models that are easy to
understand. 
    Yet prospective shareholders will use a bigger magnifying
glass when examining harder-to-value prospects. While Tencent
Music has a listed peer in Spotify <SPOT.N>, its strategy for
getting listeners to pay for music in piracy-heavy China is
unclear. LeasePlan struggled to reassure investors who were
worried that corporate clients would slash spending on company
cars in the next recession. Cepsa owner Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi
state investor, was seeking proceeds of 2 billion euros at a
valuation premium to Spanish rival Repsol <REP.MC>, based on
Breakingviews calculations.
    The trio may have missed the boat for a while. Europe’s
STOXX 50 index has not yet recovered from a worldwide market
rout on Oct. 10. So long as the Federal Reserve keeps tightening
monetary policy, higher bond yields are probably here to stay.
Add U.S.-China trade tensions and the fallout from a possible
no-deal Brexit next year, and it’s hard to imagine investors
taking a punt on dicey IPOs for some time.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Spain's Cepsa on Oct. 15 postponed its planned initial
public offering. Owner Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi state investor,
had planned to raise about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) by
selling 25 percent of the company.
    - ""The most recent international economic developments have
sowed considerable uncertainty in international capital
markets,"" Cepsa said in a statement. 
    - ""In this scenario, the appetite of international investors
has retracted significantly, along with their willingness to
participate in stock market listings such as the one being
carried out by Cepsa,"" it said.
    - The previous week Tencent Music Entertainment, the owner
of China's most popular music app, delayed a U.S. share offering
according to an Oct. 12 Reuters report citing three sources. 
    - Dutch car-leasing company LeasePlan also shelved plans to
float in Amsterdam, blaming a global selloff in equity markets.
    - Shares in Knorr-Bremse, a German brake maker, closed at
81.64 euros on Oct. 12, its first day of trading. Its IPO was
priced at 80 euros. 
    - Amsterdam-listed self-storage group Shurgard was trading
at 24.06 euros at 0810 GMT on Oct. 15, compared with an IPO
price of 23 euros.

one single country, Lithuania's foreign minister said on Monday,
as Italy came under pressure from a group of EU members states
to back the proposal.
    Seven EU countries including Britain, the Netherlands and
Lithuania are pushing for the EU to be able to impose sanctions
more quickly on specific individuals anywhere in the world,
freezing their assets in the bloc and banning them from entry,
according to an EU document obtained by Reuters.
    Russia has made cyber and electronic warfare a key part of
its military operations, Western officials say, and Britain, the
Netherlands and the United States have accused Moscow of
conducting a global campaign of computer hacks against the West.
[nL8N1WK35D]
    But Rome, where the anti-establishment government wants to
have better ties with Russia, fears the sanctions would alienate
Moscow and it opposes the EU plan, according to a confidential
document seen by Reuters.
    ""We would not target a single geography. This is not against
Russia by default,"" Lithuania's Linas Linkevicius told Reuters
before a meeting with other EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. 
    ""If Russia attacks us, we will target Russia. If someone
else attacks us, then we will target them,"" he said.
    Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's co-ruling far-right
League, has expressed his admiration for Russian President
Vladimir Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling
in Western elections.
    Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will try to reassure
his Italian counterpart Enzo Moavero Milanesi on Monday that the
proposal, which London hopes to have agreed before it leaves the
EU next March, is not against Russia, diplomats said.    
    Belgium, Sweden and Poland are also broadly in favour but
want more discussion, a second internal document showed. EU
diplomats hope EU leaders could back the sanctions plan in their
final statement at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
    ""It is only a matter of time before we are hit by a critical
operation with severe consequences on the EU and member states,""
the three-page proposal document said, urging action on cyber
defences which have been under discussion since 2015.
    ""We need to be ready to respond,"" it said.
    EU and NATO diplomats believe China and North Korea, as well
as Russia, have developed sophisticated computer hacking weapons
and cybersurveillance software to spy on and undermine the West,
often using criminal groups to mask the origin of such attacks.
    The EU cyber regime plan follows a similar sanctions
mechanism formally agreed by ministers on Monday to punish
chemical weapons' attacks by targeting people blamed for using
banned munitions regardless of their nationality. [nL8N1WA1XJ]

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Bavarian sister party said on Monday it would back political
stability in Berlin after suffering big losses in a regional
election which their far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake""
that would rock the coalition government.
    The conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) slumped to its
worst election result in almost 70 years in Sunday's election in
Bavaria and Merkel's other coalition partner, the centre-left
Social Democrats (SPD) saw their support halve. [nL8N1WU02P]
    CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who is also interior minister in
Merkel's loveless coalition, had hoped his anti-immigration
rhetoric and criticism of Merkel's liberal asylum policies would
help his party fend off a threat from the far-right in Bavaria.
    But his strategy backfired as the CSU, which has ruled
Bavaria for almost six decades, bled votes to the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the ecologist Greens in
equal measure.
    ""We will do our bit to ensure that the coalition can
continue to do its work in a stable manner despite some of the
comments that were made yesterday,"" Seehofer told reporters.
    He was referring to angry CSU delegates who blamed their
party's dismal showing on Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome
some one million, mainly Muslim, asylum seekers, which has
fuelled the rise of the AfD.
    Asked if his leadership of the CSU was in question, Seehofer
said he would not discuss personnel matters in his party.
    The AfD gleefully seized on the Bavarian election outcome as
a sign of a broader, national malaise with Merkel's coalition,
which has been shaken by a series of disputes, including over
immigration, since it took power just seven months ago.
    ""We are very pleased because the goal for the Bavaria state
election was to send an earthquake towards Berlin,"" Martin
Sichert, AfD leader in Bavaria, told a news conference. ""This
earthquake happened ... we are now excited to see what the
consequences will be here in Berlin.""
    The CSU also lost support to the Free Voters, a protest
party of mainly conservative independents.
    In Bavaria, the CSU will now try to form a coalition either
with the Free Voters - its preferred option - or with the Greens
who are ideologically distant.
    
    ""PAINFUL""
    Germany's ruling coalition was borne of necessity rather
than choice after an inconclusive general election in September
2017.
    The Bavarian election was also a wake-up call for the SPD,
which saw its support halve to just under 10 percent, prompting
a discussion over the sustainability of its alliance at national
level with Merkel's conservative bloc.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
 join the Merkel-led government in Berlin after vowing before
the 2017 election to sit in opposition if they lost to the
conservatives. They are now demanding consequences.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles blamed her party's bad fortune in
Bavaria on infighting between Merkel's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) and Seehofer's CSU at national level.
    ""It is obvious that the whole style of our cooperation must
change,"" she told reporters. ""One state election alone, as
painful as it is, does not answer the question of whether the
grand coalition is working. We urgently need to work on the
style and communication and also on substantive progress."" 
    Polls suggest the ruling parties will again be punished in
two weeks' time in an election in the western state of Hesse,
where they are expected to lose voters to the AfD and the
Greens.
    The state is ruled by Merkel's CDU in a coalition with the
Greens and a slump in support for the conservatives there would
almost certainly further weaken the chancellor's authority.
    Merkel, who has been in power since 2005 and is Europe's
most powerful leader, then faces further potential pitfalls in
the form of a CDU conclave and the party's annual congress in
early December.
    The 64-year-old Merkel has won support from key
conservatives in her bid  for re-election as CDU chairwoman at
the congress. But this could change if the CDU loses Hesse to an
SPD-Greens coalition.
    ""If the CDU loses the government in Hesse, this will
probably start a discussion within the CDU about Merkel's
position,"" wrote mass-selling Bild.

 (Adds May's spokesman, EU diplomats)
    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will face mounting pressure on Monday to rethink her plan
for leaving the European Union after Brexit talks reached a
stand-off at the weekend over the so-called Irish backstop.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc and days
before May heads to Brussels for a summit on Wednesday when both
sides hope to make progress, the Brexit talks were paused on
Sunday after the two sides failed to agree on how to deal with
the United Kingdom's only land border with the EU.
    May was to make a statement to parliament later on Monday.
    The talks stumbled over how to prevent the return of a hard
border between the British province of Northern Ireland and
EU-member Ireland after Britain leaves in its biggest shift in
policy for more than 40 years. 
    May, who has said repeatedly that she could not countenance
the breakup of the United Kingdom, is struggling to find a way
to satisfy the demands of not only the EU, but of her
Conservative Party and her partners in parliament, Northern
Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    There has been little success in narrowing the gap between
those competing demands, and Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon
Coveney said any deal would now ""take a bit more time than many
people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    But a spokesman for May said there were ""a number of means
of achieving what we want to achieve"" on the backstop. He
declined to give details and repeated Britain's view that any
such arrangement would be time-limited.[nS8N1U8006]
    ""We are not going to be stuck permanently in single customs
territory unable to do meaningful trade deals,"" he said.
    At the weekend, EU diplomats said London had urged Brussels
to accept assurances that Britain would effectively stay in a
customs union with the bloc to make the backstop unnecessary.
The EU said it would need an insurance policy. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    Much will depend on whether May can sell any deal to her
Conservative Party and the DUP, which has threatened to pull
support from the government if she agrees to different rules for
the province.
    
    BACKSTOP TO A BACKSTOP
    Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, said it now
believed a no-deal Brexit was almost inevitable and described
the talks in Brussels as turning into a ""battle for the union"".
    ""Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner
they've put Theresa May into, there's no deal which I can see at
present which will command a majority in the House of Commons,""
Wilson told the Belfast News Letter.
    May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, the figurehead
of Britain's Brexit campaign and one of the bookmakers'
favourites to replace May, was equally critical.
    ""In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of
the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt,""
he wrote in the Telegraph newspaper. [nL8N1WU10R]
    It was that kind of opposition which made it impossible for
May's Brexit minister Dominic Raab to agree to a deal in
Brussels on Sunday.
    British officials said London could not agree to Brussels'
demand to have ""a backstop to a backstop"", which would see the
EU's proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the bloc's customs
union if a new trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Britain has long said it wants an agreement on a future
relationship with the EU, which London sees as including a
common rule book for manufactured and agricultural products,
which would negate any need for a backstop plan for Ireland.
    But British negotiators also say they will honour a
commitment to a backstop. This year, the government suggested
Britain could apply the EU's external tariffs for a limited
period in case of any delay in implementing a Brexit deal.
    EU negotiators have criticised that proposal, and said on
Sunday it was clear that, as things stood, May did not feel she
could get a deal through her cabinet, which meets on Tuesday.
    EU officials and diplomats say they will ""keep calm and
carry on"", hoping May can sort out her problems in London. 
    British officials were optimistic of making some progress at
the EU summit this week, with foreign minister Jeremy Hunt
telling reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are one or two very
difficult outstanding issues but I think we can get there.
Whether we do this week or not, who knows? But I know everyone
is trying incredibly hard.""

    MADRID, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Spain's government trimmed growth
forecasts for this year and next on Monday as part of the 2019
budget proposal, mostly due to slowing exports, the Economy
Minister Nadia Calvino said.
    Spain's economic output has grown more than 3 percent each
year for the last three years and has been expanding ever since
it emerged from a 5-year economic slump in 2013.
    However, slowing exports, rising oil prices and political
uncertainties over trade are expected to weigh on the recovery
this year and next, Calvino said.
    The 2019 budget proposal, which will be sent to Brussels on
Monday, has been agreed between the minority Socialist
government and the anti-austerity party Podemos. 
    The proposal still needs support from regional parties in
parliament to be passed into law. [nL8N1WR24E]
    The government expects economic output to expand by 2.6
percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent,
and by 2.3 percent next year after a previous forecast of 2.4
percent, Calvino said. 
    The government left the budget deficit forecast unchanged
from targets set in July at 2.7 percent of gross domestic
product this year and 1.8 percent of GDP in 2019. 
    The proposal aims to raise the spending ceiling by 4.4
percent from a year earlier to 125.1 billion euros ($145
billion), the highest since 2015. 
    The budget aims to cut the unemployment rate, the second
highest in Europe after Greece, to 15.5 percent this year and
13.8 percent next year, compared with 15.3 percent recorded in
the second quarter.

 (Adds Merkel comments)
    By Elizabeth Piper and William James
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May faces growing pressure on Monday to rethink her plan for
leaving the European Union after Brexit talks reached a
stand-off at the weekend over the so-called Irish backstop.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc and
before May heads on Wednesday to Brussels for a summit when both
sides still hope to make progress, the Brexit talks were paused
on Sunday after the two sides failed to agree on how to deal
with the United Kingdom's only land border with the EU.
    May was to make a statement to parliament later on Monday
after the weekend talks stumbled over how to prevent the return
of a hard border between the British province of Northern
Ireland and EU-member Ireland when Britain leaves in its biggest
shift in policy for more than 40 years. 
    May, who has said repeatedly that she could not countenance
the breakup of the United Kingdom, is struggling to find a way
to satisfy the demands of not only the EU, but of her
Conservative Party and her partners in parliament, Northern
Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    There has been little success in narrowing that gap, and
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said any deal would now
""take a bit more time than many people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said she had been ""very
hopeful"" that a deal on Britain's exit could be achieved but ""at
the moment it actually looks a bit more difficult"". [nS8N1WO01N]
    But a spokesman for May held out hope, saying there were ""a
number of means of achieving what we want to achieve"" on the
backstop. He declined to give details and repeated Britain's
view that any such arrangement would be
time-limited.[nS8N1U8006]
    ""We need to be able to look the British people in the eye
and say the backstop is a temporary solution,"" he said. ""We are
not going to be stuck permanently in a single customs territory
unable to do meaningful trade deals.""
    At the weekend, EU sources said London had offered exactly
that and urged Brussels to accept assurances that Britain would
effectively stay in a customs union to make the backstop
unnecessary. The EU said it would still need an insurance
policy. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    
    BACKSTOP TO A BACKSTOP
    Much will depend on whether May can sell any deal to her
Conservative Party and the DUP, which has threatened to pull
support from the government if she agrees to different rules for
the province.
    Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, said it now
believed a no-deal Brexit was almost inevitable and described
the talks in Brussels as turning into a ""battle for the union"".
    May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, the figurehead
of Britain's Brexit campaign and one of the bookmakers'
favourites to replace May, was equally critical.
    ""In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of
the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt,""
he wrote in the Telegraph newspaper. [nL8N1WU10R]
    It was that kind of opposition which made it impossible for
May's Brexit minister Dominic Raab to agree to a deal in
Brussels on Sunday.
    British officials said London could not agree to Brussels'
demand to have ""a backstop to a backstop"", which upheld the EU's
proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the bloc's customs union if
a new trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Britain has long said it wants an agreement on a future
relationship with the EU, which London sees as including a
common rule book for manufactured and agricultural products,
which would negate any need for a backstop plan for Ireland.
    But British negotiators also say they will honour a
commitment to a backstop. This year, the government suggested
Britain could apply the EU's external tariffs for a limited
period in case of any delay in implementing a Brexit deal.
    EU negotiators have criticised that proposal, and said on
Sunday it was clear that, as things stood, May did not feel she
could get a deal through her cabinet, which meets on Tuesday.
    EU officials and diplomats say they will ""keep calm and
carry on"", hoping May can sort out her problems in London. 
    Some British officials were optimistic of making progress at
the EU summit this week, with foreign minister Jeremy Hunt
telling reporters in Luxembourg: ""There are one or two very
difficult outstanding issues but I think we can get there.""
    ""Whether we do this week or not, who knows? But I know
everyone is trying incredibly hard.""

    ATHENS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Greece's central government
achieved a primary budget surplus of 4.8 billion euros in the
first nine months of the year, well above target, thanks to
higher revenues and lower spending, finance ministry data showed
on Monday.
    The government was targeting a primary budget surplus --
which excludes debt-servicing costs -- of 2.52 billion euros for
the January-to-September period, meaning the surplus
outperformed the target by 2.29 billion euros.
    The central government surplus excludes the budgets of
social security funds and local administration. It differs from
the figure monitored by Greece's EU/IMF lenders but indicates
the state of the country's finances.
    Net tax revenue came in at 37.23 billion euros, 591 million
euros above target, while spending reached 36.93 billion euros,
1.54 million euros below target.
    The government projects a primary budget surplus of 3.8
percent of economic output this year, according to its 2018
budget. The bailout target is for a primary surplus of 3.5
percent of GDP.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/London-October 15: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Gothaer 
Allgemeine Versicherung AG's (GA) and Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG's (GL) 
Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings at 'A' (Strong) and Long-Term Issuer 
Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A-'. The Outlooks are Stable.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The affirmation reflects GA's and GL's (together Gothaer) strong and resilient 
capitalisation, strong financial performance and well-diversified business mix. 
These strengths are offset by the adverse impact of continuing low interest 
rates due to the duration gap between life insurance investments and life 
liabilities.

Fitch views Gothaer's capitalisation as strong and supportive of the group's 
ratings. This view is supported by Gothaer's Fitch Prism Factor-Based Model 
(Prism FBM) score of 'Strong' at end-2017. We expect the score to be maintained 
at end-2018. At end-2017, Gothaer reported a group Solvency II (S2) coverage 
ratio of 186% (2016: 140%), excluding the benefit of transitional measures on 
technical provisions. We expect Gothaer's S2 ratio to remain stable in 2018.

Gothaer's net income continued to improve in 2017 to EUR168 million, from EUR158 
million in 2016. This was mainly driven by an improved underwriting result in 
the non-life segment, which is reflected in Gothaer's strong net combined ratios 
in recent years. The net combined ratio in 2017 was 95.1%, compared with 99.8% 
in 2013. For 2018, we expect the combined ratio to deteriorate due to the 
increased loss claims from windstorm Friederike, but to remain under 100%. 

Life results remained affected by the negative effects of low interest rates, 
which were partly offset by improved underwriting results. Charges stemming from 
the need to fund additional regulatory reserving requirements 
(Zinszusatzreserve, ZZR) totalled EUR243 million in 2017, which were mainly 
financed by realisation of capital gains. We expect regulatory changes in the 
calculation of ZZR by end-2018. This would reduce the ZZR costs significantly 
for the whole industry in coming years. We expect the ZZR cost, without taking 
into account the expected regulatory changes, to be about EUR300 million for 
Gothaer in 2018.

Gothaer's life insurance investments have a shorter duration than the group's 
life insurance liabilities. Fitch views this risk as negative for the ratings 
since it contributes to interest rate risk. GL has increased its asset duration 
in recent years to reduce this gap. Moreover, GL has shifted its new business 
product mix away from traditional life products with guaranteed interest rates 
to products that are less sensitive to interest rates, which we view as 
positive. Gothaer's duration gap is currently less than the German life market 
average and we expect it to remain so in 2018. 

In 2017, Gothaer generated gross written premiums (GWP) of EUR4.4 billion, 
unchanged from the previous year. GL saw a fall in new business premiums in 
recent years, which was stronger than the decrease in market new premiums. It 
was mainly driven by decreased single premiums. For 2018, we expect new business 
premiums to increase, and total premiums to reach EUR1.2 billion from EUR1.1 
billion in 2017.   

Gothaer is a well-diversified German mutual insurance group that writes all 
three main insurance businesses: life, health and property/casualty. It is one 
of the larger German mid-sized insurance groups with a strong and stable market 
position. Gothaer focuses on private customers and small-to-medium-sized 
enterprises. Products are distributed mainly via tied agents and independent 
financial advisors.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

An improvement in Gothaer's capitalisation, as indicated by the Prism FBM score 
increasing to ""Very Strong"" on a sustained basis, while maintaining a group 
return on equity above 7.5% (2017: 7.9%), could lead to an upgrade.

Key rating triggers for a downgrade include weakening capitalisation, as 
measured by a decline in the Fitch Prism Factor-Based Model score to the low end 
of the ""Strong"" category, and a net combined ratio of above 105%.

    * Support for junior coalition partner SPD halved
    * Results seen as vote against grand coalition

 (Releads with comment from Merkel)
    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
vowed on Monday to restore trust in her government after her
conservative allies suffered heavy losses in a regional
election, which their far-right foes hailed as ""an earthquake""
that would rock the ruling coalition.
    The Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of
Merkel's own Christian Democrats (CDU), slumped to its worst
result in almost 70 years in Sunday's election in Bavaria. The
chancellor's other coalition partner, the centre-left Social
Democrats (SPD), saw its support halved. [nL8N1WU02P]
    ""My lesson from this is that I, as chancellor, must make
sure that trust is won back. I will work on that with as much
vigour as I can,"" she said at an event of the BGA trade body.
    CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who is also interior minister in
Merkel's loveless coalition, had hoped his anti-immigration
rhetoric and criticism of Merkel's liberal asylum policies would
help his party fend off a threat from the far-right in Bavaria.
    His strategy backfired as the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria
for almost six decades, bled votes to the far-right Alternative
for Germany (AfD) party and the ecologist Greens in equal
measure. On Monday, he appeared to extend an olive branch. 
    ""We will do our bit to ensure that the coalition can
continue to do its work in a stable manner despite some of the
comments that were made yesterday,"" Seehofer told reporters.
    He was referring to angry CSU delegates who blamed their
party's dismal showing on Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome
some one million, mainly Muslim, asylum seekers, which has
fuelled the rise of the AfD.
    Merkel said the CSU had lost its absolute majority in the
Bavarian parliament even though the regional economy was doing
well.
    ""This shows that even a good economic situation and almost
full employment are not sufficient if trust is lacking,"" Merkel
said.
    The Bavarian economy grew by 2.8 percent last year,
outpacing the national rate of 2.2 percent. It also has the
lowest unemployment rate in Germany, 2.8 percent, compared with
just over 5 percent nationally.    
    The AfD gleefully seized on the election outcome as a sign
of a broader malaise for Merkel's coalition, which has been
shaken by disputes, including over immigration, since it took
power seven months ago.
    ""We are very pleased because the goal for the Bavaria state
election was to send an earthquake towards Berlin,"" Martin
Sichert, AfD leader in Bavaria, told a news conference. ""This
earthquake happened .... We are now excited to see what the
consequences will be here in Berlin.""
    The CSU also lost support to the Free Voters, a protest
party of mainly conservative independents.
    In Bavaria, the CSU will now try to form a coalition either
with the Free Voters - its preferred option - or with the Greens
who are ideologically distant.
    
    ""PAINFUL""
    The ruling coalition was borne of necessity rather than
choice after an inconclusive general election in September 2017.
    The Bavarian election was also a wake-up call for the SPD,
which saw its support halve to just under 10 percent, prompting
a discussion over the sustainability of its alliance at national
level with Merkel's conservative bloc.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
 join the government after vowing before the 2017 election to
sit in opposition if they lost to the conservatives. They are
now demanding consequences.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles blamed her party's losses in
Bavaria on infighting at national level between the CDU and CSU.
    ""It is obvious that the whole style of our cooperation must
change,"" she told reporters. ""We urgently need to work on the
style and communication and also on substantive progress."" 
    Polls suggest the ruling parties will again be punished in
two weeks' time in an election in the western state of Hesse,
where they are expected to lose voters to the AfD and the
Greens.
    The state is ruled by Merkel's CDU in a coalition with the
Greens and a slump in support for the conservatives there would
almost certainly further weaken the chancellor's authority.
    Merkel, who has been in power since 2005 and is Europe's
most powerful leader, then faces further potential pitfalls in
the form of a CDU conclave and the party's annual congress in
early December.
    The 64-year-old Merkel has won support from key
conservatives in her bid  for re-election as CDU chairwoman at
the congress. But this could change if the CDU loses Hesse to an
SPD-Greens coalition.
    ""If the CDU loses the government in Hesse, this will
probably start a discussion within the CDU about Merkel's
position,"" wrote mass-selling newspaper Bild.

    PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca <AZN.L> has suspended
investments in Britain due to the lack of clarity over the
country's departure from the European Union, the pharmaceutical
firm's non-executive chairman Leif Johansson told France's Le
Monde newspaper.
    British Prime Minister Theresa May was facing growing
pressure on Monday to rethink her plan for leaving the EU after
Brexit talks reached a stand-off at the weekend over
arrangements for the UK border with Ireland. [nL8N1WV31L]
    ""If a transition deal does not make clear what will happen
in the future, we will maintain our decision not to invest,"" Le
Monde quoted Johansson as saying in an interview.
    ""A Brexit agreement will need to ensure that Britain does
not become an isolated island in the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean,"" he added. 
    AstraZeneca has already spent 40 million pounds ($53
million) stockpiling medicines in Britain and continental Europe
to prevent supply disruptions if the two sides fail to reach a
withdrawal agreement. 
    Some pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca have
warned of medicine shortages in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit.
    More than 2,600 drugs have some part of their manufacturing
carried out in Britain. Britain exports some 45 million medical
packs to EU countries each month, industry figures show, while
37 million flow to Britain from the EU.
    France's largest drugmaker Sanofi <SASY.PA> said in August 
it would increase medicine stockpiles in Britain, echoing moves
made by GlaxoSmithKline <GSK.L>, Roche <ROG.S> and Novartis
<NOVN.S>.
    ""In business, uncertainty often forces you to make
decisions. But what is frustrating is to have to do so when the
existing system works very well,"" Johansson said. ""This is
costing us money and brings us no benefit.""

    PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A French government reshuffle,
expected since the resignation of the interior minister two
weeks ago, was postponed on Monday, an aide close to President
Emmanuel Macron said.
    The decision was due to deadly floods in the south of
France, which both Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe
were monitoring, the official said. [nL8N1WV1I6]
    The official could not say if the reshuffle, which Macron
hopes will allow him to draw a line under a difficult few
months, with three ministers having left the government since
the end of August, would take place before the weekly cabinet
meeting on Wednesday. 
    The new cabinet line-up, which had been expected shortly
after Gerard Collomb resigned as interior minister on Oct. 2,
has been portrayed as imminent for at least a week. 
    Opposition politicians say the delay shows that Macron's
political party, Republique En Marche, which was created barely
two years ago to prepare his bid for the presidency, is
struggling to attract candidates to join the government.
    After a positive first few months in office, Macron, 40, has
seen his popularity wane. Most opinion polls now put his
approval rating at barely 30 percent, less than half the level
shortly after he took office. 
    Opponents have been emboldened.
    ""Postponed again! It's not a government #reshuffle anymore,
it's a collapse: that of the President's authority,"" hard-left
leader Jean-Luc Melenchon tweeted.
    Macron and his government say he and Philippe are simply
taking the time needed to put together the right team.
    ""In any organisation ... you need to take the time to know
people, make sure you have the same mindset, check everything,""
Macron told France 24 and RFI television on Friday. 
    ""I'm doing things calmly,"" he said, adding that the
government was carrying on normally with its work.
    Philippe has taken on the interior portfolio on an interim
basis.

be offered to individual investors in Slovenia and 90 percent to
institutional investors.

October 26, they added. 
    The London branch of Deutsche Bank AG <DBN.UL> and J.P.

    ""NLB has showcased a strong track record of performance in
the past years and it is expected it will continue to

    While actual shares will be listed in Ljubljana, the London
listing will consist of global depository receipts (GDR)

    According to local media, including daily newspaper Finance

will be determined on Nov. 8 or 9, with the government looking
to raise about 1.5 billion euros ($1.74 billion) from the sale.

    AMSTERDAM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Dutch financial markets
regulator, already scrambling to process a flurry of relocation
requests from UK-based companies, will need about 10 percent
more staff to cope with the extra work caused by Brexit, sources
close to the matter told Reuters. 
    Amsterdam is competing with European Union cities including
Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin to attract business from London,
with all chalking up recent major relocation wins ahead of
Britain's departure from the EU in March.
    More than 20 trading firms have applied for licences to
relocate operations to Amsterdam. [nL5N1VZ2OA]
    The Dutch have also started hiring about 950 customs
officers, mostly at Rotterdam Port, Europe's largest, to prepare
for the extra bureaucracy required for British goods to enter
the EU if the two sides do not reach a withdrawal agreement. 
    The financial markets regulator, known by its Dutch acronym
AFM, is having trouble filling jobs as it pulls resources from
across the organisation to a dedicated Brexit team, the sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    The AFM, with an annual budget of nearly 100 million euros
($116 million) and 650 staff, on Monday declined to comment on
the details, but a spokesman said that if Brexit went ahead, the
regulator would need increased funding.
    The organisation will seek millions of euros to bolster its
budget during upcoming meetings with the finance ministry, one
of the sources said.
    ""It is unclear exactly what will happen and which trading
platforms will come to Amsterdam, but it has the potential to
have a huge impact on the European trading market,"" said
another. ""In any Brexit scenario, there will need to be a lot
more resources.""
    London has long dominated securities trading in the EU and
Britain’s counterpart to the AFM, the Financial Conduct
Authority, has 3,400 staff to ensure orderly markets.
    The first source said the AFM would need roughly 10 percent
more staff, or at least 60 full-time workers, to handle the
increased workload.
    Among major players in the process of setting up Dutch
operations are Chicago’s Cboe Global Markets <CBOE.O>,  the
London Stock Exchange Group <LSE.L>, Japan’s Norinchukin Bank
[NORB.UL] and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T>, as well
as U.S. firms Marketaxess <MKTX.O>, Jane Street and Tradeweb.
    The Netherlands, with strong UK trading ties, is more
economically exposed to Brexit than most EU countries. Gross
domestic product could be hurt by as much as 4 percentage points
by 2030 in the worst scenario, according to Rabobank forecasts.
    Brexit is set to force the EU to rethink its core securities
trading rules, known as MiFID II, which were introduced in
January, creating further demands on the bloc’s regulators. The
EU’s European Securities and Markets Authority, which oversees
securities markets in conjunction with national watchdogs like
the AFM, has repeatedly said it also needs more resources.

    By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May urged
the European Union on Monday not to allow a stand-off with the
European Union over the so-called Irish backstop to derail the
Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was achievable.
    In a statement to parliament before she heads to Brussels
for a crucial summit on Wednesday, May was upbeat about the
chances of a deal with the EU, but repeated that she would not
agree to anything that could split Britain.
    However, less than six months before Britain leaves the
bloc, May is under mounting pressure to change her strategy
after talks with the EU were paused at the weekend when the two
sides failed to agree on how to deal with the UK's only land
border with the EU.
    The problem of how to prevent the return of a hard border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member
Ireland has become the biggest hurdle to a deal on Brexit,
Britain's biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years, and
has increased the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal.
    ""It is frustrating that almost all the remaining points of
disagreement are focused on how we manage a scenario which both
sides hope should never come to pass and which, if it does,
would only be temporary,"" May said.
    
    ""OUTCOME THAT NO-ONE WANTS""
    ""We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a
good deal and leave us with a 'no-deal' outcome that no-one
wants,"" she told a rowdy session of parliament. 
    May tried to lead lawmakers, many of whom have criticised
not only her Brexit plans but also her negotiating strategy,
through the difficulties of what happened in Brussels after her
Brexit minister raced there for talks on Sunday.
    She said the EU had stuck to its proposal of keeping
Northern Ireland in the EU customs union if a UK-wide plan is
not ready to be put in place after a transitional arrangement
runs out at the end of 2020.
    But for May, who has said repeatedly that she will not
countenance the breakup of the United Kingdom, any suggestion
that Northern Ireland could be treated differently to the rest
of Britain was unacceptable.
    ""As I have said many times, I could never accept that, no
matter how unlikely such a scenario may be,"" she said.
    ""So it must be the case, first, that the backstop should not
need to come into force.""
    But May still faces a struggle to ease the concerns of not
only the EU, but of her Conservative Party and her partners in
parliament, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    
    TAKING LONGER
    Eurosceptics in her party fear that a backstop could keep
Britain indefinitely in the bloc's customs union, while the DUP
says it can never accept anything that splits Northern Ireland
from the rest of Britain, even going so far as to say it would
withdraw the support in parliament upon which May relies.
    There has been little success so far in narrowing that gap,
and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said any deal would now
""take a bit more time than many people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said she had been ""very
hopeful"" that a deal on Britain's exit could be achieved but ""at
the moment it actually looks a bit more difficult"". [nS8N1WO01N]
    A spokesman for May held out hope, saying there were ""a
number of means of achieving what we want to achieve"" on the
backstop. He declined to give details and repeated Britain's
view that any such arrangement would be
time-limited.[nS8N1U8006]
    ""I need to be able to look the British people in the eye and
say this backstop is a temporary solution,"" May told parliament.
    ""This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail. And it is
the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but
critical issues that are still to be agreed.""

 (Adds Opel statement)
    FRANKFURT, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Germany's Transport Ministry
said on Monday it would order roughly 100,000 Opel vehicles to
be recalled as part of an emissions probe, after prosecutors
searched the carmaker's offices earlier in the day.
    German motor vehicle authority KBA found four software
programmes capable of altering vehicle emissions in 2015, and
ordered Opel to implement a software update in cars to remove
them, Germany's Transport Ministry said in a statement.
    ""After a fifth software device was discovered in early 2018,
which KBA found to be illegal, there is currently an official
hearing going on with the goal of imposing a mandatory recall
for the models Cascada, Insignia and Zafira,"" the ministry said
in a statement.
    The transport ministry said Opel had dragged its feet on the
hearing. The KBA had told Frankfurt prosecutors about the
software device in April, it said.
    ""The official recall of the affected roughly 100,000
vehicles will take place shortly,"" it added.
    Opel said in a statement it rejected any accusation of using
illegal defeat devices that can manipulate exhaust emission
tests, also denying it was procrastinating.
    ""Should (a mandatory recall) be ordered, Opel will challenge
it legally,"" said the carmaker .
    German prosecutors searched offices at Opel's sites in
Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern earlier on Monday. 
    The Frankfurt prosecutor's office said it was probing 95,000
vehicles equipped with Euro 6d engines.
    PSA Group, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, declined
to comment. 
    The Opel Insignia, Zafira and Cascada were developed when
Opel and its sister brand Vauxhall were still owned by General
Motors <GM.N>. General Motors sold Opel to PSA Group in 2017.
    Opel admitted in 2016 that its Zafira model contained engine
software which switched off exhaust emissions treatment systems
under certain circumstances. Opel insisted at the time that it
was making use of a legal loophole.

 (Adds Tusk)
    By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May urged
the EU on Monday not to allow a stand-off over a 'backstop' for
Ireland to derail Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was
still achievable as a top EU official said chances of a no-deal
divorce had increased.
    Addressing a rowdy session of parliament before she headed
to Brussels for a summit on Wednesday, May remained upbeat but
repeated she would not agree to anything that could split the
United Kingdom.
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the bloc,
talks stalled at the weekend over how to ensure there is no
return of a hard border between the British province of Northern
Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
    The stalemate has increased the possibility of Britain
leaving the bloc without an agreement, a ""no deal"" Brexit that
could potentially disrupt trade, delay movement of goods, and
starve the world's fifth largest economy of investment.
    European Council President Donald Tusk said that scenario
was ""more likely than ever before"" and one that the EU should be
ready for, though all parties must do their best to reach a
deal.
    He said he had invited May to address her 27 EU peers on
Brexit on Wednesday evening.
    May said it was frustrating that ""almost all the remaining
points of disagreement are focused on how we manage a scenario
which both sides hope should never come to pass and which, if it
does, would only be temporary.
    ""We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a
good deal and leave us with a 'no-deal' outcome that no-one
wants,"" she told parliament. 
    Underlining the economic importance of Brexit, the head of
British-headquartered pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca <AZN.L>
said it would keep its freeze on manufacturing investments in
the country unless a deal provides clarity about future ties.
[nL8N1WV4R5]
        
    DIVISIONS ON SHOW
    The 2016 referendum on membership of the EU deeply divided
Britain, and those rifts were on show in parliament, where May
received more demands for reassurance than words of support from
lawmakers, even those in her own Conservative Party.
    May tried to explain the obstacles, which she described as
largely technical, that had scuppered any hope of agreement in
the talks in Brussels on Sunday.
    She said the EU had stuck to a proposal of keeping Northern
Ireland in its customs union if a UK-wide plan was not ready to
be put in place when a transitional arrangement runs out at the
end of 2020.
    May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop
must be temporary, ending at the latest in December 2021, but
the EU has refused to set an end date.
    May described that as asking for ""a backstop to a backstop""
and said again Northern Ireland could not be treated differently
from the rest of Britain.
    ""As I have said many times, I could never accept that, no
matter how unlikely such a scenario may be,"" she said.
    But May still faces a struggle to ease the concerns of not
only the EU, but of her Conservative Party and her partners in
parliament, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
    The DUP's Nigel Dodds pressed May for new reassurance that
she will stand by her words about Britain leaving as one
country, rolling his eyes when she answered by repeating
familiar phrases.
    May also needs to try to keep eurosceptics in her party on
board. Her former foreign minister turned loudest critic, Boris
Johnson, pressed her to put a firm time limit on any backstop.
    EU leaders expressed disappointment that the backstop row
had sunk the possibility of a deal at the weekend, with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel saying ""at the moment it actually looks
a bit more difficult"". [nS8N1WO01N]
    Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said any deal would now
""take a bit more time than many people had hoped"". [nL8N1WV201]
    But a spokesman for May expressed hope, saying there were ""a
number of means of achieving what we want to achieve"" on the
backstop, but declined to give details. [nS8N1U8006]
    And, in a change of tone, Arlene Foster, the leader of the
DUP, told reporters she also hoped for a ""sensible"" Brexit.
    Nigel Farage, who as head of the United Kingdom Independence
Party (UKIP) was a leading 'leave' campaigner for the 2016
referendum on EU membership, said he believed negotiations had
""hit a wall"".

 ECB refinancing rate poll data

    By Mumal Rathore
    BENGALURU, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
end its bond-buying programme in less than three months, with a
low likelihood of an extension despite a cocktail of political
and trade concerns, economists unanimously said in a Reuters
poll.
    Having bought more than 2.6 trillion euros worth of mostly
government bonds since March 2015, the ECB has been slowly
trimming back its purchases, hoping it has already done enough
to bolster growth and inflation.
    The gradual reduction in the amount of monthly stimulus has
persisted even with plenty of evidence that euro zone growth
momentum peaked a long while back, and with additional economic
and political risks mounting.
    Still, all 70 economists who answered an additional question
in the latest poll, taken before the Italian cabinet was due to
meet on Monday to discuss its 2019 budget, said chances that the
central bank would extend its bond buying programme were low.
    Italy's cabinet was expected to approve on Tuesday the
budget, which envisages a jump in the deficit that has upset
financial markets. [nL8N1WV1L6]
    The latest Reuters poll of more than 80 economists taken on
Oct 9-15 also found that euro zone inflation would languish
below the central bank's target until at least 2021. 
    ""The essence of the ECB's strategy is a gradual end of the
net asset purchases of QE by the end of the year and possibly a
first rate hike in September or October next year,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, chief economist at ING.
    ""However, it is currently far too early to answer these
questions. Why should the ECB unnecessarily commit itself? As
illustrated by the current market turmoil, and doubts about the
strength of the global economy, too much can happen between now
and the end of summer 2019.""
    Minutes from the central bank's September meeting released
on Thursday showed ECB policymakers remained optimistic.
[nL8N1WR3P0]
    With euro zone inflation forecast to average just 1.7
percent this year, next and in 2020, below the ECB's 2 percent
target ceiling, the central bank was still expected to raise
interest rates in the second half of next year.
    The deposit rate will rise 15 basis points to -0.25 percent
in the third quarter and the refinancing rate to 10 basis points
from the current zero percent in the final quarter of 2019,
according to the latest poll.
    ""The ECB is next due to provide further details on its
reinvestment process and perhaps update its forward guidance and
we expect it to sound dovish, but stay short of indicating that
it will actively try to lengthen the duration of its purchases
during the reinvestment phase,"" noted Ebrahim Rahbari, director
of the global economics team at Citi in New York.
    ""And despite a few recent hawkish noises, it remains very
unlikely that the ECB would consider a rate hike before
September 2019.""
    In the meantime, private business surveys suggest the
escalating trade war is already hurting factories across the
euro zone, with the September reading showing overall business
activity slowing to a four-month low. [EUR/PMIS]
    The euro zone economy is expected to grow at a steady 0.4
percent rate every quarter through to the end of next year.
    Growth will average 2.0 percent this year, slightly lower
than the 2.1 percent predicted last month, the consensus showed.
    That was in line with the International Monetary Fund's
growth projections, which downgraded its view from July on a
weaker performance by major euro zone countries. [nL2N1WP03N]
    Euro zone economic growth is seen at 1.8 percent next year
and at 1.6 percent in 2020, both unchanged from the previous
poll.
    When asked about the likelihood of a euro zone recession in
the next year, the median of 43 economists was 15 percent. For
the next two years, the figure was 25 percent, unchanged from
August's poll.
    Findings in the latest Reuters polls were not very different
for top economies in the region. Economists cut their growth
outlook for Germany, France and Italy from a July poll.

    HEADLINES ROUNDUP: EARNINGS START TO FLOW IN (0559 GMT)
    It looks there is no big corporate news that could shake markets this morning, although the
European earnings season is starting to see the first releases with results coming in from
TomTom <TOM2.AS> and Talanx <TLXGn.DE>. 
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report this week. Overall, third quarter
earnings are expected to have risen 14 percent on revenues up 7.4 percent, according to
Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
    Telecoms could also continue to draw attention after Deutsche Telekom said it was confident
it will secure EU antitrust approval to buy Tele2's Dutch business.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO STABILISE ABOVE 22-MONTH LOWS (0512 GMT)
    European shares are expected to rise slightly at the open today, further stabilising
following a turbulent week that pushed them to 22-month lows, as investors reacted to a steep
rise in U.S. Treasury yields and fresh political worries. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 1 point higher at 7,031, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 30 points higher at 11,644 and Paris' CAC to open 8 points higher at 5,103.
    In Asia, stocks rose modestly, gaining a firmer footing after a week of heavy losses,
although increasing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the West fanned geopolitical concerns and
capped gains. [nL3N1WW1Q8]

    ON OUR RADAR: UPDATES FROM BAT, MEGGITT, TOMTOM (0651 GMT)
    European shares are set to stabilise above 22-month lows hit in the previous session as the
focus turns from the upset caused by a steep surge in U.S. yields to the start of the reporting
season which is expected to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter.
    Futures on main euro zone benchmarks were trading up 0.1 percent, while FTSE futures were
lagging a tad behind amid uncertainty surrounding Brexit talks.
    In earning updates, British American Tobacco <BATS.L> cut its full-year revenue target for
next-generation products, citing a flat market in Japan and a product recall in the United
States. On a more positive note, engineer Meggitt raised its estimate for 2018 organic revenue
growth thanks to higher demand for its wheels, brakes, fuel tanks and other aeroplane parts,
while TomTom posted a stronger-than-expected rise in third-quarter core earnings.
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report this week. Overall, third quarter
earnings for the index are expected to have risen 14 percent on revenues up 7.4 percent,
according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data, while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That
compares to the 21.6 percent growth seen for US companies.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 16: Dutch competition authority, ACM, on 28 
September 2018  announced the conclusions of its study into market power among 
the country's leading fixed-line telecoms networks, Royal KPN (KPN, 
'BBB'/Stable) and VodafoneZiggo (VZ, B+/Stable). Its findings included the 
determination that together the operators have significant market power and that 
consequently VZ will be required to provide regulated wholesale fixed access to 
its network. (KPN is already required to do this). 

In Fitch's view the determination has implications for the Dutch broadband and 
convergent markets, while also raising questions for other European markets: 
most notably whether the ACM's decision might be copied by other market 
regulators.  At this stage Fitch views that the Dutch decision (along with 
regulated access in Belgium) does not necessarily establish a market trend given 
very high cable network coverage and the similar retail broadband shares enjoyed 
by the incumbent and cable operator.  

VZ's cable network covers 95% of Dutch households while KPN and VZ each have a 
retail broadband share of the order of 40%-45%. In our view these are important 
factors in the ACM's conclusion that together they have the ability to influence 
pricing on the market and potentially limit market competition. In no other 
large European cable market do we find such scale and equilibrium among the 
market's infrastructure providers. 

In terms of leading economies, Germany is perhaps the country attention could 
focus on next given the proposed acquisition of Unitymedia, B+/RWP) by Vodafone 
(BBB+/Positive). This would effectively consolidate the country's cable networks 
under single ownership - we estimate covering around 64% of Germany's households 
with a combined retail broadband share of around 30%. This compares with the 
incumbent's ubiquitous network and 40% market share. 

The acquisition has yet to gain European Commission approval . Cable open access 
could be a remedy considered for the deal to progress. Yet in Fitch's view 
imbalances in both network coverage and retail market share with Deutsche 
Telekom (BBB+/Stable), do not make this outcome obvious. However, German 
competition authorities have been resistant to cable consolidation in the past. 
Fitch argues the less advanced state of Germany's cable network with 100% of the 
network yet to be upgraded to DOCSIS 3.0 and the Level3/Level 4 market structure 
that still exists, could dilute the argument for regulatory access to the cable 
network. Fitch also believes regulators need to find a balance between 
encouraging incumbent owners to invest in fibre and the imposition of wider 
wholesale network regulation, something which could have the unintended 
consequence of reducing investment returns on the incumbent's fibre rollout.

In the UK Virgin Media plc's (VMED BB-/Stable) cable network passes around 50% 
of UK households; the company's plans to build out a further 4 million homes 
would take this number to around 64%. The cable operator's broadband market 
share stands at around 21% versus BT, the incumbent's retail share of around 
30%. With these businesses combined therefore commanding just over 50% of the 
market and cable's less advanced coverage position we again feel that the 
evidence is not compelling for regulated access to the cable network. UK 
regulator, Ofcom, has in the past emphasised the benefits to the digital economy 
of VMED's network expansion, something that Fitch considers may also be 
supportive of a less rigorous approach to potential cable regulation. 

Other markets we have considered include France and Poland, neither of which do 
we feel is under significant threat of regulation - mainly on the basis of 
network coverage. The EU's digital scoreboard confirms France's cable household 
coverage of around 28%, and Poland's of  44%, (both at end-1H17).  In both 
markets the incumbent has a commanding lead in terms of broadband market share, 
while an underdeveloped or fragmented cable infrastructure would also in our 
view act as a mitigating factor to regulated cable access. 

Netherlands Impacts

It is too early to assess clearly the impact of ACM's determination either on VZ 
or KPN. Dutch fixed-line revenues have fallen at a CAGR of 3.3% over the past 
three years, led by a wholesale market that has fallen at a CAGR of nearly 9%. 
Falling at this pace, wholesale revenues account for 9% of total fixed market 
revenues (2017). KPN's wholesale revenues (fixed and mobile) accounted for 11% 
of 2017 domestic revenues; their 7.6% decline the largest contributor to a 2.5% 
overall decrease for its Dutch business. In our view the entry of an alternative 
provider of regulated wholesale access arguably with better ultra high-speed 
broadband coverage in the shape of VZ will add pressure to what we had viewed as 
a stabilising situation for the incumbent's revenues.  

The wider question is whether the expansion of wholesale access to include cable 
will promote stronger retail competition and drive revenue erosion at KPN and 
VZ. The ACM's determination gives VZ three months to come up with a wholesale 
reference offer. In Fitch's view a successful retail communications offer in a 
market like the Netherlands depends on a number of things - including convergent 
capabilities, strong service quality and retail distribution, a compelling or 
segmented content offer and access to increasingly high bandwidth. The ACM's 
decision promoting access to a wider array of infrastructure addresses one of 
these factors - the last. Under existing regulation Tele2 and T-Mobile together 
accounted for 7% of the country's broadband connections (at end-3Q17), a share 
that has at best been stagnating and in our view underpins the regulator's 
decision to regulate cable. The ACM's ruling is likely to introduce pricing 
tension for these and other service providers using wholesale access, as well as 
place pressure on pricing on the retail market. 

The pricing structure of cable access agreed with the regulator will be 
important; in Belgium it took a number of years before wholesale pricing on 
cable was sufficiently attractive to drive market share and volume onto 
alternative retail service providers (SPs). In the Netherlands VZ has been given 
three months to come up with a reference offer. If for instance a first step 
sees wholesale pricing which is similar to that offered to SPs over the 
incumbent network, impacts on the retail market may not be that material. If 
this were the case we would expect the regulator to take further action over 
time. 

Both KPN and VZ have ratings headroom at present. The effect of the ACM 
announcement is likely to continue to put pressure on KPN's wholesale segment 
revenues, potentially introducing renewed pressure on VZ's cable business over 
the medium term. Service providers switching wholesale access provider could be 
fairly immediate. The impact on the retail market is likely to take longer to 
materialise.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
dropped across the board on Tuesday, narrowing the spread over
German peers, after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
defended the country's deficit hiking budget, boosting hopes he
would stay on in government. 
    While Italy's expansionary budget, officially signed off on
Monday, likely sets up a showdown with Brussels, a lot of those
concerns were already priced in, so investors on Tuesday focused
on Tria's comments instead. 
    He said he was confident he could explain to the Commission
that Italy needed to raise spending to offset a slowing economy,
and described the 2.4 percent deficit target as ""normal"".
[nL8N1WV1L6]
    The economy minister is seen by investors as a key
moderating influence in government, particularly on the two
deputy prime ministers and main anti-establishment figures
Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio. 
    ""The most important reason (for the drop in yields) is that
Tria is continuing to stick to the government and defending the
budget, this is taken positively by the market,"" said DZ Bank
strategist Christian Lenk.     
    ""We have already priced in a lot of negative news on Italy,
so maybe for some investors it's starting to look interesting
again."" 
    Italian bond yields were down between five and 14 basis
points in early trade, with two-year yields 14 bps lower to a
one-week low of 1.60 percent and 10-year yields down eight bps
at 3.48 percent. <IT2YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR> 
    The closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread
tightened 11 basis points to 297 bps, moving further away from a
five-year peak of around 315 bps hit last week.  <IT10YT=RR>
<DE10YT=RR>
    Some large bond fund managers have said recently that the
higher Italian yields are proving attractive. 
    JPMorgan Asset Management's Nick Gartside was last week
reported as saying some of the funds within the group are
increasing exposure to Italian bonds. [nL8N1WR0V0]
    Other analysts attributed the drop in Italian yields to a
general improvement in risk sentiment, with world markets
calming a touch after the wild swings of last week. 
    Indeed, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields were also
lower on the day, albeit by only a basis point each. <ES10YT=RR>
<PT10YT=RR>     
    High-grade euro zone government bond yields were unchanged
on Tuesday, having dropped sharply over the past week on a bid
for safe assets. 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, was steady at 0.50 percent, hovering above two-week
lows of 0.478 percent hit on Monday. <DE10YT=RR> 
    This could drop lower after the ZEW research institute
releases its latest survey on German investor morale at 0900 GMT
if analysts are accurate in their expectation that the indicator
will edge down slightly.

whose government has been shaken by a spate of resignations and
whose popularity has fallen in the polls, reshuffled his cabinet
on Tuesday, moving a close ally into the Interior Ministry. 
    Most of the other moves were in less high-profile positions,
including a new agriculture minister and culture minister.
    Below our profiles of some of the major ministerial posts
after the reshuffle:
    
    PRIME MINISTER EDOUARD PHILIPPE, 47
    Philippe retains his job as prime minister. The former
conservative mayor of Le Havre was little known on the national
political scene until Macron plucked him from obscurity to lead
his government last year.
    His political experience has helped him in past weeks guide
Macron through a turbulent period that analysts say have exposed
the president's political rawness.
    Although a little more popular than Macron, the boxing fan's
 approval ratings in opinion polls have also fallen sharply in
past months. He served as head of public affairs for state
nuclear giant Areva between 2007 and 2010.
    
    CHRISTOPHE CASTANER, 52, MOVES TO INTERIOR MINISTRY
    The Provence-born former Socialist was one of Macron's
earliest backers, winning a place in the president's inner
circle during the campaign.
    After a few months as the government's spokesman, Castaner
was named as leader of Macron's fledgling Republique En Marche
party. He has spearheaded Macron's efforts to forge alliances
with like-minded parties across Europe ahead of European
Parliament elections next year.
    Castaner moves to the Interior Ministry, taking over from
Gerard Collomb, whose resignation earlier this month gave rise
to the reshuffle. The post is a sensitive one; in moving
Castaner into it, Macron rewards a close ally while keeping
someone he trusts in a critical, senior portfolio.
       
    JEAN-YVES LE DRIAN, 71, REMAINS AS FOREIGN MINISTER 
    One of the few career politicians in Macron's government, Le
Drian acquired a reputation as a safe pair of hands under the
previous Socialist administration, during which he served as
defense minister.
    A driving force behind France's counter-terrorism operations
in West Africa and the Middle East, he was also credited with
leading a resurgence in French weapons' exports, including the
first exports of the Rafale fighter jet.
    As foreign minister, he has kept a distinctly low profile,
refraining from the rhetoric often associated with French
diplomacy. The former university history teacher has spent over
35 years in politics and was president of the Brittany region.
    
    BRUNO LE MAIRE, 49, REMAINS AS FINANCE MINISTER
    Bruno Le Maire is a German-speaking centre-right politician
whose expertise on Europe and staunch defence of the
Franco-German relationship made him Macron's main negotiator
with the German government over his ambitious euro zone reform
plans.
    A reform-minded conservative, Le Maire has steered Macron's
drive to lighten the government touch on the economy and cut
red-tape, and is overseeing a push to privatise airports and
other state-controlled companies.
    A diplomat early in his career, Le Maire served as minister
under former president Nicolas Sarkozy and ran in The
Republicans party primary in the 2017 presidential race, but
scored poorly. He broke ranks with the conservatives after
publicly backing Macron the night he was elected president.
    He has written several novels, including one describing a
steamy scene between a minister and his wife in Venice.
    
    GERALD DARMANIN, 36, REMAINS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS MINISTER
    One of the youngest members in Macron's government at 36,
the conservative and former Sarkozy ally has become a rising
star in the cabinet. 
    His acute political sense, working-class background - he is
the son of a cleaning lady of Algerian descent - and reputation
as a plain speaker have made him popular with the public at a
time Macron faces accusations of being aloof and out of touch.
    As budget minister, he is in charge of overseeing Macron's
pledge to cut public spending and can claim credit for bringing
the budget deficit below the EU-mandated limit of 3 percent of
GDP last year, the first time in a decade for France.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES BUILD ON RECOVERY (0751 GMT)
    In early deals, European shares are climbing 0.4 percent with defensive sectors utilities,
telecoms and real estate, as well as autos, leading the way. 
    Merlin meanwhile is down 7.7 percent, set for its worst day in a year after warning about 
rising costs from labour and regulation. [nL8N1WW13N]
    British American Tobacco shares are down just 1.2 percent but the heavyweight is weighing on
the FTSE, after it cut its forecast for revenues from non-cigarette products.
    Broker notes are also moving some stocks.
    Kion shares are up 10.2 percent, top of the STOXX after UBS upgraded it to ""buy"", saying a
recent pullback has taken the shares down too far. ""While we were previously concerned that the
market could overrate the structural growth in warehouse automation and underrate the cyclical
challenges in trucks, we think it is now likely the opposite on both counts,"" they write. 
    Ocado is also up 4.5 percent with traders citing a double upgrade to ""buy"" from BAML.
    Italy's FTSE MIB is up 1.4 percent, outperforming the rest as Italian bond yields fall on
encouraging comments from Tria.

    ON OUR RADAR: UPDATES FROM BAT, MEGGITT, TOMTOM (0651 GMT)
    European shares are set to stabilise above 22-month lows hit in the previous session as the
focus turns from the upset caused by a steep surge in U.S. yields to the start of the reporting
season which is expected to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter.
    Futures on main euro zone benchmarks were trading up 0.1 percent, while FTSE futures were
lagging a tad behind amid uncertainty surrounding Brexit talks.
    In earning updates, British American Tobacco <BATS.L> cut its full-year revenue target for
next-generation products, citing a flat market in Japan and a product recall in the United
States. On a more positive note, engineer Meggitt raised its estimate for 2018 organic revenue
growth thanks to higher demand for its wheels, brakes, fuel tanks and other aeroplane parts,
while TomTom posted a stronger-than-expected rise in third-quarter core earnings.
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report this week. Overall, third quarter
earnings for the index are expected to have risen 14 percent on revenues up 7.4 percent,
according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data, while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That
compares to the 21.6 percent growth seen for US companies.

    HEADLINES ROUNDUP: EARNINGS START TO FLOW IN (0559 GMT)
    It looks there is no big corporate news that could shake markets this morning, although the
European earnings season is starting to see the first releases with results coming in from
TomTom <TOM2.AS> and Talanx <TLXGn.DE>. 
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report this week. Overall, third quarter
earnings are expected to have risen 14 percent on revenues up 7.4 percent, according to
Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
    Telecoms could also continue to draw attention after Deutsche Telekom said it was confident
it will secure EU antitrust approval to buy Tele2's Dutch business.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO STABILISE ABOVE 22-MONTH LOWS (0512 GMT)
    European shares are expected to rise slightly at the open today, further stabilising
following a turbulent week that pushed them to 22-month lows, as investors reacted to a steep
rise in U.S. Treasury yields and fresh political worries. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 1 point higher at 7,031, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 30 points higher at 11,644 and Paris' CAC to open 8 points higher at 5,103.
    In Asia, stocks rose modestly, gaining a firmer footing after a week of heavy losses,
although increasing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the West fanned geopolitical concerns and
capped gains. [nL3N1WW1Q8]

    PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
reshuffled his government on Tuesday, naming loyalist and head
of his ruling party Christophe Castaner to the post of interior
minister.
    The reshuffle is an attempt to steady his administration
after a series of resignations and revive a reform drive that
has shown signs of flagging.
    In moving Castaner to the Interior Ministry, Macron has both
rewarded a close ally with a senior post, while keeping someone
he trusts in a critical portfolio. 
    It was the resignation earlier this month of interior
minister Gerard Collomb, an early backer of Macron, that
prompted the reshuffle.
    France's leader had been expected to announce the revamp
last week, but said he wanted to take more time to ensure the
right decisions were made. Opponents said that raised questions 
about the depth of experience in his party.
    An official in Macron's office described the new cabinet as
""dynamic"".
    ""We have both incoming names with a reputation in their
areas of expertise, which will strengthen the government's
efficiency, and others who have a broader profile,"" the official
said.  
    Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has spearheaded
Macron's euro zone reform push, and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves
Le Drian retained their posts.
    Most of the new appointments were in relatively less
high-profile positions, including a new agriculture minister,
culture minister and minister for overseas territories.

    By Danilo Masoni
    MILAN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday
helped by stronger defensive stocks as the focus turned to the
start of the reporting season which is expected to deliver
double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> index was up 0.4 percent
by 0834 GMT, after hitting a 22-month low in the previous
session on the back of risings U.S. Treasury yields and a mix of
geopolitical tensions. 
    Despite the bounce some caution remained after a turbulent
start of October that saw the STOXX 600 post on Friday its
biggest weekly loss since February. The index remains down 7.4
percent so far this year. 
    ""Investors are... struggling with the ongoing U.S.-China
trade war, Brexit talks, Italy's budget clash with Brussels, EM
slow down, and the most recent geopolitical tensions between
Saudi Arabia and the U.S.,"" said FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed. 
  
    Defensive and cheaply valued stocks such as utilities
<.SX6P> and telecoms <.SXKP> led sectoral gainers with Italian
utility Enel <ENEI.MI> up 3.4 percent and Germany's Deutsche
Telekom <DTEGn.DE> up 0.7 percent, while autos also rose
strongly despite emission woes hitting Volvo shares. 
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report
results this week with the earnings season passing its mid-point
during the first week of November.
    Overall, third-quarter earnings for the index are expected
to have risen 14 percent, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data,
while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That compares
to the 21.6 percent growth seen for U.S. companies.
    Meggitt <MGGT.L> was among the biggest gainers in Europe, up
5.6 percent after the engineering firm upgraded its 2018 organic
revenue growth guidance, boosted by higher demand for its
wheels, brakes, fuel tanks and other aeroplane parts.
[nL8N1WW12Z]
    Shares in other aero-defence stocks were also gaining:
Airbus <AIR.PA>, Safran <SAF.PA> and BAE Systems <BAES.L> all
rose between 1 and 2 percent.
    Bellway <BWY.L> also rose after the British housing
developer launched a cost savings program and reported a more
than 14 percent rise in full-year pre-tax profit. [nL3N1WW2J5]
    Other updates on Tuesday, however, disappointed investors.
    BAT <BATS.L> fell 1.3 percent after the world's
second-biggest tobacco company cut its full-year revenue target
for next-generation products, citing a flat market in Japan and
a product recall in the United States. [nL8N1WW15N]
    Merlin <MERL.L> lost 6.7 percent after its trading update
where the tourist group highlighted a disappointing summer
performance of its Legoland business. [nL8N1WW13N]
     Mapping company TomTom <TOM2.AS> fell 10 percent as worries
over the loss of a contract with Volvo overshadowed a strong
update. [nL8N1WW1LU]
    Volvo <VOLVb.ST> fell 5.3 percent after the Swedish company
warned that some truck engines could be exceeding emission
limits because a component was degrading more quickly than
expected. [nL8N1WW143]

Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italian EU-harmonised consumer prices (HICP) rose 1.7 percent month-on-month in September and were up 1.5 percent from the year earlier, official statistics agency ISTAT said on Tuesday, revising down preliminary data.
    ISTAT's preliminary estimate issued on Sept 28 had pointed to 1.8 percent month-on-month and 1.6 percent year-over-year.
    The 1.5 percent annual rate in September was down from 1.6 percent in August and 1.9 percent in July.
    ISTAT also revised down preliminary data for the main domestic price index (NIC), which fell 0.5 percent on the month (revised from -0.4 percent) and was up 1.4 percent annually (revised from 1.5 percent).
    Core inflation (net of fresh food and energy) was running at 0.7 percent year-on-year on the NIC index in September, down from 0.8 percent in August. No core inflation data is available on the HICP.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May's speech to the UK parliament on Monday has shown that
reaching a deal on the country's exit from the European Union
will be even harder than expected, a senior EU official said on
Tuesday.
    May urged the EU not to allow a stand-off over a 'backstop'
for Ireland to derail Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal
was still achievable. [nL8N1WV31L]
    Her speech and subsequent answers to lawmakers' questions
are not helping the process, the official said.
    ""They demonstrate that finding an agreement will be even
more difficult than one could have expected,"" the official said.
    A summit of EU leaders this week will decide if there is
enough progress for another summit on Brexit in November, the
official said.
    The 27 countries remaining in the bloc after Britain's exit
at the end of March 2019 insist that the economic part of May's
plans for future relations with the EU will not work, the
official said.

    By Michel Rose and Richard Lough
    PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
reshuffled his government on Tuesday, naming the head of his
ruling party to the sensitive post of interior minister and
maintaining a left-right balance as he builds a broad base to
fight the 2019 European elections. 
    Macron's immediate aim is to steady an administration after
a series of resignations that have challenged his authority. He
also wants to inject new energy into his social and economic
reform agenda and reverse a slump in his popularity.
    France's leader had been expected to announce the revamp
last week before postponing it, a delay he said was to ensure
the right decisions were made but which opponents said raised
questions about the depth of experience in his party.
    A Macron aide said there would be no shift in policy
direction.
    ""We have at the same time incoming names with a reputation
in their areas of expertise, which will strengthen the
government's efficiency, and others who have a broader profile,""
the official said.
    Macron and his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, had been
weighing the reshuffle for two weeks following the resignation
of interior minister Gerard Collomb, one of Macron's earliest
backers. Collomb's departure followed two other ministerial
resignations just weeks earlier. [nL8N1WI585]
    In the end, the appointment of Christophe Castaner as
interior minister, moving from the position of head of Macron's
political party, was the only high profile change. 
    Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has spearheaded
Macron's euro zone reform push, and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves
Le Drian retained their posts.
    Nonetheless, other lower profile positions underlined
Macron's ambitions to strengthen the broad base of his
Republique En Marche party as he prepares to go head-to-head
with France's far-right in next May's European elections.
    
    SECOND WIND?
    Didier Guillaume, a former Socialist Party chief whip, moves
into the job of agriculture minister. Franck Riester, a lawmaker
belonging to a group which splintered from the centre-right Les
Republicains after Macron blew apart the traditional mainstream
parties last year, will head the culture ministry.
    Macron's popularity has sunk in recent months as voter
frustration has welled up over a leader many see as arrogant and
the architect of policies that favour the affluent, including
the scrapping of a wealth levy and a cut to corporate taxes.
    The cabinet resignations and a scandal surrounding the
violent conduct of a presidential bodyguard have distracted
Macron, a 40-year-old former investment banker, from his push to
overhaul the pension and unemployment benefit systems.
[nL8N1WQ3HM] 
    Opponents on the left and right have sought to depict Macron
as a leader with diminished star power now paying the price for
centralising authority and decision-making in the hands of a
small inner circle, but he faces no immediate threat. 
    His parliamentary party holds a commanding majority in the
National Assembly, his presidential term runs until 2022, and
the opposition is divided. 
    Analysts, however, said a reshuffle alone may not be enough
to draw a line under the challenging few months.
    ""Past presidential terms have shown that there has been no
tangible benefit from cabinet reshuffles,"" said Jerome Fourquet
of pollster IFOP. ""There is good reason to believe this will be
the same.""

    LONDON/BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister
Theresa May will discuss Brexit with her ministers on Tuesday,
under pressure to rethink her plans from both some members of
her Conservative Party and the European Union.
    A day before May heads to Brussels for a summit, a senior EU
official again made clear that parts of May's plan could not
work and said the time was right to step up plans for Britain
leaving the bloc without a deal. [nB5N1U601F]
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU,
Brexit talks have reached a stalemate over the so-called Irish
backstop, a fallback plan to ensure there is no return to a hard
border between Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
    May told parliament on Monday she would not accept the EU's
proposal for such a backstop because, she said, it could break
up the United Kingdom.
    On Tuesday, a German official repeated the EU's line that
the backstop needed to be legally watertight and without it
there would be no Brexit deal. [nL8N1WV31L] [nS8N1UL000]
    Germany's European Affairs Minister Michael Roth offered
this advice to May: ""Take responsibility and be constructive.""
    But other ministers arriving in Luxembourg for a meeting of
EU ministers pointed to the progress made so far in the Brexit
talks.
    May will update her cabinet of top ministers on the Brexit
negotiations later on Tuesday, aware that some have come under
pressure from Conservative eurosceptic lawmakers to persuade her
to change tack over her so-called Chequers plan.
    Eight of those ministers, some with concerns over Chequers
and plans for a backstop, met late on Monday over pizza to
discuss Brexit, the Telegraph newspaper reported, after reports
that some may resign if May presses ahead.
    May has so far shown little sign of moving away from the
proposal for future ties hashed out at her country residence,
and tried to make clear to lawmakers on Monday that the issue
was now over the backstop - part of Britain's withdrawal terms.
    Talks with the EU reached a stalemate on Sunday, increasing
the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which, some companies say,
could disrupt trade, delay the movement of goods and starve the
world's fifth largest economy of investment.
    EU and British officials suggest it is unlikely that there
will be any agreement on the backstop at this week's summit, but
both are hopeful that progress can be made. 
    ""Even if in this week's debate we are not going to have any
kind of deal, there is still time, there is still possibility to
get a deal,"" Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in
Luxembourg.

    By Liam Proud
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Volvo’s <VOLVb.ST> 
emissions warning is hazard number two for truck investors. The
$31 billion group’s shareholders were already fretting that
demand for heavy-duty commercial vehicles had peaked. When two
dashboard lights are flashing, the safest thing to do is bail.
    The Swedish truck and construction group - not related to
the car brand of the same name - lost about $1.9 billion of
market value on Tuesday after saying it had detected “premature
degradation” of emissions-control kit. The deteriorating
equipment will over time become less efficient at converting
nitrogen oxides into less nasty fumes, meaning “material” costs
to remedy the issue in markets with stringent regulations like
North America and Europe. In the car industry, that usually
means recalls and repairs.
    It’s too soon to judge the scale of those costs, since Volvo
reckons the problem affects various trucks and engines in
different ways. But investors seem to have decided that the
issue is specific to the Swedish group: Volvo’s share price
slide on Tuesday was equivalent to lost earnings of about $180
million, using its 2018 price-earnings multiple of about 10.3
when markets closed on Monday. Shares in Daimler <DAIGn.DE>  and
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, the other main European truckmakers,
rose slightly.
    Shareholders were jumpy already. Volvo’s net revenue surged
by 16 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2018
excluding currency moves, helped by a 15 percent rise in
deliveries of trucks. That growth rate looks unsustainable:
demand in Europe, where Volvo has a 17 percent share of the
heavy-duty truck market, will barely grow this year according to
the company’s published forecasts. 
    European freight volume, a fundamental driver of truck
demand, grew at a sluggish 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the first
eight months of 2018 - slower than last year, according to UBS.
Orders of heavy-duty commercial vehicles have soared in North
America, but that’s led to a huge backlog and has been
accompanied by rising cancellations. Customers cancelled 7,300
trucks in August, according to UBS, equivalent to more than a
tenth of net orders. 
    Analysts reckon Volvo’s revenue will grow a measly 2 percent
in 2019 and shrink the year after, using Refinitiv estimates.
Emissions liability would just twist the knife.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Swedish truckmaker Volvo on Oct. 16 said an emissions
control component was degrading more quickly than expected,
which could cause engines to exceed emission limits for nitrogen
oxides. 
    - The company, which makes trucks, construction equipment,
buses and engines, said it hadn’t completed a full analysis of
the issue but the costs of fixing the problem ""could be
material"". 
    - The largest volume of potentially affected engines were
sold in North America and Europe, the company said. 
    - Volvo shares were down 5.65 percent to 134.30 Swedish
crowns at 0735 GMT on Oct. 16.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Slovenia needs to increase its
productivity in order to be able to raise wages, the
government's macroeconomic institute UMAR said on Tuesday,
suggesting it will advise the government against general wage
hikes without such growth.
    Demand for higher wages has grown in the last year,
particularly in the public sector, partly due to the European
Union member's strong economic growth.
    The institute expects the Slovenian economy to grow 4.4
percent this year after 2017's 4.9 percent expansion, boosted by
higher exports, investments and household spending.
    But productivity in relatively low in Slovenia compared with
elsewhere in the EU.
    ""Slovenia lags behind the average EU productivity by 20
percent. We need to introduce good practices ... to achieve
higher value added and thus enable higher wages,"" the head of
the institute, Bostjan Vasle, told a conference on wages.
    UMAR, which does not represent the government's official
position, also suggested some wages could rise if the government
makes its wage policy more flexible so that people get paid in
line with the results of their labour.
    Police in Slovenia went on strike earlier in October to
demand wage hikes of about 15 percent, and several other public
sector trade unions are threatening industrial action, including
nurses and teachers. [nL8N1WH29V]
    The previous, centre-left government said earlier this year
that the public trade unions' combined wage hike demands
amounted to about 1 billion euros, which was not acceptable. It
did not complete wage talks at that time due to early elections
in June.
    Public sector trade unions resumed their demands for higher
wages as soon as the new minority centre-left government under
Prime Minister Marjan Sarec took power in September. 
    Vasle said public sector wages represent about 25 percent of
budget spending, meaning significant changes to those wages have
a big influence on the budget and the country's fiscal position.
    Slovenia hopes to run a budget surplus of about 0.4 percent
of economic output this year and 0.2 percent in 2019 after eking
out a 0.03 percent surplus in 2017.
    That should make it possible for the country to gradually
reduce the high public debt that built up in the years before a
banking crisis in 2013, when it only narrowly avoided having to
ask for an international bailout.
    The public debt is seen falling to 66.6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2019 from some 70 percent this year,
Finance Minister Andrej Bertoncelj said last week. [nL8N1WR47N]
While on a downward trajectory, that is still above the target
ceiling of 60 percent of GDP set by the EU.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/London-October 16: Fitch Ratings has affirmed German 
life insurer Lebensversicherung von 1871 a. G. Muenchen's (LV 1871) Insurer 
Financial Strength (IFS) Rating at 'A+' (Strong). The Outlook is Stable.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The rating reflects LV 1871's very strong capitalisation, strong asset and 
liability management (ALM) and moderate business profile.  

We expect LV 1871 to maintain a Prism FBM score of at least 'Very Strong' at 
end-2018. The company scored 'Extremely Strong' in our assessment of 
capitalisation according to Fitch's Prism factor-based model (FBM), based on 
end-2017 financials.

Fitch expects LV 1871 to maintain a group Solvency II ratio of more than 300% 
without transitional measures at end-2018. However, the ratio could prove 
volatile if interest rates change. The group reported a regulatory Solvency II 
ratio of 369% without transitional measures at end-2017, which was among the 
highest in the German life insurance market.   

We believe that LV 1871's ability to build additional capital is constrained by 
costs for the additional mathematical reserve Zinszusatzreserve and 
profitability suffering from low investment rates. However, we expect, that LV 
1871's growth in equity and funds for future appropriation will be sufficient to 
maintain the company's capitalisation in 2018, as was the case in 2017.

Fitch expects LV 1871 to maintain a reasonable buffer between the running yield 
in its fixed income portfolio and the rate needed to service guarantees. 
However, the buffer may come under pressure if interest rates resume their 
decline. LV 1871's reinvestment rate for fixed income investments exceeded the 
rate needed to service policyholder guarantees in 1H18 and 2017. Based on our 
calculations, LV 1871's duration gap, a measure of exposure to interest rate 
risk, was 1.3 years at end-2017, which we regard as very strong. 

In Fitch's analysis, LV 1871's business profile is constrained by its size, but 
the company is one of the top 10 insurers in Germany's disability market. The 
disability line contributes strongly to life insurers' diversification in 
Germany. As its earnings are not impacted by low market yields, this line is 
very profitable for German life insurers. 

Due to a large proportion of disability business, LV 1871 is well-positioned to 
mitigate the impact of low market yields. This is because underwriting earnings 
from its disability business can help meet guaranteed interest rate payments for 
the traditional savings business, which we view positively.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The rating will likely be downgraded if LV 1871's capital position depletes, to 
the extent that the Prism FBM score falls to the low end of the 'Very Strong' 
category. Additionally, the rating could be downgraded, if Fitch expects 
reinvestment rates for fixed income investments to be below liability guarantees 
on a sustained basis.

The rating could also be downgraded if LV 1871's strong franchise in the 
disability line deteriorates.

Due to the company's moderate business profile and the challenging operating 
environment for German life insurers we consider an upgrade in the near to 
medium term as unlikely.

    MIDDAY SNAPSHOT: DIP BUYERS' MOOD IMPROVING (1219 GMT) 
    Mood has clearly improved throughout the session and euro zone equities <.STOXXE> are now up
on a high, up 1 percent while U.S. futures are firmly in positive territory. 
    Seems like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's strong performance in equity trading has
something to do with higher spirits. See [nL3N1WW3L4] [nL3N1WW3V2]     
    Quite a shift from this morning's cautious mood. 
    ""It doesn't look like investors are rushing in just yet,"" noted IG's Chris Beauchamp a few
hours ago, cautioning that ""a fresh selloff remains likely"". 
    ""An ‘After you, Claude’ approach seems to apply,"" he wrote using the catchphrase of RAF
pilots about to begin an attack.
    Another colourful expression was Nicolas Cheron, from Binck.fr who told his clients ""it was
urgent to wait"".    
    Time to jump back in?

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES BUILD ON RECOVERY (0751 GMT)
    In early deals, European shares are climbing 0.4 percent with defensive sectors utilities,
telecoms and real estate, as well as autos, leading the way. 
    Merlin meanwhile is down 7.7 percent, set for its worst day in a year after warning about 
rising costs from labour and regulation. [nL8N1WW13N]
    British American Tobacco shares are down just 1.2 percent but the heavyweight is weighing on
the FTSE, after it cut its forecast for revenues from non-cigarette products.
    Broker notes are also moving some stocks.
    Kion shares are up 10.2 percent, top of the STOXX after UBS upgraded it to ""buy"", saying a
recent pullback has taken the shares down too far. ""While we were previously concerned that the
market could overrate the structural growth in warehouse automation and underrate the cyclical
challenges in trucks, we think it is now likely the opposite on both counts,"" they write. 
    Ocado is also up 4.5 percent with traders citing a double upgrade to ""buy"" from BAML.
    Italy's FTSE MIB is up 1.4 percent, outperforming the rest as Italian bond yields fall on
encouraging comments from Tria.

    ON OUR RADAR: UPDATES FROM BAT, MEGGITT, TOMTOM (0651 GMT)
    European shares are set to stabilise above 22-month lows hit in the previous session as the
focus turns from the upset caused by a steep surge in U.S. yields to the start of the reporting
season which is expected to deliver double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter.
    Futures on main euro zone benchmarks were trading up 0.1 percent, while FTSE futures were
lagging a tad behind amid uncertainty surrounding Brexit talks.
    In earning updates, British American Tobacco <BATS.L> cut its full-year revenue target for
next-generation products, citing a flat market in Japan and a product recall in the United
States. On a more positive note, engineer Meggitt raised its estimate for 2018 organic revenue
growth thanks to higher demand for its wheels, brakes, fuel tanks and other aeroplane parts,
while TomTom posted a stronger-than-expected rise in third-quarter core earnings.
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report this week. Overall, third quarter
earnings for the index are expected to have risen 14 percent on revenues up 7.4 percent,
according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data, while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That
compares to the 21.6 percent growth seen for US companies.

    HEADLINES ROUNDUP: EARNINGS START TO FLOW IN (0559 GMT)
    It looks there is no big corporate news that could shake markets this morning, although the
European earnings season is starting to see the first releases with results coming in from
TomTom <TOM2.AS> and Talanx <TLXGn.DE>. 
    About 6 percent of STOXX 600 companies are due to report this week. Overall, third quarter
earnings are expected to have risen 14 percent on revenues up 7.4 percent, according to
Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
    Telecoms could also continue to draw attention after Deutsche Telekom said it was confident
it will secure EU antitrust approval to buy Tele2's Dutch business.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPE SET TO STABILISE ABOVE 22-MONTH LOWS (0512 GMT)
    European shares are expected to rise slightly at the open today, further stabilising
following a turbulent week that pushed them to 22-month lows, as investors reacted to a steep
rise in U.S. Treasury yields and fresh political worries. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 1 point higher at 7,031, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 30 points higher at 11,644 and Paris' CAC to open 8 points higher at 5,103.
    In Asia, stocks rose modestly, gaining a firmer footing after a week of heavy losses,
although increasing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the West fanned geopolitical concerns and
capped gains. [nL3N1WW1Q8]

    Oct 16 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> said on Tuesday
it had applied for an investment firm license in France as part
of a Brexit strategy that will shift its servicing of European
mainland customers out of London.
    The San Francisco-based bank, whose purchase of a
high-profile location near the Bank of England two years ago was
seen as a vote of confidence in the Brexit process, said it
would continue to service UK and non-EU clients from London.
    It said its new subsidiary based in Paris would provide
capital markets and investment banking services for European and
international customers who require access to the EU and the
European Economic Area. 
    The company gave no indication whether the move would lead
to job cuts in London or how many it would employ in Paris. A
spokesperson did not immediately provide details on how many
employees Well Fargo has in London.
   ""With Brexit on the horizon, Wells Fargo is committed to
providing a transition, which is as seamless as possible, for
its markets and investment banking customers,"" said Alicia
Reyes, head of Wells Fargo Securities for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa.

    French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in July that the
country would ease financial regulations to EU minimums and
introduce new tax incentives to make Paris a more attractive

    Paris is competing with the likes of Frankfurt, Dublin and
Luxembourg to win over finance jobs in the wake of Britain’s
departure from the EU next March.
    The Paris Europlace financial sector lobby said in July that
Paris was set to win 3,500 financial sector jobs leaving Britain
due to Brexit.
    HSBC <HSBA.L> would make up the bulk, with 1,000 jobs, while
French banks moving posts back to their base in Paris would add
another 1,000 jobs. The rest would come from a host of Wall
Street banks and other financial firms, the lobby had said.
    Companies from across the EU use London for currency
trading, derivatives and managing investment funds. 
    Some EU policymakers want parts of these activities shifted
to the continent after Brexit to avoid relying on what will then
be a foreign financial center.
    Wells Fargo said it will make more announcements on its
Brexit strategy in the near future.

Brexit deal between the European Union  and Britain that would
maintain an open Irish border, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon
Coveney said on Tuesday.
    As chances for a Brexit breakthrough at an EU leaders'
summit on Wednesday and Thursday have receded, Coveney said he
expected no big decisions since negotiators from both sides
needed time to get back to talks and see where they go. 
    Coveney added that the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier
reassured him of the bloc's unwavering solidarity with Ireland.
Coveney said that the Brexit deal must include an emergency fix
that would be valid ""unless and until"" the open Irish border is
ensured ahead by a new EU-UK trade deal after Brexit.

    By Gergely Szakacs and Krisztina  Than
    BUDAPEST, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank (NBH)
kept its key interest rates on hold at record lows on Tuesday in
the face of market concerns about rising inflation and
reiterated it was prepared for a future normalisation of its
policy [nL8N1WV4DA].
    Central Europe's most dovish central bank left its base rate
at 0.9 percent and its overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent
<NBHI>, both in line with the median forecasts of analysts in a
Reuters poll [nL8N1WS39D].
    ""The Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious
normalisation of monetary policy, which will start depending on
the outlook for inflation,"" the Monetary Council said in its
statement after the rate decision, reiterating its September
message.
    ""The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a
sustainable manner from mid-2019. To ensure this ... maintaining
the current level of the base rate and the loose monetary
conditions is necessary,"" it said.
    At 1315 GMT, the forint <EURHUF=D3> traded at 321.75 versus
the euro, a touch firmer than 321.83 before the announcement. 
    The bank has stuck to its dovish stance even as some other
central banks in Central Europe started raising interest rates.
    It revamped its policy tools in September to prepare for a
gradual policy normalisation but stopping short of saying when
this could start.
    Headline inflation picked up to 3.6 percent in September
from 3.4 percent in August, the highest rate since January 2013,
but still within the NBH's 2 to 4 percent target range.
    Although the September inflation figures were within the
target range, the NBH also needs to watch central bankers in the
United States, the euro zone and the region.
    In its statement the NBH said inflationary pressures from
wages remained moderate and inflation expectations were anchored
at a low level.
    The bank said inflation would stay above 3 percent for now
because an increase in excise taxes would add upward pressure on
inflation, in addition to fuel and unprocessed food prices.
    ""As temporary effects fade, the inflation rate is expected
to ease back again, and the rise in underlying inflation will
ensure that inflation meets the 3 percent target in a
sustainable structure from mid-2019,"" it added.
    A rise in interest rates elsewhere can weaken the forint if
Hungarian interest rates stay low, which can generate additional
inflation and more forint weakness, some analysts said.
    Some analysts expect the base rate to start to rise from 0.9
percent next year, but their median forecasts show an unchanged
rate for the end of 2019, before a rise to 1.5 percent in 2020

leaders Donald Tusk said he hoped EU governments can still make
visible progress in reforming the single currency area by
December despite a eurosceptic government in Italy that wants to
break EU budget rules.
    ""I hope that positive progress is still possible and that is
why I decided to organise the euro summit,"" Tusk told a news
conference on Tuesday, referring to a meeting on Thursday in
Brussels devoted to euro zone reform.
    The populist government in Rome presented its draft budget
for 2019 to the European Commission on Monday proposing a budget
deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, three times as high as the number
agreed with the Commission by the previous Italian government.
    The Commission has said such a draft budget plan would
significantly depart from the agree fiscal path and is likely to
send the draft back to Rome asking it to be revised.
    At the same time the 19 countries sharing the euro want to
integrate more deeply in economic terms, by giving more powers
to their bailout fund ESM, setting up a euro zone budget and a
euro zone-wide deposit insurance scheme.
    The consent of Italy, the euro zone's third biggest economy,
is necessary for the process to go forward. EU leaders have been
aiming to find an agreement on the reforms in December. 
    ""Of course we have to be realistic and frank. I am
absolutely aware that the atmosphere is more tricky than in
June, but I think we can use the time before December to clarify
the position of some member states and our goal remains to have
visible progress in December,"" Tusk said.

union will stage a 24-hour walkout on November 14 to demand wage
and pension increases, hirings and tax cuts, the first major
strike since the country exited its bailout programme in August.
    Greeks have endured years of punishing austerity including
tax hikes and deep spending cuts in return for international
loans since its debt crisis erupted in 2009.
    The left-led government, which faces elections next year,
has promised to keep tight control of public finances after the
end of the bailout, raising the stakes in its standoff with the
ADEDY labour union that has organised the strike.
    ""Now that we've become a normal country with a normal
government which is no longer supervised by foreign powers, now
is the time to try to solve some of the problems created in the
past eight years,"" ADEDY president Yannis Paidas told Reuters. 
    ""Public sector workers want their dignity back, we need to
recoup some of our losses.""
    ADEDY represents about half a million workers but turnout in
protests has been low in recent years.  
    Even though the bailout has ended, Greece will be loath to
go on a spending spree any time soon - it still has to generate
high budget surpluses under a post-bailout surveilance plan
agreed with the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
    The strike will also be against privatisations and the
evaluation process of public sector workers, ADEDY said.
    Greece's private sector union GSEE is also mulling a strike
but has not yet decided on a possible date.
    The economy shrank by about a quarter during the eight-year
crisis. It has now returned to growth and the jobless rate has
dropped to 19 percent from a record high of nearly 28 percent in
2013, but is still the highest in the euro zone. 
    The government, which signed up to a new bailout in 2015
despite pre-election promises to end austerity, has pledged to
protect workers and pensioners from any further cuts, but
without derailing the country's fiscal performance. 
    It submitted its first post-bailout budget to parliament
this month pending approval by its lenders. [nL8N1WH601]

    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European Council President
Donald Tusk said on Tuesday he will ask British Prime Minister
Theresa May this week if she has new ideas on how to break the
impasse in Brexit talks, adding that he has become less
optimistic about an immediate breakthrough.
    Tusk told reporters his hopes for their meeting on Wednesday
had been dampened by European Union Brexit negotiator Michel
Barnier, as well as events in the British parliament.
    ""Unfortunately the report on the state of the negotiations
that I got from Michel Barnier today, as well as yesterday's
debate in the House of Commons, give me no grounds for optimism
before tomorrow's European Council on Brexit,"" said Tusk, who
will chair the EU summit in Brussels.
    A breakthrough required more than just goodwill. ""Tomorrow,
I'm going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete
proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can
determine if a breakthrough is possible,"" he said.
    EU leaders, meeting from Wednesday evening, had hoped to
reach a provisional deal over Britain's exit from the EU in
March before signing off on a withdrawal agreement at a special
Brexit summit in November. 
    Tusk said the November meeting would make sense only if
there were a feeling of being really close to a breakthrough.
    The talks are stuck over the issue of the border between the
British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and
have not resumed since Sunday.
    Tusk likened the issue to the Gordian Knot, cut in legend by
Alexander the Great, saying ""It is not so easy to find this kind
of creative leader.""
    Leaders, he said, would step up their preparations for a
no-deal Brexit. ""A no-deal scenario becomes more likely than
ever before, but it doesn't mean it is our political priority.""

    * But he faces calls to quit after Bavaria election flop
    * SPD blames CSU for ruling coalition's poor image

 (adds pressure for him to go)
    By Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
leading critic in her coalition government said on Tuesday he
wanted the ruling alliance to work, batting away calls for his
own resignation after a dismal result for his party in Bavaria's
regional election.
    Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social
Union (CSU), has been a thorn in Merkel's side since 2015, with
criticism of her decision to open German borders to almost
onemillion refugees, most of them fleeing war in the Middle
East.
    But the CSU's disastrous performance on Sunday - its weakest
since 1950 - has raised questions about whether he should stand
down as party leader and interior minister in the national
government.
    The calls grew louder on Tuesday, with a senior member of
the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in
Merkel's coalition, calling Seehofer ""miscast"" as interior
minister and a senior CSU figure suggesting he should step down.
    Seehofer dismissed the idea of resigning, telling a news
conference his work in politics ""is fun"". He said the CSU,
sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), would
act as a stable force in her ruling 'grand' coalition.
    ""I have no inclination at all for minority governments, or
fresh elections and everything that can come with them,"" he
added.
    ""This grand coalition must simply get on with reputable work
and communicate it properly.In the CSU, we will do everything
for the grand coalition to stay,"" Seehofer said.
    Thomas Oppermann, a senior member of the SPD, described
Horst Seehofer as behaving like a ""hooligan"" as interior
minister and said he was miscast in that role.
    The CSU leader was to blame for the ruling coalition's poor
image, he said.
    
    PITFALLS AHEAD
    CSU honourary chairman Theo Waigel also suggested Seehofer
should go: ""Everyone has to decide for themselves how to make a
graceful, personally responsible departure from politics,"" he
told the Ausburger Allgemeine.
    Before the Bavaria vote, the CSU pushed the coalition -
Merkel's fourth and probably final government - close to
collapsing twice, first in an argument over immigration and then
in a scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster.
    The CDU/CSU conservative alliance only teamed up with the
SPD to form the ruling coalition in March following an
inconclusive national election and the collapse of negotiations
between the conservatives and two smaller parties.
    SPD members are still bitter over their leaders' decision to
join the government after promising before the 2017 election to
sit in opposition if they lost to the conservatives. They are
now demanding consequences.
    The leader of the SPD's Jusos youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert,
said his party should give the conservatives an ultimatum:
achieve progress on issues such as policy on diesel cars and
reducing arms exports, or else the SPD quits the government.
    ""Deal or no deal, that must be the clear message to the
Union parties,"" he told the Handelsblatt business daily,
referring to the CDU/CSU alliance.
    Merkel, who has been in office since 2005 and is Europe's
most powerful leader, faces further potential pitfalls this year
in the form of a CDU conclave and the party's annual congress in
  early December.
    The chancellor, 64, has won support from key conservatives
in her bid for re-election as CDU chairwoman at the congress.
But this could change if the CDU loses power in the western
region of Hesse in another state election on Oct. 28.

    Oct 16 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> said on Tuesday
it had applied for an investment firm license in France as part
of a Brexit strategy to shift some of its servicing of European
mainland customers out of London.
    The San Francisco-based bank, whose purchase of a
high-profile location near the Bank of England two years ago was
seen as a vote of confidence in the Brexit process, said it
would continue to service UK and non-EU clients from London.
    The company said a new subsidiary based in Paris would
provide capital markets and investment banking services for
European and international customers who require access to the
EU and the European Economic Area. 
    The company gave no indication whether the move would lead
to job cuts in London or how many it would employ in Paris. A
spokesperson said the company employs about 1,000 people at its
London office.
    ""With Brexit on the horizon, Wells Fargo is committed to
providing a transition, which is as seamless as possible, for
its markets and investment banking customers,"" said Alicia
Reyes, head of Wells Fargo Securities for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa.
    The new Paris-based unit will be called Wells Fargo

    French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in July that the
country would ease financial regulations to EU minimums and
introduce new tax incentives to make Paris a more attractive
finance hub. (https://reut.rs/2PCDGek)
    Paris is competing with the likes of Frankfurt, Dublin and
Luxembourg to win over finance jobs in the wake of Britain’s
departure from the EU next March.
    The Paris Europlace financial sector lobby said in July that
Paris was set to win 3,500 financial sector jobs leaving Britain
due to Brexit.
    HSBC <HSBA.L> would make up the bulk, with 1,000 jobs, while
French banks moving posts back to their base in Paris would add
another 1,000 jobs. The rest would come from a host of Wall
Street banks and other financial firms, the lobby had said.
    Companies from across the EU use London for currency
trading, derivatives and managing investment funds. 
    Some EU policymakers want parts of these activities shifted
to the continent after Brexit to avoid relying on what will then
be a foreign financial center.
    Wells Fargo said it will make more announcements on its
Brexit strategy in the near future.
     Shares of the company, which reported a
better-than-expected profit last week, were down marginally in
late morning trading.

with privatisations to improve its competitiveness and reform
its pension system over the medium-term, a senior official at
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said
on Tuesday.
    ""Privatisation is really important for overall productivity
in the economy and raising the level of competitiveness,""
Charlotte Ruhe, EBRD Managing Director for Central and South
Eastern Europe, said in an interview during a visit to
Ljubljana.
    She welcomed the fact that the new centre-left government,
which took power in September, has already started privatising
state-owned banks Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Abanka, adding she
expected further selloffs in the coming years.
    Ruhe, after holding meetings with government officials, said
the government was likely to sell some tourism firms and could
start privatisation of the largest telecoms operator, Telekom
Slovenia, in the second half of 2019. 
    She also said the government would have to reform the
pension system to ease the burden of a rapidly ageing population
on the state budget, giving no further details.
    Earlier on Tuesday the government's macroeconomic institute
UMAR said Slovenia should increase productivity in order to be
able to meet public sector unions' demands for higher wages.

Xavier Bettel will seek to re-form his liberal-led coalition
after an election on Sunday gave the three ruling parties just
enough seats to remain in government.
    Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri asked Bettel to form the next
government on Tuesday, noting in a statement that Bettel's
Democratic Party, the Socialist Workers Party (LSAP) and the
Greens had expressed a desire to start coalition negotiations.
    Opinion polls before Sunday's election had indicated the
Christian Social People's Party (CSV) - which was led for 19
years by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker - would end
Bettel's five-year term as prime minister.
    The CSV was again the largest party, but actually lost
seats, as did the LSAP and the Democratic Party. However,
because the Greens gained, the three parties in government have
31 seats in the 60-seat chamber. [nL8N1WU0CZ]
    The CSV was pushed out of government for only the second
time since World War Two in a snap election Juncker called in
2013 after a wire-tapping scandal.
    Unlike some neighbouring countries, where migration has
boosted anti-immigrant parties, the far right has not made
inroads in Luxembourg.
    However, in 2015 Luxembourgers decisively rejected giving
the vote to the 48 percent of the population who are foreigners,
mostly from Portugal, France and other EU countries.
    Whatever the future government, the foreign policy of the
European Union's wealthiest but second-smallest state is
unlikely to change much.

Barnier hoped that progress could be made especially next month

that have hurt its foreign commerce.

policies, including a complex web of currency controls and heavy
state intervention in the economy.
    ""The President has instructed the finance minister to begin
a new correspondence scheme in Europe and Asia for public
banks,"" El Aissami said. 
    He added that the government will sell 2 billion euros

$8.825 billion, two-thirds of which are held in gold bars.

without providing a detailed breakdown. 
    In August, Maduro devalued the bolivar currency by 96
percent, hiked taxes and raised the minimum wage. But the moves
have not dented inflation, which the International Monetary Fund
forecasts at 1.4 million percent this year and 10 million
percent next year. [nL1N1V900V][nL2N1WP0KA]

 (Recasts with Macron's statement)
    By Michel Rose and Richard Lough
    PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron
on Tuesday struck a self-critical tone about his governing style
and a string of political missteps after reshuffling his
government in an effort to reinvigorate his reform agenda.
    Earlier, Macron named the head of his ruling party,
Christophe Castaner, to the sensitive post of interior minister,
moving to steady his administration after a series of
resignations that have challenged the president's authority.   
    ""These last few months may have blurred the direction,""
Macron said in a pre-recorded broadcast to the nation from his
office at the Elysee presidential palace.
    ""My determination and my plain-speaking may have upset or
shocked some of you, and I hear the criticisms,"" he said.
    Macron's sharp tongue - he berated striking workers for
""kicking up a bloody mess"" and called critics of his labour law
reforms ""slackers"" - has prompted accusations that he is an
arrogant and patronising head of state.
    Shortly before resigning two weeks ago as interior minister,
Gerard Collomb, one of Macron's earliest supporters, criticised
what he called the president's ""lack of humility"" and warned of
hubris, a viewpoint opinion polls show is shared by many voters.
    Although he offered no apology, Macron struck a more humble
tone in his TV statement, pledging to set aside the ""poison of
division and instability"" and inject new energy into his social
and economic reform agenda.
    ""I know there is impatience, I share it,"" he said.
""Gradually, I'm sure, your daily life will get better because
the government is on the right track and, above all, is getting
to the root of problems.""
    
    LONG-AWAITED RESHUFFLE
    Macron had been expected to announce the cabinet revamp last
week before postponing it, a delay he said was to ensure the
right decisions were made but which opponents said raised
questions about the depth of experience in his party.
    Macron and his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, had been
weighing the reshuffle for two weeks following Collomb's
resignation. His departure followed two other ministerial
resignations just weeks earlier. [nL8N1WI585]
    In the end, the appointment of Castaner, moving from the
position of head of Macron's political party, was the only
high-profile change. 
    Nonetheless, other lower profile positions underlined
Macron's ambitions to strengthen the broad base of his
Republique En Marche party as he prepares to go head-to-head
with France's far-right in next May's European elections.
    Didier Guillaume, a former Socialist Party chief whip, moved
into the job of agriculture minister. Franck Riester, a lawmaker
belonging to a group which splintered from the centre-right Les
Republicains after Macron blew apart the traditional mainstream
parties last year, will head the culture ministry.
    Macron's popularity has sunk in recent months, dented partly
by a sense among some voters that his policies - including the
scrapping of a wealth levy and a cut in corporate taxes - favour
the affluent.
    The cabinet resignations and a scandal surrounding the
violent conduct of a presidential bodyguard have distracted
Macron, a 40-year-old former investment banker, from his push to
overhaul the pension and unemployment benefit systems.
[nL8N1WQ3HM] 
    Opponents on the left and right have sought to depict Macron
as a leader with diminished star power now paying the price for
centralising authority and decision-making in the hands of a
small inner circle, but he faces no immediate threat. 
    His parliamentary party holds a commanding majority in the
National Assembly, his presidential term runs until 2022, and
the opposition is divided. 
    Analysts, however, said a reshuffle alone may not be enough
to draw a line under the challenging few months.
    ""Past presidential terms have shown that there has been no
tangible benefit from cabinet reshuffles,"" said Jerome Fourquet
of pollster IFOP. ""There is good reason to believe this will be
the same.""

    PHNOM PENH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A European Union decision to
ramp up trade pressure on Cambodia has alarmed unions in its
garment industry, a pillar of the economy that employs about
700,000 people, but a key grouping of manufacturers said the
risk would take months to materialise.

    Some Western countries have criticised a July election won
by Prime Minister Hun Sen, calling it flawed, because of a
campaign of intimidation by his allies, and the lack of a
credible opposition dissolved by the Supreme Court.
    The repercussions could devastate garment exports that
account for about 40 percent of Cambodia's gross domestic
product (GDP), and industries such as sugar.

president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers'
Democratic Union.

    PRODUCERS OPTIMISTIC
    Cambodia's $7-billion apparel industry is the largest formal
employer among a population of 15 million.
    ""It will be difficult if the EBA is suspended,"" said Hoeun
Tharith, 42, a shoe factory worker and father of three, adding
that he shrank from the consequences of losing his monthly
income of about $210.    
    Yet the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia
(GMAC), which represents 600 factories, is optimistic.
    The threat of tariffs was still months away and would be the
subject of a six-month EU review, said Kaing Monika, the
grouping's deputy secretary general. 
    ""At this point, nobody can guarantee what the outcome will
be and whether it will result in a substantial loss,"" Kaing
Monika told Reuters. 
    ""What we are more concerned about is the media speculation
leading to reduced confidence from buyers and investors ... the
actual situation might be much less frightening.""
    Some say it is too soon to tell if buyers will pull out and
turn to lower-cost Asian rivals.
    Sweden's H&M, which sources from 62 factories in Cambodia,
said it understood the need to look into the rights situation,
but urged the European Union to also weigh the impact on
workers.
    ""Potential negative effects on the employment for the people
in the garment industry must be taken into consideration,"" it
said in a statement to Reuters, without saying if it planned to
pull out of Cambodia.
    Costs are lower in neighbouring Vietnam, another
garment-making hub, where the minimum wage ranges from $114 to
$165.
    This advantage will only improve after a hike of seven
percent takes effect in Cambodia's textiles and footwear
industry in January, pushing the corresponding figure to $182.
    ""Of course if companies move Vietnam might benefit a little
bit,"" Dang Phuong Dung, a former official of the Vietnam Textile
and Apparel Association, told Reuters.

    PHNOM PENH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A European Union decision to
ramp up trade pressure on Cambodia has alarmed unions in its
garment industry, a pillar of the economy that employs about
700,000 people, but a key grouping of manufacturers said the
risk would take months to materialise.
    Cambodia's biggest export market, the EU, warned this month
that the Southeast Asian nation would lose special access to the
world's largest trading bloc, in a punitive response to its move
away from democracy. [nL8N1WL2JW]
    Some Western countries have criticised a July election won
by Prime Minister Hun Sen, calling it flawed, because of a
campaign of intimidation by his allies, and the lack of a
credible opposition dissolved by the Supreme Court.
    The repercussions could devastate garment exports that
account for about 40 percent of Cambodia's gross domestic
product (GDP), and industries such as sugar.
    ""The European market is an important one,"" said At Thon, the
president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers'
Democratic Union.
    ""If factories close their doors, it will be hard.""

    By Aaron Ross
    DAKAR, Oct 17 (Reuters) - When Central African Republic
(CAR) pleaded for help last year to fight marauding militias,
former colonial ruler France offered guns it had seized off
Somalia. But Russia objected and donated its own weapons
instead.
    By early February, Russia had sent nine planes with weapons
along with dozens of contractors to train local soldiers and
secure mining projects, marking the start of its highest-profile
military foray in sub-Saharan Africa for decades.
    Muscling in on a country dominated by France for years
served as a statement of intent about Moscow's renewed push for
global prestige and influence, and is part of a wider campaign
shaking up long-standing power dynamics on the continent.
    Since Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea
in 2014, Moscow has signed 19 military cooperation deals in
sub-Saharan Africa, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe, according to its foreign and defence ministries and
state media.
    The continent's 54 member states at the United Nations –
three of which sit on the Security Council at any given time –
 form the organisation's largest voting bloc and one of its most
coherent, making them attractive allies for Russia. 
    ""The West is not very much loved by many countries. And many
(see) Russia as the country that will oppose the West,"" said
Dmitri Bondarenko, an anthropologist and historian at Russia's
Institute for African Studies.
    Besides sending arms and contractors to CAR, Russian
national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to President
Faustin-Archange Touadera and Russia's defence ministry said
last week it planned to establish a five-person team at CAR's
defence ministry.
    Russia's moves come at a time when the defence ministry's
influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing against a
backdrop of heightened tension with the West. [nL8N1WL4IY] 
    
    SEIZED WEAPONS
    When CAR made its plea in 2017, there was recognition that a
spike in ethnic fighting could turn into a far larger conflict
and that its security forces were too weak to tackle myriad
armed groups. [nL8N1LP2QI]
    CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons
shipments must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR
sanctions committee, made up of the Council's 15 members,
including France and Russia. It operates by consensus.
    France first offered to help CAR buy old weapons but the
proposal was too expensive. France then offered 1,400 AK47
assault rifles it had seized off Somalia in 2016, according to a
Security Council memo and four diplomats.
    Russia objected on the grounds that weapons seized for
breaching the U.N. arms embargo on Somalia could not be recycled
for use in another country under embargo, two diplomats said.
    But mindful of the need for a quick solution, the sanctions
committee approved Moscow's donation of AK47s, sniper rifles,
machineguns and grenade launchers in December, according to
committee documents and diplomats.
    ""We presented our problem and Russia offered to help us,
subject to Security Council approval,"" said Albert Yaloke
Mokpeme, CAR's presidential spokesman. ""If peace is restored
tomorrow in CAR, I think everyone will be happy.""
    Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for
comment about committee proceedings. 
    France's foreign ministry said Russia must strictly respect
the terms of its arms embargo exemption to keep the weapons out
of the wrong hands.
    
    'WE'RE NOT INTERESTED'
    During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged close military
and diplomatic ties with many African countries. It was involved
in proxy wars in states such as Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique
and helped independence movements fight Western colonial powers.
    Russia is now trying to revive some of the relationships
that lapsed after the Soviet Union's collapse. It joins a number
of countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates looking
to set up bases in Africa, mediate in diplomatic stand-offs and
strike business deals. [nL5N1UT0GU] [nL8N1MB0CN]
    China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but
it has shied away from any military involvement. It did go a
step further last year, however, opening its first military base
outside China in Djibouti. 
    Near the world's busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also
home to a large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an
Italian camp and Japan's only overseas base.
    Djibouti blocked Russian attempts to set up a base, however,
saying it wanted to avoid becoming the terrain for a proxy war.
Moscow is now planning to build a logistics centre at a port in
neighbouring Eritrea. [nR4N1VI01N]
    While France has a military bases outside Djibouti in former
colonies Gabon, Ivory Coast and Senegal and its soldiers also
operate in Chad, Mali and Niger, analysts say Washington's
influence is on the wane. 
    Its trade with the continent has halved in the past decade,
though much of that is due to U.S. shale replacing oil imports
from Africa. Diplomatic posts have gone unfilled and a task
force based in CAR tracking warlord Joseph Kony left last year.
    ""Our actions on the diplomatic and military side have sent a
huge signal to our partners that we're not interested in
Africa,"" said Donald Bolduc, who commanded U.S. special forces
across the continent until last year.
    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor
Nagy said Washington's commitment to Africa was unwavering but,
""there is space for other countries to play a positive role in
the region"".
    
    AFRICAN DEALS
    As part of Russia's renewed push, Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in March, attended a
summit in South Africa in June and visited Rwanda, chair of the
African Union, this year.
    Russia has also struck military cooperation deals with many
African countries since 2015, though some have yet to come into
force. The agreements typically involve providing weapons and
training in areas such as counter-terrorism and piracy.
[nL8N1WQ54N]
    Analysts caution that the deals often appear more symbolic
than transformative and say it's not clear if Russia has the
resources, or desire, to continue expanding its presence.
    But as in the Cold War, military deals can come alongside
economic links, such as mining and energy agreements. Ethiopia
signed its deal in April, a month after Lavrov visited to
discuss nuclear energy, agriculture and transportation projects.
    Russian firms have signed mineral deals in Sudan, which
cooperates with Moscow in defence technology, and Russia is
looking at diamond and platinum projects in Zimbabwe as well as
energy projects in Chad. [nL5N1QQ30K]
    Over the past decade, Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa
has increased fast, albeit from a low base. From 2010-2017,
total trade rose to $4.2 billion a year from $1.6 billion,
according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies https://www.csis.org.
 
    During the same period, China's total trade with sub-Saharan
Africa nearly doubled to $165 billion while U.S. trade more than
halved to $37 billion.
    
    WAGNER GROUP
    Since arriving in CAR, the Russians' remit has expanded
beyond military advice and into various economic and diplomatic
activities, a Western diplomat and security source said,
fuelling the beginnings of a Western backlash.
    In August, France, the United Kingdom and the United States
blocked a Russian request to send more weapons. The U.S. mission
to the United Nations said in a note to the sanctions committee
that it was awaiting, ""confirmation that measures had been taken
to ensure the secure management of the previous donation"".
    Estimates of the number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from
250 to 1,000. Touadera's spokesman declined to provide details,
nor say what activities the Russians were engaged in. 
    Yevgeny Shabayev, head of a chapter of a paramilitary
Cossack organisation who has ties to Russian security
contractors, said there could be 1,000 in CAR and 5,000 to
10,000 across Africa, including in Sudan, South Sudan and Libya.
    One Russian private military contractor, the Wagner group,
was thrust into the spotlight in July when three Russian
journalists were killed in CAR while investigating its alleged
presence there. [nL5N1UR790]
    Reuters has been unable to confirm whether Wagner
contractors are in CAR. People with ties to the group have told
Reuters it has carried out clandestine combat missions on the
Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine and Syria.
    Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their
orders. They have denied any role in the journalists' deaths. 
    Russia has also stepped into negotiations with militias in
CAR, adding to Western misgivings about its presence.
    According to a U.N. panel of experts, Touadera's Russian
adviser has met militia leaders several times to discuss
disarmament and the distribution of natural resources revenue.
    Russia said in August after brokering talks between armed
groups that Touadera had expressed gratitude for its involvement
and that it intended to continue its mediation.
    Reuters was unable to contact the adviser, Zakharov, for
comment. 
    ""There is a real division between that guy and the rest of
the presidential advisers,"" the security source said. ""When you
ask, 'Can we see your colleague?' they say, 'Who, our colleague?
We don't know him'.""

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

    * Russia supplied weapons and contractors to CAR in 2018
    * Russia had objected to French proposal to help CAR forces
    * Russia one of several countries seeking footholds in
Africa
    * Russian military deals in Africa since 2014: [nL8N1WQ54N]

    By Aaron Ross
    DAKAR, Oct 17 (Reuters) - When Central African Republic
(CAR) pleaded for help last year to fight marauding militias,
former colonial ruler France offered guns it had seized off
Somalia. But Russia objected and donated its own weapons
instead.
    By early February, Russia had sent nine planes with weapons
along with dozens of contractors to train local soldiers and
secure mining projects, marking the start of its highest-profile
military foray in sub-Saharan Africa for decades.
    Muscling in on a country dominated by France for years
served as a statement of intent about Moscow's renewed push for
global prestige and influence, and is part of a wider campaign
shaking up long-standing power dynamics on the continent.
    Since Western nations sanctioned Russia for annexing Crimea
in 2014, Moscow has signed 19 military cooperation deals in
sub-Saharan Africa, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe, according to its foreign and defence ministries and
state media.
    The continent's 54 member states at the United Nations –
three of which sit on the Security Council at any given time –
 form the organisation's largest voting bloc and one of its most
coherent, making them attractive allies for Russia. 
    ""The West is not very much loved by many countries. And many
(see) Russia as the country that will oppose the West,"" said
Dmitri Bondarenko, an anthropologist and historian at Russia's
Institute for African Studies.
    Besides sending arms and contractors to CAR, Russian
national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to President
Faustin-Archange Touadera and Russia's defence ministry said
last week it planned to establish a five-person team at CAR's
defence ministry.
    Russia's moves come at a time when the defence ministry's
influence over Kremlin foreign policy is growing against a
backdrop of heightened tension with the West. [nL8N1WL4IY] 
    
    SEIZED WEAPONS
    When CAR made its plea in 2017, there was recognition that a
spike in ethnic fighting could turn into a far larger conflict
and that its security forces were too weak to tackle myriad
armed groups. [nL8N1LP2QI]
    CAR has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 so weapons
shipments must be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR
sanctions committee, made up of the Council's 15 members,
including France and Russia. It operates by consensus.
    France first offered to help CAR buy old weapons but the
proposal was too expensive. France then offered 1,400 AK47
assault rifles it had seized off Somalia in 2016, according to a
Security Council memo and four diplomats.
    Russia objected on the grounds that weapons seized for
breaching the U.N. arms embargo on Somalia could not be recycled
for use in another country under embargo, two diplomats said.
    But mindful of the need for a quick solution, the sanctions
committee approved Moscow's donation of AK47s, sniper rifles,
machineguns and grenade launchers in December, according to
committee documents and diplomats.
    ""We presented our problem and Russia offered to help us,
subject to Security Council approval,"" said Albert Yaloke
Mokpeme, CAR's presidential spokesman. ""If peace is restored
tomorrow in CAR, I think everyone will be happy.""
    Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for
comment about committee proceedings. 
    France's foreign ministry said Russia must strictly respect
the terms of its arms embargo exemption to keep the weapons out
of the wrong hands.
    
    'WE'RE NOT INTERESTED'
    During the Cold War, the Soviet Union forged close military
and diplomatic ties with many African countries. It was involved
in proxy wars in states such as Angola, Ethiopia and Mozambique
and helped independence movements fight Western colonial powers.
    Russia is now trying to revive some of the relationships
that lapsed after the Soviet Union's collapse. It joins a number
of countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates looking
to set up bases in Africa, mediate in diplomatic stand-offs and
strike business deals. [nL5N1UT0GU] [nL8N1MB0CN]
    China has long had a major economic presence in Africa but
it has shied away from any military involvement. It did go a
step further last year, however, opening its first military base
outside China in Djibouti. 
    Near the world's busiest shipping lanes, Djibouti is also
home to a large French base, the only U.S. base in Africa, an
Italian camp and Japan's only overseas base.
    Djibouti blocked Russian attempts to set up a base, however,
saying it wanted to avoid becoming the terrain for a proxy war.
Moscow is now planning to build a logistics centre at a port in
neighbouring Eritrea. [nR4N1VI01N]
    While France has a military bases outside Djibouti in former
colonies Gabon, Ivory Coast and Senegal and its soldiers also
operate in Chad, Mali and Niger, analysts say Washington's
influence is on the wane. 
    Its trade with the continent has halved in the past decade,
though much of that is due to U.S. shale replacing oil imports
from Africa. Diplomatic posts have gone unfilled and a task
force based in CAR tracking warlord Joseph Kony left last year.
    ""Our actions on the diplomatic and military side have sent a
huge signal to our partners that we're not interested in
Africa,"" said Donald Bolduc, who commanded U.S. special forces
across the continent until last year.
    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor
Nagy said Washington's commitment to Africa was unwavering but,
""there is space for other countries to play a positive role in
the region"".
    
    AFRICAN DEALS
    As part of Russia's renewed push, Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov went on a five-nation tour of Africa in March, attended a
summit in South Africa in June and visited Rwanda, chair of the
African Union, this year.
    Russia has also struck military cooperation deals with many
African countries since 2015, though some have yet to come into
force. The agreements typically involve providing weapons and
training in areas such as counter-terrorism and piracy.
[nL8N1WQ54N]
    Analysts caution that the deals often appear more symbolic
than transformative and say it's not clear if Russia has the
resources, or desire, to continue expanding its presence.
    But as in the Cold War, military deals can come alongside
economic links, such as mining and energy agreements. Ethiopia
signed its deal in April, a month after Lavrov visited to
discuss nuclear energy, agriculture and transportation projects.
    Russian firms have signed mineral deals in Sudan, which
cooperates with Moscow in defence technology, and Russia is
looking at diamond and platinum projects in Zimbabwe as well as
energy projects in Chad. [nL5N1QQ30K]
    Over the past decade, Russian trade with sub-Saharan Africa
has increased fast, albeit from a low base. From 2010-2017,
total trade rose to $4.2 billion a year from $1.6 billion,
according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies https://www.csis.org.
 
    During the same period, China's total trade with sub-Saharan
Africa nearly doubled to $165 billion while U.S. trade more than
halved to $37 billion.
    
    WAGNER GROUP
    Since arriving in CAR, the Russians' remit has expanded
beyond military advice and into various economic and diplomatic
activities, a Western diplomat and security source said,
fuelling the beginnings of a Western backlash.
    In August, France, the United Kingdom and the United States
blocked a Russian request to send more weapons. The U.S. mission
to the United Nations said in a note to the sanctions committee
that it was awaiting, ""confirmation that measures had been taken
to ensure the secure management of the previous donation"".
    Estimates of the number of Russians in CAR vary widely, from
250 to 1,000. Touadera's spokesman declined to provide details,
nor say what activities the Russians were engaged in. 
    Yevgeny Shabayev, head of a chapter of a paramilitary
Cossack organisation who has ties to Russian security
contractors, said there could be 1,000 in CAR and 5,000 to
10,000 across Africa, including in Sudan, South Sudan and Libya.
    One Russian private military contractor, the Wagner group,
was thrust into the spotlight in July when three Russian
journalists were killed in CAR while investigating its alleged
presence there. [nL5N1UR790]
    Reuters has been unable to confirm whether Wagner
contractors are in CAR. People with ties to the group have told
Reuters it has carried out clandestine combat missions on the
Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine and Syria.
    Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their
orders. They have denied any role in the journalists' deaths. 
    Russia has also stepped into negotiations with militias in
CAR, adding to Western misgivings about its presence.
    According to a U.N. panel of experts, Touadera's Russian
adviser has met militia leaders several times to discuss
disarmament and the distribution of natural resources revenue.
    Russia said in August after brokering talks between armed
groups that Touadera had expressed gratitude for its involvement
and that it intended to continue its mediation.
    Reuters was unable to contact the adviser, Zakharov, for
comment. 
    ""There is a real division between that guy and the rest of
the presidential advisers,"" the security source said. ""When you
ask, 'Can we see your colleague?' they say, 'Who, our colleague?
We don't know him'.""

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: TECH SHINES AS EUROPEAN STOCKS CLIMB, FRESENIUS MEDI SINKS (0715 GMT)
    European stocks are definitely feeling that boost from Wall St this morning, with benchmarks
up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across the board. Tech is driving the gains, the best-performing sector
<.SX8P> with a 2.5-percent gain after chipmaker ASML reported strong results. 
    ASML is jumping 6.6 percent, the top STOXX gainer, and driving peers AMS, STMicro, and
Infineon up with it. 
    Fresenius Medical Care is the standout faller, down 13 percent with its parent group
Fresenius also down 8.9 percent after the medical group cut its 2018 sales and income outlook
due to underperformance of its U.S. business in Q3. 
    British publishing group Pearson, a widely shorted stock with many ""sell"" ratings, is rising
4.5 percent after it reiterated its outlook for 2018, saying it was on track to return to profit
growth. [nL8N1WX14L]
    Most pre-market indications had it down 1 to 2 percent or up just 1 percent - with just one
trading desk calling the shares up 5 to 7 percent - so this strong move is likely to have
flummoxed a few. Of course the stock has a big short base, so any positive news makes big waves.

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    By Prak Chan Thul
    PHNOM PENH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A European Union decision to
ramp up trade pressure on Cambodia has alarmed unions in its
garment industry, a pillar of the economy that employs about
700,000 people, but a key grouping of manufacturers said the
risk would take months to materialise.
    Cambodia's biggest export market, the EU, warned this month
that the Southeast Asian nation would lose special access to the
world's largest trading bloc, in a punitive response to its move
away from democracy. [nL8N1WL2JW]
    Some Western countries have criticised a July election won
by Prime Minister Hun Sen, calling it flawed, because of a
campaign of intimidation by his allies, and the lack of a
credible opposition dissolved by the Supreme Court.
    The repercussions could devastate garment exports that
account for about 40 percent of Cambodia's gross domestic
product (GDP), and industries such as sugar.
    ""The European market is an important one,"" said At Thon, the
president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers'
Democratic Union.
    ""If factories close their doors, it will be hard."" 
    Cambodia's factories supply global brands, such as Gap Inc
<GPS.N>, Swedish fashion brand H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB
<HMb.ST>, and sportswear brands Nike <NKE.N>, Puma and Adidas
<ADSGn.DE>, among others.
    Cambodia's exports to the European Union, under its
""Everything but Arms"" (EBA) scheme, were worth 5 billion euros
($5.8 billion) last year, EU data show.
    Although Hun Sen vowed to defend Cambodia's sovereignty in
the wake of the EU announcement, some union leaders fear workers
already grappling with personal debt could see bank balances
plunge further into the red. [nL4N1WO0LP] 
    ""Workers borrow some money to build houses for their parents
or do other businesses,"" Sia Kunthea, president of the Cambodia
Women Labor Union Federation, told Reuters. 
    The European Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia is seriously
concerned about the possibility of trade preferences being
withdrawn, it told the European Commission this week.
    ""We would suggest a different course of action to foster the
EU's core values, through cooperation activities rather than by
implementing a suspension or sanctions,"" the body representing
the private sector, said in a letter.
    
    PRODUCERS OPTIMISTIC
    Cambodia's $7-billion apparel industry is the largest formal
employer among a population of 15 million.
    ""It will be difficult if the EBA is suspended,"" said Hoeun
Tharith, 42, a shoe factory worker and father of three, adding
that he shrank from the consequences of losing his monthly
income of about $210.    
    Yet the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia
(GMAC), which represents 600 factories, is optimistic.
    The threat of tariffs was still months away and would be the
subject of a six-month EU review, said Kaing Monika, the
grouping's deputy secretary general. 
    ""At this point, nobody can guarantee what the outcome will
be and whether it will result in a substantial loss,"" Kaing
Monika told Reuters. 
    ""What we are more concerned about is the media speculation
leading to reduced confidence from buyers and investors ... the
actual situation might be much less frightening.""
    Some say it is too soon to tell if buyers will pull out and
turn to lower-cost Asian rivals.
    Sweden's H&M, which sources from 62 factories in Cambodia,
said it understood the need to look into the rights situation,
but urged the European Union to also weigh the impact on
workers.
    ""Potential negative effects on the employment for the people
in the garment industry must be taken into consideration,"" it
said in a statement to Reuters, without saying if it planned to
pull out of Cambodia.
    Costs are lower in neighbouring Vietnam, another
garment-making hub, where the minimum wage ranges from $118 to
$170. 
    This advantage will only improve after a hike of seven
percent takes effect in Cambodia's textiles and footwear
industry in January, pushing the corresponding figure to $182.
    ""Of course if companies move Vietnam might benefit a little
bit,"" Dang Phuong Dung, a former official of the Vietnam Textile
and Apparel Association, told Reuters.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
firmly tell Theresa May it is up to her to sort out divisions in
her own government over Brexit when she addresses them before
their summit dinner in Brussels tonight. Officials said they
expect the leaders to tell May they have little more to offer
since talks stalled on Sunday and they will step up preparations
for Britain to drop out of the EU with no deal. That being said,
media reports suggest EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said he
is ready to offer Britain a one-year extension of the transition
period due to end in December 2020 if it helps seal a
post-Brexit trade deal between the two sides. That of course
does not address the current sticking point of talks - the Irish
border wrangle - but will be held up by the EU side as proof of
its flexibility. Trade Minister Liam Fox also argues a longer
transition period will be required, The Times reports this
morning. 
    The EU's efforts to get a new all-encompassing treaty on its
ties with Switzerland look to be heading for failure, meanwhile.
Negotiations have in many ways mirrored those with the UK - in
Switzerland's case, labour rules protecting its high-wage model
from outside competition have rubbed up against the bloc's
internal market rules, notably on the free movement of people. 
Four years of negotiations have failed to produce a breakthrough
by the EU's mid-October deadline, with yesterday's talks also
ending in stalemate. A final failure to strike a deal would mean
no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes
for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered
EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical
devices, if pacts on mutual recognition of standards lapse.
Throughout the talks the EU has insisted on a strict
interpretation of its rules, aware that any concessions it makes
to Switzerland could weaken its position in the separate Brexit
negotiations.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
Earnings to the rescue. World stock markets have staged a
powerful rally over the past 24 hours, offsetting the gloom of
the past week as the first sweep of third-quarter U.S. earnings
eases concerns about any imminent slowdown in punchy U.S. profit
growth, still running at annual clip in excess of 25 percent.
Not only have the major banks such as JPMorgan, Citi, Bank of
America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley come in ahead of
forecasts, but Netflix stock surged more than 10 percent after
the bell on Tuesday as it reported subscriber growth well ahead
of expectations during the quarter. Leading the rest of the
so-called FANG internet stocks higher – Facebook, Amazon and
Google-parent Alphabet – the Netflix update helps soothe nerves
that the leading tech sector was about to roll over. Despite
trade war jitters, U.S. industrial production grew faster than
expected last month – countering the soundings from an
underwhelming retail sales report earlier in the week. U.S.
Treasury yields, which raced to seven-year peaks last week, have
also remained calm this week. They hovered close to 3.16 percent
again overnight despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest
broadside against the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. 
    The positive earnings and economics twist, helped by some
calming of relations between Western countries and Saudi Arabia
over how Riyadh plans to handle the disappearance of dissident
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate, saw all
three U.S. equity benchmarks jump more than 2 percent on
Tuesday. The VIX volatility gauge plunged below 20 percent to as
low as 17.5, almost half the peaks of last Thursday. MSCI’s
all-country index of world stocks rose 1.7 percent on Tuesday,
its biggest one-day gain since June 2016, and extended that move
this morning. It’s now re-captured about a quarter of the points
loss it suffered over the past month. The return to risk lifted
Asia bourses too, with Tokyo and Seoul gaining more than 1
percent but Shanghai underperforming with a more modest 0.6
percent rise as the U.S. Treasury report on currency
manipulation around the world is still awaited. The overall mood
shift has also helped emerging-market currencies regain some
lost ground against the dollar. A monthly survey of fund
managers conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed
investors viewing emerging-market currencies as being at their
most undervalued in the history of the poll. Although the dollar
was firmer first thing on Wednesday, some of the worst-hit
emerging-market currencies – such as Argentina’s peso, Turkey’s
lira, Brazil’s real, India’s rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah – all
regained some lost ground over the past day or so.
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set to help lift
European shares further from the 22-month low hit last week with
futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set of
corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML
and drug giant Roche. Overall, European third-quarter earnings
are expected to rise 13.6 percent, down from the 14 percent
growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES.

bounce on Wednesday led by technology shares, as upbeat earning
updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML came to the
rescue following a turbulent start to the month.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> benchmark index rose 0.5
percent to a one-week high, having hit a 22-month low last week
when jitters over rising U.S. bond yields and geopolitical
worries rattled global markets. 
    The rebound was broad-based with all major European indexes
and most sectors trading in positive territory.
    ASML <ASML.AS> shares rose 10 percent after the Dutch
equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted a
stronger-than-expected rise in third-quarter earnings that
should ease worries over a slowdown in the semiconductor market.
[nL8N1WX0PC] 
    The company said demand for memory and logic chips remains
healthy and it expects further growth in 2019. That helped lift
shares in other tech companies and sent their sectoral index
<.SX8P> rising 2.5 percent.
    Among top gainers following results were also UK publisher
Pearson <PSON.L> and paints maker Akzo Nobel <AKZO.AS>, both up
more than 4 percent, while drug maker giant Roche <ROG.S> rose
0.5 percent after a modest sales beat in the third quarter. 
    Fresenius Medical Care <FMEG.DE> however sank 15 percent
after the German dialysis specialist cut its 2018 sales and
profit targets following a poor performance of its US business.

 (Adds detail, fresh comments)
    By Alastair Macdonald and Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
give British Prime Minister Theresa May a tough reception in
Brussels on Wednesday, warning her to rally support at home for
the Brexit deal on offer or be cut loose without one in March.
    May will address the other 27 EU national leaders at a
summit before they dine without her. Officials said they
expected the leaders to tell May they have little more to offer
since talks stalled on Sunday and will step up preparations for
Britain to drop out of the bloc with no deal.     
    Summit chair Donald Tusk said the risk of a ""no deal"" taking
Britain out of the bloc and into legal limbo and border chaos on
March 29 was greater than ever. [nL8N1WW542]
    He put the onus on May to bring a ""creative"" solution to
break the impasse over the EU-UK land border on the island of
Ireland. [nL8N1WV44K] 
    The ""no deal"" message is sincere enough. It is also a tactic
to pressure a negotiating partner the EU views as weak. And it
might help May by giving her the kind of political theatre
useful in persuading Britons she has fought for the best deal.
    More subtly, leaders may also sound relaxed on the calendar
for talks. On Tuesday, officials echoed the mantra that ""the
clock is ticking"" to agree a treaty that parliaments can ratify
in time for Brexit. But, sensing more urgency in London, senior
EU officials said Brussels would ""keep calm and carry on"".
    The bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told ministers
from the remaining 27 member states on Tuesday that December was
""the ultimate deadline"" for a deal with London to give both the
European and UK parliaments time for ratification.
    EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday are not expected
to firmly commit to an extra Brexit summit in November, which
they had earlier pencilled in case of an October breakthrough.
[nS8N1RN018]
    
    UNCOMPROMISING TONE
    But a summit next month could be called at short notice if
there is solid progress in negotiations between Brussels and
London, diplomats and officials said, which the bloc does not
expect before May gets her budget adopted in early November.
    ""If we have a deal on the withdrawal agreement, it will be
November... or early December,"" Philippe Lamberts, an EU
lawmaker dealing with Brexit said on Wednesday. ""I do not expect
the transition to end at the end of 2020.""
    ""The transition period postpones the moment when the
backstop will kick in.""
    After an intense week of talks, London on Sunday walked away
from a deal in which the EU offered to extend the post-Brexit
transition by a year until the end of 2021 in a way to make the
emergency fix for the Irish border more palatable to Britain. 
    This ""two-tier backstop"" would keep Britain in the EU's
single market and customs union for longer, giving sides more
time to work out a new trade deal that would maintain an open
Irish border from then on. 
    The EU insists on guarantees that extensive border checks
would not return on the island of Ireland regardless of how
Brexit goes, something London is finding difficult to accept as
it would include some trade barriers emerging inside the UK.
    Germany's Europe minister called on May to ""take
responsibility and be constructive"". 
    Tusk said EU leaders would need to believe that a deal is
nearly done to hold a Brexit summit in November. 
    ""There needs to be a much clearer, sharper messaging on the
choice the UK faces,"" one senior diplomat told fellow national
envoys after talks broke down on Sunday. The EU had gone as far
as it could to address May's difficulties with her hardline
pro-Brexit and Northern Irish allies, he said.
    Quite how tough the EU message is to May after Wednesday's
dinner will depend on her approach, diplomats said. If she
brings to Brussels the uncompromising tone they heard a month
ago in Salzburg, then the EU warnings of impending calamity will
step up.
    EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker will tell leaders
after May has spoken on Wednesday about his European
Commission's plans for a ""no deal"". Officials say that will
include how to rush through emergency EU legislation to cope
with huge disruption to transport and trade links.

    MACRONOMICS: THE CLOCK IS TICKING...(1005 GMT) 
    With Brexit, Merkel's coalition under threat and budget angst in Italy and Spain, French
politics are not exactly at the centre of attention.
    The reshuffling of Macron's government (read all about it here: [nL8N1WW1SA]) isn't exactly
front page news outside of France but investors who have made a bet on the ability of the
40-years-old president to turn around the French economy might be a tad concerned. 
    ""We still believe the Macron team will be able to push through some additional reform, but
clearly less than markets hoped for at the start of his mandate"", ING economists write, warning
that ""the clock is ticking"" to get the job done. 
    ""The economic outlook is likely to be less supportive for reforms in the second half of
2019"", they argue with a forecast of GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2018, 1.7 percent in 2019 and
a deceleration in 2020.
    ""This leaves the new team less than one year to gain ground on major reforms"", ING believes.
    On the bright side, investors who put their money in the French economy can't complain so
far. Paris' CAC 40 has outperformed peers since Macron won the first round of the presidential
election in April 2017. (It's the orange line below)

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: TECH SHINES AS EUROPEAN STOCKS CLIMB, FRESENIUS MEDI SINKS (0715 GMT)
    European stocks are definitely feeling that boost from Wall St this morning, with benchmarks
up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across the board. Tech is driving the gains, the best-performing sector
<.SX8P> with a 2.5-percent gain after chipmaker ASML reported strong results. 
    ASML is jumping 6.6 percent, the top STOXX gainer, and driving peers AMS, STMicro, and
Infineon up with it. 
    Fresenius Medical Care is the standout faller, down 13 percent with its parent group
Fresenius also down 8.9 percent after the medical group cut its 2018 sales and income outlook
due to underperformance of its U.S. business in Q3. 
    British publishing group Pearson, a widely shorted stock with many ""sell"" ratings, is rising
4.5 percent after it reiterated its outlook for 2018, saying it was on track to return to profit
growth. [nL8N1WX14L]
    Most pre-market indications had it down 1 to 2 percent or up just 1 percent - with just one
trading desk calling the shares up 5 to 7 percent - so this strong move is likely to have
flummoxed a few. Of course the stock has a big short base, so any positive news makes big waves.

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

    EUROPEAN EARNINGS? STEERING THROUGH THE PERILS (1042 GMT)
    Blockbuster U.S. earnings have clearly helped markets forget for a bit that mix of worries
that upset markets this month. In Europe however the picture looks more mixed and even though
quarterly earnings growth is comfortably in double-digit territory, there's no shortage of
warnings and estimate downgrades are piling up. 
    European shares started the day with a solid rebound but the good mood rapidly deteriorated,
highlighting how strong results from tech bellwether ASML were not enough of a boost to sustain
the bounce. Bad earnings news came from Fresenius Medical Care as well as a warning from Goldman
Sachs that this season could be a challenging one for European autos. [nL8N1WX1J3][nL8N1WX2RP]
    Overall it seems that investors are looking more to steer through the season avoiding big
damages, rather than waiting to party over big earnings beats. Worries about Europe's
export-oriented economy and fractious politics linger in the background.
    Here are a couple of views we gathered:
    * ""We still have a lot of uncertainty... We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last
couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer
through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift"" - Baader Bank
strategist Gerhard Schwarz. 
    * ""It will be difficult to navigate this tricky season, with some slowdown expected in
industrials, auto, semi and China-related areas of the market. However, low valuations and the
recent fall in prices suggest that if we navigate this season without too much damage, then we
can be constructive and look for buying opportunities"" - Kairos Partners portfolio
manager Federico Trabucco.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

    EUROPEAN EARNINGS? STEERING THROUGH THE PERILS (1042 GMT)
    Blockbuster U.S. earnings have clearly helped markets forget for a bit that mix of worries
that upset markets this month. In Europe however the picture looks more mixed and even though
quarterly earnings growth is comfortably in double-digit territory, there's no shortage of
warnings and estimate downgrades are piling up. 
    European shares started the day with a solid rebound but the good mood rapidly deteriorated,
highlighting how strong results from tech bellwether ASML were not enough of a boost to sustain
the bounce. Bad earnings news came from Fresenius Medical Care as well as a warning from Goldman
Sachs that this season could be a challenging one for European autos. [nL8N1WX1J3][nL8N1WX2RP]
    Overall it seems that investors are looking more to steer through the season avoiding big
damages, rather than waiting to party over big earnings beats. Worries about Europe's
export-oriented economy and fractious politics linger in the background.
    Here are a couple of views we gathered:
    * ""We still have a lot of uncertainty... We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last
couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer
through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift"" - Baader Bank
strategist Gerhard Schwarz. 
    * ""It will be difficult to navigate this tricky season, with some slowdown expected in
industrials, auto, semi and China-related areas of the market. However, low valuations and the
recent fall in prices suggest that if we navigate this season without too much damage, then we
can be constructive and look for buying opportunities"" - Kairos Partners portfolio
manager Federico Trabucco.

    MACRONOMICS: THE CLOCK IS TICKING...(1005 GMT) 
    With Brexit, Merkel's coalition under threat and budget angst in Italy and Spain, French
politics are not exactly at the centre of attention.
    The reshuffling of Macron's government (read all about it here: [nL8N1WW1SA]) isn't exactly
front page news outside of France but investors who have made a bet on the ability of the
40-years-old president to turn around the French economy might be a tad concerned. 
    ""We still believe the Macron team will be able to push through some additional reform, but
clearly less than markets hoped for at the start of his mandate"", ING economists write, warning
that ""the clock is ticking"" to get the job done. 
    ""The economic outlook is likely to be less supportive for reforms in the second half of
2019"", they argue with a forecast of GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2018, 1.7 percent in 2019 and
a deceleration in 2020.
    ""This leaves the new team less than one year to gain ground on major reforms"", ING believes.
    On the bright side, investors who put their money in the French economy can't complain so
far. Paris' CAC 40 has outperformed peers since Macron won the first round of the presidential
election in April 2017. (It's the orange line below)

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: TECH SHINES AS EUROPEAN STOCKS CLIMB, FRESENIUS MEDI SINKS (0715 GMT)
    European stocks are definitely feeling that boost from Wall St this morning, with benchmarks
up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across the board. Tech is driving the gains, the best-performing sector
<.SX8P> with a 2.5-percent gain after chipmaker ASML reported strong results. 
    ASML is jumping 6.6 percent, the top STOXX gainer, and driving peers AMS, STMicro, and
Infineon up with it. 
    Fresenius Medical Care is the standout faller, down 13 percent with its parent group
Fresenius also down 8.9 percent after the medical group cut its 2018 sales and income outlook
due to underperformance of its U.S. business in Q3. 
    British publishing group Pearson, a widely shorted stock with many ""sell"" ratings, is rising
4.5 percent after it reiterated its outlook for 2018, saying it was on track to return to profit
growth. [nL8N1WX14L]
    Most pre-market indications had it down 1 to 2 percent or up just 1 percent - with just one
trading desk calling the shares up 5 to 7 percent - so this strong move is likely to have
flummoxed a few. Of course the stock has a big short base, so any positive news makes big waves.

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    AN INCONVENIENT TREND FOR THE Q3 EARNINGS SEASON (1048 GMT) 
    Unlike Al Gore's 2006 movie, it won't cause the end of the world as we know it but still,
there seems to be a most inconvenient trend building up for Europe's Q3 season.
    According to Refinitiv data, the earnings growth estimate trend has gone down from a little
less than 15 percent in August to 13.6 on Oct. 16. 
    This comes as European stocks are at their cheapest since the euro zone crisis and can't
really afford to disappoint market expectations if they want to catch up with their buoyant
American peers.

products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German Justice Minister Katarina
Barley will be the Social Democrats' (SPD) top candidate in
European elections next year, the party said on Wednesday,
announcing a move that heralds a change to Chancellor Angela
Merkel's divided cabinet.
    Barley is expected to give up her current position in
conservative Merkel's ruling coalition to lead the SPD's
campaign in Germany for the election due in May.
    With conservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer under
pressure to resign following his party's disastrous performance
in a regional election in Bavaria on Sunday, Merkel may yet need
to reshuffle her cabinet in the coming weeks. [nL8N1WW56N]
    Divisions within her cabinet widened in the run-up to the
Bavaria election. 
    Since the vote, the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister
party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CSU), has vowed to
make the coalition work. CSU leader Seehofer had been Merkel's
leading critic in the ruling alliance before the election
    Barley said she wanted to help the SPD, junior partner in
Merkel's ruling alliance, after the party suffered a battering
in the Bavaria election, at which it won less than 10 percent of
the vote. ""I want to make my contribution to things improving,""
she told reporters.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles added of Barley: ""She is a born
European, with British father, a German mother, dual
nationality, her two sons have grand parents from four European
countries. She speaks four European languages fluently.""

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone countries must each
ensure their budgets are stable and economies competitive,
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ahead of a European Union
summit on Wednesday, as Italy weighs expansionary budget plans
that risk EU rejection.
    Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, has prepared
an expansionary 2019 budget that sets up a showdown with
authorities in Brussels over compliance with EU rules. The
European Commission may reject the plans. [nL8N1WV1L6]
[nR1N1RB02K] [nR1N1VZ02C]
    Merkel told the Bundestag lower house of parliament in
Berlin that all members of the euro zone were responsible for 
their own economic and budget policy.
    ""Each state in the euro zone is obliged to take care of
stability and to take necessary reforms for its competitiveness
- and that applies now in good economic times,"" she added.
    ""At the same time, as we have learned from painful
experience, in a currency union we are so closely intertwined
with one another that national policies can always have effects
on the other member states.""
    She said stable budgets were an important condition for good
economic development in each individual country, adding: ""Solid
public finances are also a condition for trust in the currency
union."" 
    ""Our guide remains the Stability and Growth Pact. I will
continue to make the case that in Europe this principle applies:
responsibility and solidarity, liability and control - those are
two sides of the same coin,"" she added to laud applause.

    IT'S LIKE 2017 NEVER HAPPENED! (1221 GMT)
    Remember last year's #Euroboom? 
    It's now fading into a distant memory as the STOXX index, European earnings expectations,
and even investor allocations have fallen back to their 2016 levels. 
    BAML's fund manager survey shows investors' allocations to euro zone equities are back to
the level they were in December 2016 as the market has unwound all last year's positivity around
the region.
    Meanwhile, UK equities are coming back into favour. Allocations are now at 19% underweight,
the survey found, from last month's 24% underweight - and BAML strategists reckon that's on
""hopes of a Brexit deal being concluded shortly and the UK's high exposure to commodities
sectors"". 
    Allocations to the UK are now their highest since July this year - with the UK joining EM as
the only regions seeing improvements in positioning. Allocations remain significantly below
their long-term average, though - so there could be much further to go.

    AN INCONVENIENT TREND FOR THE Q3 EARNINGS SEASON (1048 GMT) 
    Unlike Al Gore's 2006 movie, it won't cause the end of the world as we know it but still,
there seems to be a most inconvenient trend building up for Europe's Q3 season.
    According to Refinitiv data, the earnings growth estimate trend has gone down from a little
less than 15 percent in August to 13.6 on Oct. 16. 
    This comes as European stocks are at their cheapest since the euro zone crisis and can't
really afford to disappoint market expectations if they want to catch up with their buoyant
American peers.

    EUROPEAN EARNINGS? STEERING THROUGH THE PERILS (1042 GMT)
    Blockbuster U.S. earnings have clearly helped markets forget for a bit that mix of worries
that upset markets this month. In Europe however the picture looks more mixed and even though
quarterly earnings growth is comfortably in double-digit territory, there's no shortage of
warnings and estimate downgrades are piling up. 
    European shares started the day with a solid rebound but the good mood rapidly deteriorated,
highlighting how strong results from tech bellwether ASML were not enough of a boost to sustain
the bounce. Bad earnings news came from Fresenius Medical Care as well as a warning from Goldman
Sachs that this season could be a challenging one for European autos. [nL8N1WX1J3][nL8N1WX2RP]
    Overall it seems that investors are looking more to steer through the season avoiding big
damages, rather than waiting to party over big earnings beats. Worries about Europe's
export-oriented economy and fractious politics linger in the background.
    Here are a couple of views we gathered:
    * ""We still have a lot of uncertainty... We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last
couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer
through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift"" - Baader Bank
strategist Gerhard Schwarz.

    MACRONOMICS: THE CLOCK IS TICKING...(1005 GMT) 
    With Brexit, Merkel's coalition under threat and budget angst in Italy and Spain, French
politics are not exactly at the centre of attention.
    The reshuffling of Macron's government (read all about it here: [nL8N1WW1SA]) isn't exactly
front page news outside of France but investors who have made a bet on the ability of the
40-years-old president to turn around the French economy might be a tad concerned. 
    ""We still believe the Macron team will be able to push through some additional reform, but
clearly less than markets hoped for at the start of his mandate"", ING economists write, warning
that ""the clock is ticking"" to get the job done. 
    ""The economic outlook is likely to be less supportive for reforms in the second half of
2019"", they argue with a forecast of GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2018, 1.7 percent in 2019 and
a deceleration in 2020.
    ""This leaves the new team less than one year to gain ground on major reforms"", ING believes.
    On the bright side, investors who put their money in the French economy can't complain so
far. Paris' CAC 40 has outperformed peers since Macron won the first round of the presidential
election in April 2017. (It's the orange line below)

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: TECH SHINES AS EUROPEAN STOCKS CLIMB, FRESENIUS MEDI SINKS (0715 GMT)
    European stocks are definitely feeling that boost from Wall St this morning, with benchmarks
up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across the board. Tech is driving the gains, the best-performing sector
<.SX8P> with a 2.5-percent gain after chipmaker ASML reported strong results. 
    ASML is jumping 6.6 percent, the top STOXX gainer, and driving peers AMS, STMicro, and
Infineon up with it. 
    Fresenius Medical Care is the standout faller, down 13 percent with its parent group
Fresenius also down 8.9 percent after the medical group cut its 2018 sales and income outlook
due to underperformance of its U.S. business in Q3. 
    British publishing group Pearson, a widely shorted stock with many ""sell"" ratings, is rising
4.5 percent after it reiterated its outlook for 2018, saying it was on track to return to profit
growth. [nL8N1WX14L]
    Most pre-market indications had it down 1 to 2 percent or up just 1 percent - with just one
trading desk calling the shares up 5 to 7 percent - so this strong move is likely to have
flummoxed a few. Of course the stock has a big short base, so any positive news makes big waves.

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

    HELSINKI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Finland's government survived a
confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday called over its plan
to boost employment by weakening workers' protection against
dismissal.
    A total of 101 members of parliament voted in favour of the
centre-right coalition, while 73 were against after the
government called the vote to seek support across party lines
for the proposals that have angered unions.
    ""We got clear support for the (government's) employment
policy,"" Prime Minister Juha Sipila told reporters at parliament
after the vote.
    Labour unions said they would continue to protest against
the plan however, and at least 10,000 employees in the welfare
and public sector are expected to go on a two-day strike next
Monday.
    While the government has argued the reform is necessary to
curb Finland's rate of unemployment, currently at 6.8 percent,
the unions have been particularly angered by a measure that
would make it easier for small companies to dismiss workers.

    EUROTRASH: WHAT IF IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EARNINGS? (1244 GMT) 
    There's quite a lot of research today arguing that Q3 is really a make or break moment for
European shares on course for their worst year since 2011. 
    In this context, Barclays strategists make an interesting point by noting that profits and
sales are in no way the main driver of European shares' underperformance so far this year. 
    ""For once earnings cannot be blamed for the poor returns year-to-date,"" they say, pointing
out that results have held up, ""contrasting with the typical downtrend observed in previous
years"".
    Earnings are well above their historic average and would normally be more consistent with
rising stock markets.  
    The good news is that valuations, being so low, provide a support.
    ""The recent correction combined with the compression in P/E multiples could provide some
cushion to share prices if earnings disappoint, while the beats could lead to stronger share
price reaction than usual,"" Barclays' Emmanuel Cau and team note.
    Here's their chart showing how earnings expectations don't fit the usual trend of a bearish
market:

    IT'S LIKE 2017 NEVER HAPPENED! (1221 GMT)
    Remember last year's #Euroboom? 
    It's now fading into a distant memory as the STOXX index, European earnings expectations,
and even investor allocations have fallen back to their 2016 levels. 
    BAML's fund manager survey shows investors' allocations to euro zone equities are back to
the level they were in December 2016 as the market has unwound all last year's positivity around
the region.
    Meanwhile, UK equities are coming back into favour. Allocations are now at 19% underweight,
the survey found, from last month's 24% underweight - and BAML strategists reckon that's on
""hopes of a Brexit deal being concluded shortly and the UK's high exposure to commodities
sectors"". 
    Allocations to the UK are now their highest since July this year - with the UK joining EM as
the only regions seeing improvements in positioning. Allocations remain significantly below
their long-term average, though - so there could be much further to go.

    AN INCONVENIENT TREND FOR THE Q3 EARNINGS SEASON (1048 GMT) 
    Unlike Al Gore's 2006 movie, it won't cause the end of the world as we know it but still,
there seems to be a most inconvenient trend building up for Europe's Q3 season.
    According to Refinitiv data, the earnings growth estimate trend has gone down from a little
less than 15 percent in August to 13.6 on Oct. 16. 
    This comes as European stocks are at their cheapest since the euro zone crisis and can't
really afford to disappoint market expectations if they want to catch up with their buoyant
American peers.

    EUROPEAN EARNINGS? STEERING THROUGH THE PERILS (1042 GMT)
    Blockbuster U.S. earnings have clearly helped markets forget for a bit that mix of worries
that upset markets this month. In Europe however the picture looks more mixed and even though
quarterly earnings growth is comfortably in double-digit territory, there's no shortage of
warnings and estimate downgrades are piling up. 
    European shares started the day with a solid rebound but the good mood rapidly deteriorated,
highlighting how strong results from tech bellwether ASML were not enough of a boost to sustain
the bounce. Bad earnings news came from Fresenius Medical Care as well as a warning from Goldman
Sachs that this season could be a challenging one for European autos. [nL8N1WX1J3][nL8N1WX2RP]
    Overall it seems that investors are looking more to steer through the season avoiding big
damages, rather than waiting to party over big earnings beats. Worries about Europe's
export-oriented economy and fractious politics linger in the background.
    Here are a couple of views we gathered:
    * ""We still have a lot of uncertainty... We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last
couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer
through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift"" - Baader Bank
strategist Gerhard Schwarz. 
    * ""It will be difficult to navigate this tricky season, with some slowdown expected in
industrials, auto, semi and China-related areas of the market. However, low valuations and the
recent fall in prices suggest that if we navigate this season without too much damage, then we
can be constructive and look for buying opportunities"" - Kairos Partners portfolio
manager Federico Trabucco.

submitted for approval on Wednesday a free trade agreement with
Vietnam, its first comprehensive open markets deals with a
developing Asian country.
    The EU-Vietnam trade and investment agreements will need
approval from the EU's 28 members and from the European
Parliament, some of whose members have expressed concern over
Vietnam's human rights record.
    The parties have agreed a related accord to promote
democracy and human rights, including commitments, dialogue and
possible sanctions. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said
no one denied there were human rights problems in Vietnam.
    ""We are talking openly about this with our Vietnamese
counterparts and the trade agreement will not make Vietnam a
fully fledged democracy overnight. It is one tool in the toolbox
that we have in relations with Vietnam and other countries,"" she
told a news conference.
    The European Union will sign a trade deal on Friday with
Singapore, another member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), and is in talks with Indonesia.
    It is unclear whether the European Parliament, which is
expected to debate and vote on the Singapore agreement as well
as the EU-Japan free trade deal, will have time to pass the
Vietnam accord before EU elections in May.   
    The trade deal would eliminate 99 percent of all tariffs,
although some staged over a time period and some, notably
agricultural products, limited by quotas.
    Vietnam, for example, would cut its duty on EU car imports
from 78 percent to zero over 10 years and for wines and spirits,
from around 50 percent, over seven years. EU companies would
also be able to bid for Vietnamese public contracts.
    In return, the European Union would take seven years to
eliminate its duties on certain Vietnamese products, such as its
major textiles, clothing and footwear exports.
    Vietnam has pledged to protect 169 European food and drinks
products, such as champagne or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese,
meaning such names could only be used for EU imports.
    The agreement includes a chapter on sustainable development,
such as implementing international standards on labour rights
and the Paris climate accord.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Slovenia should press ahead
with privatisations to improve its competitiveness and reform
its pension system over the medium-term, a senior official at
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said
on Tuesday.
    ""Privatisation is really important for overall productivity
in the economy and raising the level of competitiveness,""
Charlotte Ruhe, EBRD Managing Director for Central and South
Eastern Europe, said in an interview during a visit to
Ljubljana.
    She welcomed the fact that the new centre-left government,
which took power in September, has already started privatising
state-owned banks Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Abanka, adding she
expected further sell-offs in the coming years.
    Ruhe, after holding meetings with government officials, said
the government was likely to sell some tourism firms and could
start privatisation of the largest telecoms operator, Telekom
Slovenia <TLSG.LJ>, in the second half of 2019. 
    Slovenia's privatisation coordinator Slovenian Sovereign
Holding (SDH) said on Wednesday the decision on whether Telekom
would be sold had not been made yet.
    ""At present, SDH is not leading activities connected to the
sale of Telekom Slovenia as a decision on the possible start of
the sales process has not been made yet,"" it said in a statement
prepared for Reuters.
    ""SDH ... is preparing an annual plan of managing state
assets for 2019 which will have to be approved by the
government,"" it added, saying the plan would also include the
management plan for Telekom Slovenia among other firms.
    Ruhe also said the government would have to reform the
pension system to ease the burden of a rapidly ageing population
on the state budget, giving no further details.
    Earlier on Tuesday the government's macroeconomic institute
UMAR said Slovenia should increase productivity in order to be
able to meet public sector unions' demands for higher wages.

    * Little sign of Brexit breakthrough
    * EU leaders to step up 'no deal' plans
    * Irish border remains main obstacle

    By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will address European Union counterparts in Brussels on
Wednesday but there is little hope on either side of a quick
breakthrough after Brexit talks stalled at the weekend.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed a hardening tone
among the 27 other governments, whose leaders will gather over
dinner after a presentation by May to discuss stepping up
preparations for Britain dropping out of the EU with no deal in
March.
    All member states, she said before flying to the summit,
must prepare for all outcomes: ""That includes the possibility
that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.""
    With wrangling over how to keep Northern Ireland's land
border with the EU open after Britain leaves the EU's customs
and regulatory space, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said
it was unlikely the 27 leaders would set a date for a special
summit to seal a deal - as was the hope before talks stalled.
    Summit chair Donald Tusk called on May to come to Brussels
with ""creative"" new ideas to unblock the process, but British
officials have given little indication she has much new to say
as she battles deep opposition among her own allies to the kind
of agreement which Brussels says is pretty much its final offer.
    May told parliament in London she wanted any treaty that
includes the Irish border issue linked to a separate declaration
the two sides intend to issue on their intentions for a close
EU-UK trade pact to be negotiated after Brexit.
    EU negotiators agree that a close customs and regulatory
relationship could avert the kind of border disruption that
could revive sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, but they
still want a ""backstop"" guarantee that if that is not in place,
then the EU would keep the province in a special economic zone.
    May and her Northern Irish allies reject that as posing a
risk of breaking up the United Kingdom. [nL8N1WV44K]
    
    TRANSITION EXTENSION
    EU diplomats told Reuters on Monday that EU negotiator
Michel Barnier offered to help defuse the issue by extending a
status-quo transition period for Britain by an extra year to the
end of 2021 to give time for a trade deal that would avert the
need to trigger a backstop for Northern Ireland. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, whose chamber
needs to see a treaty this year to have time to ratify it by
March, told reporters that he would support Barnier's proposal
to lengthen the transition period to three years from two.
    Many continental officials involved in the process have long
said a longer transition may be needed to conclude a free trade
deal anyway. However, May is also under pressure from Brexit
supporters to cut ties to the bloc as soon as possible.
    May is due to address her peers at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT). There
is unlikely to be much dialogue around the table, with EU
leaders insisting London negotiate exclusively through Barnier.
    The 27 will move to a dinner without May to hear reports
from Barnier and from European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker. He will brief them on how the EU executive is stepping
up planning and guidance for governments on what must be done to
cope with Britain leaving on March 29 with no treaty in place.
    Both sides are coming under pressure from business to reach
agreement soon to avoid firms running up needless costs.
    A joint pre-summit plea from the European auto and car parts
sector warned disruption to cross-Channel supply chains would be
""catastrophic"" and wipe out much of a quarter-century of
recovery in England's car industry. [nL8N1WX1VJ]
    May will rejoin her counterparts for a regular EU summit on
Thursday, to be followed in the evening and on Friday by a
summit with Asian leaders, including China's Premier Li Keqiang
and the prime ministers of Japan, South Korea and Russia.

output
    * Plant near Venice already recycling disposable diapers
    * Diapers, plastics major environmental problem
    * Global awareness leaps after Chinese ban on imports 

    By Stephen Jewkes and Martinne Geller
    MILAN/LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A joint venture between
Procter & Gamble <PG.N> and Italian healthcare group Angelini is
working to create a sustainable recycling loop that would allow
dirty diapers to be turned into plastic bottle caps and viscose
clothing. 
    More than 20 million tonnes of disposable diapers are burned
or dumped in landfills globally every year - a major
environmental problem since their use became widespread in the
1960s and 1970s.
    Part of the problem is that collecting, cleaning and
breaking diapers into their component parts - plastic, cellulose
and super absorbent polymer - is tricky and expensive. 
    The other issue is that no-one has been able to establish a
market for the recycled output, dooming previous commercial
efforts to failure.
    Fater, a Pescara, Italy-based business that became a joint
venture in 1992, believes it will be able to address these
issues, backed by governments, consumers and other companies
goaded into action by a new global awareness of the looming
crisis of plastics pollution.
    The new Italian government, in particular, has made finding
""circular economy"" solutions a pillar of its populist agenda.   
    ""Nappies are made of the highest quality plastics and we've
shown they can be recycled to extract high-value building
blocks,"" says Marcello Somma, Fater's director of research and
development and business development.
    For P&G, the world's leading diaper maker and one of the
biggest contributors to the problem with nearly 27 percent of
the $44 billion diaper market, Fater ticks several boxes.
    P&G aims to be able to recycle absorbent hygiene products
(AHP), as diapers, incontinence pads and feminine hygiene
products are known, in 10 cities by 2030, according to its
latest sustainability agenda. In the long term, it hopes to use
100 percent renewable or recycled materials for all products and
packaging.
    Roberto Marinucci, P&G's vice president of global baby
wipes, sustainability and the joint venture, said the company
had still not established whether consumers would be willing to
pay a premium for diapers they know are going to be recycled,
but it was clear they want brands to care about the environment.
    ""We believe that the first reason, which is doing the right
thing for the consumer, is sufficient enough to convince us to
go ahead with the project,"" Marinucci said in an interview.
    Under EU regulations, Fater cannot sell the output of its
diaper recycling operation, located near Venice, until it proves
there is a market for it. To that end, it has been working on
prospective clients and now has 11 letters of intent with
businesses like bioplastic manufacturers and paper mills.
    P&G is also part of an EU-backed group of 13 companies
developing end products for the output. They include bioplastic
manufacturer, Novamont, which can use the cellulose to make
pharmaceutical ingredients. 
    Fater says the plastic from recycled diapers can be used to
make school desks and urban playgrounds, cellulose can become
viscose fabric or specialty paper, and super-absorbent polymer
can be used in gardening and flood barriers.
    P&G has no plans to use Fater's output in its diapers, which
include Pampers and Luvs, until it completes consumer research
on the idea, Marinucci said. In the interim, he said, the
company may use the plastics for bottle caps. 
    The biggest delay to the project has been regulatory,
Marinucci said, but he predicts it will get the EU green light
in the next 12 months.     
    In the meantime, after several years in development, Fater's
plant is operating at about a third of its 10,000-tonne annual
capacity to provide samples and build stockpiles.
    The plant expects to generate annual revenue equal to 50
percent of the cost of its machinery, Marinucci said. 
    ""We're working on well-grounded assumptions, but they're
still assumptions,"" he said. If it works, it could be expanded.
    
    CHINA STOPS WASTE IMPORTS
    Government efforts to resolve the problem of plastics
pollution gained urgency last year when China announced it would
stop importing foreign waste. China in 2016 took in 7.3 million
tonnes of waste plastics - 56 percent of world imports.    
    Fater is not the first to attempt diaper recycling. UK-based
Knowaste was forced to close its 70,000 tonne-per-year recycling
plant in Holland in 2007 after a new incinerator beat it on cost
and it was unable to find markets for the final product.
    Efforts to open another facility have failed so far but
Knowaste continues to invest in technology and is now
considering a plant in the Middle East.
    ""We were way ahead of the curve and maybe went too soon. But
the market is now showing clear signs of maturing,"" said company
CEO Roy Brown.
    Fater's patented process starts with local waste management
utility Contarina SpA, which collects used diapers and other AHP
from curbside bins or large users like hospitals from more than
50 local towns, trucking them in to the 1,000-sq metre plant.
    After dry cleaning the diapers using contact steam and
disposing of the human waste in waste water treatment plants,
one tonne of AHP waste can yield 150 kg of cellulose, 75 kg of
absorbing material and 75 kg of mixed plastic.
    Starting at the end of 2020, a small-scale biorefinery in
Amsterdam will be able to process the recovered secondary raw
materials and convert them into biologically-based products like
biodegradeable plastics and biofertilizers.
    Guy Schanschieff, founder of UK-based reusable diaper brand
Bambino Mio, says he has seen others try and fail to recycle
diapers over the years. For one thing, busy parents can't always
deposit diapers in the required bins, he said. 
    ""At the end of the day, it's a disposable product and it's
going to be thrown away,"" said Schanschieff, who is also
chairman of the Nappy Alliance trade group.
    ""Not creating the waste in the first place is always going
to be the best thing.""

in August, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on
Wednesday, reflecting a sharp fall in Turkish purchasing power
and domestic demand after the lira collapsed.
    Exports to Turkey were 27 percent lower than in August 2017,
falling to 1.3 billion euros ($1.50 billion).

Turkey released a U.S. pastor who has been at the centre of a

 (Updates with Der Spiegel article, adds comment)
    By Virginia Furness and Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A recovery in Italy's bond market
fizzled out on Wednesday, with yields rising once again - this
time on a report that the EU will say the draft Italian budget
does not meet the bloc's guidelines, news of fresh supply and a
selloff in risk assets.
    Having fallen in the past two sessions as well as opening
lower on Wednesday, Italian government bond yields were 3 to 8
basis points higher across the curve.
    European Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said Italy's draft
budget for 2019 was not in line with European Union guidelines,
according to German magazine Der Spiegel, reviving concerns
about a clash between the EU and Rome over the Italian
government's expansionary fiscal plans.
    ""The story has ignited some fear back into the market,"" said
Jean-Christophe Marchado, a fixed income strategist at Natixis.
    Earlier in the day, Italy announced a bond buyback, combined
with a reopening of several long-dated bonds in a bond exchange
deal due later this week. [nL8N1WX3BR]
    While buybacks tend to boost the Italian market, the
announcement that this will take place with a tap of existing
bonds put upward pressure on long-dated yields.
    The selloff in long-dated debt extended to shorter-dated
maturities after the Der Spiegel report and as stock markets
globally sold off, denting appetite for risk assets in general.
    Italy's 10-year government bond yield was up 8 bps at 3.54
percent, pushing the gap over German Bund yields back above 300
basis points. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10IT10YT=RR>.
    Two-year Italian bond yields were 3.5 bps higher at 1.63
percent <IT2YT=RR>, having given up earlier falls.
    Rome officially approved an expansionary budget on Monday,
but markets were relieved that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
remained in office, prompting a recovery in Italian bonds.
[nL8N1WW5I0]
    Next year's projected deficit of 2.4 percent of output is
well below the EU's 3 percent ceiling - a policy to discourage
member states from going down a path of unsustainable spending -
but it is up sharply from a targeted 1.8 percent this year.
    This contravenes EU regulations that call on Italy and other
highly indebted countries to steadily narrow the shortfall
towards zero. 
    Last week, many appeared to be positioning for worse news on
the budget front, with data suggesting investors were going
heavily short on Italian debt, said UniCredit rates strategist
Luca Cazzulani. 
    Thomson Reuters data shows that open interest in short-dated
BTP futures was at its highest in over a year on Oct. 11, and
remained elevated for the rest of the week. <FBTSc1> 
    ""The fact that you had such high open interest at a time of
dropping bond prices suggests that a lot of shorts were coming
into the market,"" said Cazzulani. ""With the absence of any
negative news this week, some of that will come out."" 
    As risk aversion returned to financial markets, yields on
safe-haven German 10-year bonds fell to a two-week low of 0.45
percent <DE10YT=RR>.
    Two-year German yields hit a six-week low of minus 0.6160
percent <DE2YT=RR>, pushing the gap over U.S. peers <US2YT=RR>
to its widest in 30 years.

    BAD NEWS: YOUR UK STOCK IS DOWN; GOOD NEWS: NICE YIELD!(1520 GMT) 
    There's been an handsome rise in dividend yields within the FTSE 100 companies but it's not
entirely due to their generosity or their underlying wealth. 
    ""A combination of share price falls and growing dividend forecasts is pushing up the
dividend yield on offer from some of the UK’s largest companies,"" AJ Bell’s latest Dividend
Dashboard report shows. 
    To be fair, the FTSE may well be down over 8 percent since the beginning of the year, but
payments to shareholders are also rising quickly. 
    AJ Bell expects a record payment of nearly 90 billion pounds, up about 10 percent, amounting
to average yield of 4.3 percent.

    EUROTRASH: WHAT IF IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EARNINGS? (1244 GMT) 
    There's quite a lot of research today arguing that Q3 is really a make or break moment for
European shares on course for their worst year since 2011. 
    In this context, Barclays strategists make an interesting point by noting that profits and
sales are in no way the main driver of European shares' underperformance so far this year. 
    ""For once earnings cannot be blamed for the poor returns year-to-date,"" they say, pointing
out that results have held up, ""contrasting with the typical downtrend observed in previous
years"".
    Earnings are well above their historic average and would normally be more consistent with
rising stock markets.  
    The good news is that valuations, being so low, provide a support.
    ""The recent correction combined with the compression in P/E multiples could provide some
cushion to share prices if earnings disappoint, while the beats could lead to stronger share
price reaction than usual,"" Barclays' Emmanuel Cau and team note.
    Here's their chart showing how earnings expectations don't fit the usual trend of a bearish
market:

    IT'S LIKE 2017 NEVER HAPPENED! (1221 GMT)
    Remember last year's #Euroboom? 
    It's now fading into a distant memory as the STOXX index, European earnings expectations,
and even investor allocations have fallen back to their 2016 levels. 
    BAML's fund manager survey shows investors' allocations to euro zone equities are back to
the level they were in December 2016 as the market has unwound all last year's positivity around
the region.
    Meanwhile, UK equities are coming back into favour. Allocations are now at 19% underweight,
the survey found, from last month's 24% underweight - and BAML strategists reckon that's on
""hopes of a Brexit deal being concluded shortly and the UK's high exposure to commodities
sectors"". 
    Allocations to the UK are now their highest since July this year - with the UK joining EM as
the only regions seeing improvements in positioning. Allocations remain significantly below
their long-term average, though - so there could be much further to go.

    AN INCONVENIENT TREND FOR THE Q3 EARNINGS SEASON (1048 GMT) 
    Unlike Al Gore's 2006 movie, it won't cause the end of the world as we know it but still,
there seems to be a most inconvenient trend building up for Europe's Q3 season.
    According to Refinitiv data, the earnings growth estimate trend has gone down from a little
less than 15 percent in August to 13.6 on Oct. 16. 
    This comes as European stocks are at their cheapest since the euro zone crisis and can't
really afford to disappoint market expectations if they want to catch up with their buoyant
American peers.

    EUROPEAN EARNINGS? STEERING THROUGH THE PERILS (1042 GMT)
    Blockbuster U.S. earnings have clearly helped markets forget for a bit that mix of worries
that upset markets this month. In Europe however the picture looks more mixed and even though
quarterly earnings growth is comfortably in double-digit territory, there's no shortage of
warnings and estimate downgrades are piling up. 
    European shares started the day with a solid rebound but the good mood rapidly deteriorated,
highlighting how strong results from tech bellwether ASML were not enough of a boost to sustain
the bounce. Bad earnings news came from Fresenius Medical Care as well as a warning from Goldman
Sachs that this season could be a challenging one for European autos. [nL8N1WX1J3][nL8N1WX2RP]
    Overall it seems that investors are looking more to steer through the season avoiding big
damages, rather than waiting to party over big earnings beats. Worries about Europe's
export-oriented economy and fractious politics linger in the background.
    Here are a couple of views we gathered:
    * ""We still have a lot of uncertainty... We have seen a lot of profit warnings over the last
couple of weeks but also some companies that stick to their guidance. If we manage to steer
through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift"" - Baader Bank
strategist Gerhard Schwarz. 
    * ""It will be difficult to navigate this tricky season, with some slowdown expected in
industrials, auto, semi and China-related areas of the market. However, low valuations and the
recent fall in prices suggest that if we navigate this season without too much damage, then we
can be constructive and look for buying opportunities"" - Kairos Partners portfolio
manager Federico Trabucco.

    MACRONOMICS: THE CLOCK IS TICKING...(1005 GMT) 
    With Brexit, Merkel's coalition under threat and budget angst in Italy and Spain, French
politics are not exactly at the centre of attention.
    The reshuffling of Macron's government (read all about it here: [nL8N1WW1SA]) isn't exactly
front page news outside of France but investors who have made a bet on the ability of the
40-years-old president to turn around the French economy might be a tad concerned. 
    ""We still believe the Macron team will be able to push through some additional reform, but
clearly less than markets hoped for at the start of his mandate"", ING economists write, warning
that ""the clock is ticking"" to get the job done. 
    ""The economic outlook is likely to be less supportive for reforms in the second half of
2019"", they argue with a forecast of GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2018, 1.7 percent in 2019 and
a deceleration in 2020.
    ""This leaves the new team less than one year to gain ground on major reforms"", ING believes.
    On the bright side, investors who put their money in the French economy can't complain so
far. Paris' CAC 40 has outperformed peers since Macron won the first round of the presidential
election in April 2017. (It's the orange line below)

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: TECH SHINES AS EUROPEAN STOCKS CLIMB, FRESENIUS MEDI SINKS (0715 GMT)
    European stocks are definitely feeling that boost from Wall St this morning, with benchmarks
up 0.4 to 0.8 percent across the board. Tech is driving the gains, the best-performing sector
<.SX8P> with a 2.5-percent gain after chipmaker ASML reported strong results. 
    ASML is jumping 6.6 percent, the top STOXX gainer, and driving peers AMS, STMicro, and
Infineon up with it. 
    Fresenius Medical Care is the standout faller, down 13 percent with its parent group
Fresenius also down 8.9 percent after the medical group cut its 2018 sales and income outlook
due to underperformance of its U.S. business in Q3. 
    British publishing group Pearson, a widely shorted stock with many ""sell"" ratings, is rising
4.5 percent after it reiterated its outlook for 2018, saying it was on track to return to profit
growth. [nL8N1WX14L]
    Most pre-market indications had it down 1 to 2 percent or up just 1 percent - with just one
trading desk calling the shares up 5 to 7 percent - so this strong move is likely to have
flummoxed a few. Of course the stock has a big short base, so any positive news makes big waves.

    ON OUR RADAR: ASML, ROCHE, AND OTHER UPDATES (0656 GMT)
    The earnings-driven Wall Street bounce is set help lift European shares farther away from
the 22-month low hit last week with futures up 0.4 percent, as investors digest Europe's own set
of corporate updates including from semiconductor bellwether ASML and drug giant Roche.
    The Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted quarterly net profit slightly
ahead of expectations and said it expects to grow more in 2019 as demand for memory and logic
chips remains healthy. That has lifted its shares up 1-5 percent in pre-market and could ease
some concern over a slowdown in the semiconductor cycle. 
    Roche's third-quarter sales also rose more than expected as revenue from new drugs offset
the impact rivals' copies are having on the Swiss group's top-selling medicines. Roche shares
are up around 2 percent pre-market.
    On a more downbeat note, Fresenius Medical cut its 2018 targets, while yoghurt maker Danone
saw sales growth slowing sharply in the third quarter on falling sales of its infant formula
products in China. Danone however kept its 2018 goals. Results at Pearson, which said it was on
track to return to profit growth this year, look okay but not great, a trader says.
    Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down
from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES. Euro zone earnings
growth forecasts have also fallen to 11.7 percent from 12 percent, while US earnings growth
forecast has been nudged up 21.8 percent from 21.6 percent.

expectations, while Fresenius Medical <FMEG.DE> has cut its 2018 targets and Danone <DANO.PA>

    MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN REBOUND TO CONTINUE (0520 GMT)
    European shares are expected to extend their bounce today as upbeat earnings from the likes
of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson and Netflix helped Wall Street end near the
session highs, helping investors leave behind worries over slowing growth, politics and surging
U.S. Treasury yields. 
    ""This strong (Wall Street) finish looks set to spill over into a positive European open this
morning with most eyes on today's European Council meeting and the latest inflation numbers from
the UK and EU, not to mention the latest Fed minutes,"" notes Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC
Markets in London.
    Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 27 points higher at 7,087, Frankfurt's
DAX to open 48 points higher at 11,825 and Paris' CAC to open 14 points higher at 5,187.
    Asian equities also rode the Wall Street bounce overnight with the relief over corporate
results and data helping restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies.
Chinese blue chips, however, lagged and threatened to sour the mood. [nL3N1WX1J6]

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Moscow-October 17: Fitch Ratings has downgraded Telia Company AB's 
(Telia) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'A-' following the 
completion of the acquisition of TDC A/S's (TDC) Norwegian business, Get AS. 

The downgrade reflects Fitch's expectations that Telia's funds from operations 
(FFO) adjusted net leverage is likely to increase to 3.0x at end-2018 and 
continue to rise in 2019-2020 following the acquisition of Norwegian cable 
operator Get, a shareholder-friendly dividend policy and a three-year share 
repurchase programme. The increase takes Telia's leverage above Fitch's 
downgrade threshold of 2.5x for an 'A-' rating.

Telia's recently announced agreement to buy Swedish media company Bonnier 
Broadcasting (Bonnier), if successful, is likely to put pressure on the 'BBB+' 
rating asleverage may rise above the new downgrade threshold of 3.5x in 
2020-2021. At this stage we do not include the deal into our calculations. Telia 
retains significant financial flexibility due to strong free cashflow (FCF) 
generation, capex reductions and potentially a more prudent shareholders 
remuneration policy.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Leverage to Increase: Fitch expects Telia's FFO adjusted net leverage to 
increase to 3.0x at end-2018 from 1.7x at end-2017. The main drivers behind the 
leverage increase are Telia's NOK21 billion acquisition of TDC's Norwegian 
assets and a share repurchase programme, which implies a spending of SEK5 
billion per year over 2018-2020. We forecast leverage to be at 3.1x-3.4x in 
2019-2021 if the company does not undertake more MAs.

Get Strengthens Position in Norway: The Get deal strengthens Telia's market 
position in Norway by allowing the company to provide converged services and 
compete more efficiently against the incumbent operator Telenor, the market 
leader in both fixed and mobile segments. The telecom market in Norway is 
mature, saturated and competitive, which leaves little opportunities for organic 
growth. The acquisition of Get enables Telia to provide fixed voice and 
broadband, pay TV and, most importantly, converged services. Telia can also 
strengthen its position in the enterprise segment as the deal is complementary 
to its acquisition of the B2B operator Phonero completed in 2017.

Synergies and Integration Costs: Telia estimates the Get deal to generate 
synergies of NOK0.6 billion on a run-rate basis by 2021, driven by cross-selling 
between the various services and cost efficiencies. Integration should take two 
years at an estimated cost of NOK200 million in 2019 and 2020.

Bonnier Acquisition Adds Leverage Pressure: The Bonnier acquisition will likely 
put pressure on Telia's balance sheet in the medium-term to the extent that 
leverage may rise above the new downgrade threshold of 3.5x on a FFO adjusted 
net basis in 2020-2021 if the deal is completed in 2H19 as expected. Although 
the purchase of a TV broadcaster may be complementary to Telia's convergence 
strategy in the long-term, we see material execution and integration risks in 
the short term while synergies will take several years to materialise in full. 
Telia signed an agreement to acquire Bonnier in July 2018 for SEK9.2 billion on 
a cash and debt-free basis. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. 

We expect the Bonnier deal to breach the top border of the company's leverage 
target range of 1.5x-2.5x net debt/EBITDA while the existing dividend policy and 
share repurchase programme may not allow Telia to reduce leverage swiftly. This 
targeted range roughly corresponds to Fitch's FFO adjusted net leverage metric 
of between 2.5x and 3.5x. Hence if the deal is completed and the company does 
not take any measures to improve its leverage Telia's ratings are likely to be 
under pressure.

Cost-cutting to Support Margins: Telia targets net cost savings of SEK1.1 
billion in 2018, of which SEK0.7 billion were achieved in 1H18. The programme 
was adopted in mid-2017 and the company was able to reverse the negative trend 
in organic EBITDA in 2H17. Some distortion of margins is possible on the back of 
continuing MA activity and associated integration costs, which may temporarily 
pressure on margins before synergies kick in.

Shift in Focus: Telia continues to implement its strategic move to focus on 
Nordic and Baltic countries while gradually reducing its exposure to emerging 
markets. In 2017, the company fully sold its 25% share in Megafon, reduced its 
stake in Turkcell and in 2018 sold its economic interests in Geocell and 
Azercell. Lower diversification for Telia is compensated by a decreased exposure 
to regulatory and macroeconomic risks typically associated with emerging 
markets. MAs within the existing footprint of Telia may strengthen its market 
positions, widen its product range and support its convergence strategy.

Strong Positions in Core Markets: Telia maintains strong competitive positions 
in its core markets in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, which together 
accounted for more than 90% of the company's EBITDA in 2017 (excluding 
discontinued operations). These are mature markets with keen competition in both 
the mobile and fixed segments. The high level of mobile data consumption is one 
of the key supportive factors for these core markets.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

The ratings of Telia are underpinned by its leading market position it both the 
mobile and fixed line segments in Sweden and Finland, as well as by adequate 
diversification with a strong presence in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Telia 
is smaller and less geographically diversified than its peer group such as 
Deutsche Telekom AG (BBB+/Stable), Telefonica S.A. (BBB/Stable) and Vodafone 
Group Plc (BBB+/Stable). However, excluding its discontinued operations, it 
operates mainly in developed European markets with minimal macroeconomic and 
regulatory risks. The company's ratings benefit from robust pre-dividend free 
cash flow (FCF) generation, strong financial flexibility and moderate leverage.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer

- Broadly stable revenue (excluding discontinued operations) between 2018 and 
2021

- Modest EBITDA margin improvements to 32.8% by 2021, driven by cost reductions

- Capex at 18%-19% of revenue between 2018 and 2021

- 2018 dividend in line with company guidance, then increasing by 2% annually 
thereafter

- No associate dividends from Turkcell in 2019-2021

- Share buybacks of SEK5 billion annually between 2018 and 2020

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

-  FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably below 2.5x

-  Sustainable competitive position in core markets

Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

- Expectations of FFO adjusted net leverage trending above 3.5x, which could 
lead to a downgrade

-  A substantial increase in competition in Telia's main Nordic markets

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

Adequate Liquidity: Telia demonstrates adequate liquidity with SEK46 billion of 
cash and cash equivalents as of December 2017, a SEK14.7 billion undrawn 
committed revolving credit facility, forecast positive pre-dividend FCF and an 
established track record of accessing debt markets. This compares well with an 
even debt maturity profile.

 (Adds May, other comments)
    By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May said she believed a Brexit deal was still possible as she
arrived in Brussels on Wednesday to meet her European Union
counterparts, three days after talks stalled over how to manage
the Irish border.
    But fellow EU leaders sounded impatient, signalling that
they were ready to listen to May but also preparing to discuss 
plans for Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a
deal.
    In pointed remarks, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite
told reporters that the essence of the problem lay in May's
inability to rally her feuding party around a workable set of
negotiating demands. There was still time for a deal, she said,
but there would be no breakthrough yet.
    May did not answer a question about whether she had brought
the ""creative"" new proposal that summit chair Donald Tusk has
asked for, instead sticking to a rehearsed line that a deal
could be done and that it was in the EU's interest to reach one.
    ""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in
the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the
Northern Irish backstop,"" she told reporters on arrival.
    ""By working intensively and closely, we can achieve that
deal,"" May added. ""Now is the time to make it happen.""
    Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed the tougher
tone coming from the 27 other governments, whose leaders will
gather over dinner after a presentation by May at 7 p.m. (1700
GMT).
    All member states, she said before flying to the summit,
must prepare for all outcomes: ""That includes the possibility
that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.""
    With wrangling over how to keep Northern Ireland's land
border with the EU open after Britain leaves the EU's customs
and regulatory space, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said
it was unlikely the 27 leaders would set a date for a special
summit to seal a deal - as was the hope before talks stalled.
    Tusk had called on May to come to Brussels with new ideas to
unblock the process, but British officials have given little
indication that she has much new to say as she battles deep
opposition among her own allies to the kind of agreement which
Brussels says is pretty much its final offer.
    May earlier told parliament in London she wanted any treaty
that includes the Irish border issue linked to a separate
declaration the two sides intend to issue on their intentions
for a close EU-UK trade pact to be negotiated after Brexit.
    EU negotiators agree that a close customs and regulatory
relationship could avert the kind of border disruption that risk
reviving sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, but they still
want a ""backstop"" guarantee that if that is not in place, then
the EU would keep the province in a special economic zone.
    May and her Northern Irish allies reject that as posing a
risk of breaking up the United Kingdom. [nL8N1WV44K]
    
    TRANSITION EXTENSION
    EU diplomats told Reuters on Monday that EU negotiator
Michel Barnier offered to help defuse the issue by extending a
status-quo transition period for Britain by an extra year to the
end of 2021 to give time for a trade deal that would avert the
need to trigger a backstop for Northern Ireland. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, whose chamber
needs to see a treaty this year to have time to ratify it by
March, told reporters that he would support Barnier's proposal
to lengthen the transition period to three years from two.
    Many continental officials involved in the process have said
a longer transition may be needed to conclude a free trade deal
anyway. However, May is also under pressure from Brexit
supporters to cut ties to the bloc as soon as possible.
    There is unlikely to be much dialogue around the table when
May addresses other leaders on Wednesday. They have insisted
that London negotiate exclusively through Barnier.
    The 27 will then dine without May and hear reports from
Barnier and from European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker. He will brief them on how the EU executive is stepping
up planning and guidance for governments on what must be done to
cope with Britain leaving on March 29 with no treaty in place.
    Both sides are coming under pressure from business to reach
agreement soon to avoid firms running up needless costs.
    A joint pre-summit plea from the European auto and car parts
sector warned disruption to cross-Channel supply chains would be
""catastrophic"" and wipe out much of a quarter-century of
recovery in England's car industry. [nL8N1WX1VJ]
    May will rejoin her EU counterparts on Thursday as the focus
shifts to a summit with Asian leaders, including China's Premier
Li Keqiang and the prime ministers of Japan, South Korea and
Russia.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders are
meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss Brexit after London
walked away last week from a deal the EU has offered over
disagreements on how to keep an open Irish border [nL8N1WX526].
    Below please find comments by EU leaders upon arriving at
the summit.
    
    MICHEL BARNIER, EU BREXIT NEGOTIATOR
    ""We have worked a lot for the past few weeks and days, and
nights also, with the British delegations to reach a global
agreement for the withdrawal agreement and the political
declaration.""
    ""We are not there yet.""
    ""Brexit must be orderly for everyone and for all issues,
including the island of Ireland.""
    ""We need time, we need much more time. We will continue the
work in the next weeks calmly and patiently.""
        
    MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, PRIME MINISTER OF POLAND
    ""We are having an impasse situation.""
    ""There is a large risk that there can be no agreement. It's
mostly over Northern Ireland and the border with Republic of
Ireland."" 
    ""For us it is most important how our citizens in the UK will
be treated, and our entrepreneurs.""
    
    EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT 
    ""I have a message of both confidence and urgency. Progress
has been made and we can see there is a common willingness to
move forward, but we're not there yet and we need to decide
now."" 
    ""It is urgent to find deals to get a withdrawal agreement.""
    ""British Prime Minister Theresa May must tell us what she
can possibly accept considering the (UK domestic) political
balance.""
    ""We now have to find a solution and an agreement.""
    ""We made a lot of progress but now it is time to find a good
agreement.""
    ""We are not so far but now it's time to find this final
agreement.""
        
    GIUSEPPE CONTE, PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY
    ""(Italy is) available to keep window open on Brexit talks
and to conclude negotiations. But it seems a bit complicated.""
    
    ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR
    ""We want good relations with Britain. We would have been
happy if the exit deal was ready. Instead, we are 90 percent
there. But I will tackle the issues in good spirit and try
everything to find an agreement. That would be the best solution
for both sides.""
    
    LEO VARADKAR, PRIME MINISTER OF IRELAND
    ""A longer transition period... I've always been of the view
that it could easily take two years or more to negotiate a new
EU-UK treaty covering everything from economy to trade to
security.""
    ""That can easily take more than two years and would have to
be ratified by 28 parliaments. So there is merit in discussing
the idea of a longer transition. But that can't be an
alternative to the backstop on Ireland. Certainly not.""
    ""It would have to be 'as well as'. But if did it help to
reassure people that the backstop would never be activated, that
would be a positive thing.""
    
    MARK RUTTE, DUTCH PRIME MINISTER
    ""I do think a lot of progress has been made.""
    ""The debate is now concentrating on this issue of the Irish
border and how to prevent a border on the Irish sea, which is 
something the UK desperately wants to avoid.""
    ""At the same time we all want to avoid a hard border on the
island of Ireland.""
    ""I don't think we will solve this issue completely but I am
cautiously optimistic that over coming weeks Michel Barnier and
the negotiating team in the UK will come to final conclusions.""
    
    PETER PELLEGRINI, PRIME MINISTER OF SLOVAKIA
    ""I'm a very optimistic person but not today.""
    ""I think we will receive ... information that there is still
no deal and I think we should do the maximum until the last day
to try to have an agreement.""
    ""But on the other side the other 27 countries, we should be
prepared also for a no-deal result. And I think maybe it will
finish like that.""
    ""My hope was that today we'll have already some concrete
solution on the table, but it looks like it will not be a deal
today."" 
    
    THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
    ""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in
the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the
Northern Irish backstop ... By working intensively and closely,
we can achieve that deal. As I say a deal is in the interests
not just of the UK but also the European Union.""  
    ""Now is the time to make it happen."" 
    
    DALIA GRYBAUSKAITE, PRESIDENT OF LITHUANIA
    ""Today there will be no breakthrough.""
    ""We realise that the technical agreement of last week was
not accepted in London.""
    ""It will be November and maybe even more summits because we
are not yet in the final stage (of negotiations).""
    
    XAVIER BETTEL, PRIME MINISTER OF LUXEMBOURG
    ""We just need to finalise something because the 29th of
March will be the last day of the UK in our family. So we need
to find an agreement. And we still need to work also on
no-deal.""
    ""I am able to come back as often as we need to come if it's
to find a solution. But I don't want just to come to have a cup
of coffee ... We all have to move together.""
    ""We fully understand that Prime Minister May has a difficult
situation in the UK ... We have to move on both sides.""
    ""There is still hope (for a Brexit agreement). But there is
also the possibility of a no-deal. We'll continue to work on a
no-deal too. Even if we have an agreement here it doesn't mean
that Westminster agrees.""
    ""We won't block a longer transition if it's to find a common
solution.""
    ""A divorce is not always good... But the fact is we need to
find an agreement.""
     ""We have a common market and we can't change rules for the
UK.""
    ""I won't be the one who will block a discussion about having
maybe a year more for the backstop.""
    Q: How seriously do you take the prospect of a no deal?
    A: ""Very seriously.""
    ""We can't wait for long to have a solution. We need to hurry
up, they leave in six months.""
    
    JURI RATAS, PRIME MINISTER OF ESTONIA
    ""I regret that we don't have an agreement yet between the UK
and the EU. But I still believe that this agreement is possible
and our goal is to find the solution and to find the way. I
think it's possible.""
    ""It's very important to keep the 27 close. We are united, we
are acting as a team and we understand very well that the main
question is the border question between Northern Ireland and
Ireland.
    ""The UK was and is a close and important partner for us.""

 (Adds Macron, Barnier comments)
    By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May said she believed a Brexit deal was still possible as she
arrived in Brussels on Wednesday to meet her European Union
counterparts, three days after talks stalled over how to manage
the Irish border.
    But fellow EU leaders sounded impatient, signalling that
they were ready to listen to May but also preparing to discuss 
plans for Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a
deal.
    Many suggested the core problem was May's inability to rally
her feuding party around a workable set of negotiating demands.
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said weeks of work were
needed to crack the problem, promising to approach the talks
""calmly and patiently"".
    French President Emmanuel Macron said May could help by
explaining what her precarious domestic situation would allow
her to accept: ""Theresa May must tell us what she can possibly
accept considering the political balance,"" he told reporters.
    Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the ball was in
Britain's court but cautioned against predicting doom.
    ""It is always the case in negotiations that they are tense
and difficult and challenging at the end. That doesn't mean they
will fail. No one wants these negotiations to fail, neither the
EU nor Theresa May want a hard Brexit,"" Kurz said.
    May did not answer a question about whether she had brought
the ""creative"" new proposal that summit chair Donald Tusk has
asked for, instead sticking to a rehearsed line that a deal
could be done and that it was in the EU's interest to reach one.
    ""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in
the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the
Northern Irish backstop,"" she told reporters on arrival.
    ""By working intensively and closely, we can achieve that
deal,"" May added. ""Now is the time to make it happen.""
    Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed the tougher
tone coming from the 27 other governments, whose leaders will
gather over dinner after a presentation by May. 
    All member states, she said before flying to the summit,
must prepare for all outcomes: ""That includes the possibility
that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.""
    With wrangling over how to keep Northern Ireland's land
border with the EU open after Britain leaves the EU's customs
and regulatory space, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said
it was unlikely the 27 leaders would set a date for a special
summit to seal a deal - as was the hope before talks stalled.
    Tusk had called on May to come to Brussels with new ideas to
unblock the process, but British officials have given little
indication that she has much new to say as she battles deep
opposition among her own allies to the kind of agreement which
Brussels says is pretty much its final offer.
    May earlier told parliament in London she wanted any treaty
that includes the Irish border issue linked to a separate
declaration the two sides intend to issue on their intentions
for a close EU-UK trade pact to be negotiated after Brexit.
    EU negotiators agree that a close customs and regulatory
relationship could avert the kind of border disruption that risk
reviving sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, but they still
want a ""backstop"" guarantee that if that is not in place, then
the EU would keep the province in a special economic zone.
    May and her Northern Irish allies reject that as posing a
risk of breaking up the United Kingdom. [nL8N1WV44K]
    
    TRANSITION EXTENSION
    EU diplomats told Reuters on Monday that Barnier offered to
help defuse the issue by extending a status-quo transition
period for Britain by an extra year to the end of 2021 to give
time for a trade deal that would avert the need to trigger a
backstop for Northern Ireland. [nL8N1WV2RY]
    Asked about that, several leaders said that extending the
transition, during which Britain will be bound by EU rules but
have no say in them, would not be a big problem for them.
    Many continental officials involved in the process have said
a longer transition may be needed to conclude a free trade deal
anyway. However, May is also under pressure from Brexit
supporters to cut ties to the bloc as soon as possible.
    There is unlikely to be much dialogue around the table when
May addresses other leaders on Wednesday. They have insisted
that London negotiate exclusively through Barnier.
    The 27 will then dine without May and hear reports from
Barnier and from European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker. He will brief them on how the EU executive is stepping
up planning and guidance for governments on what must be done to
cope with Britain leaving on March 29 with no treaty in place.
    Both sides are coming under pressure from business to reach
agreement soon to avoid firms running up needless costs.
    A joint pre-summit plea from the European auto and car parts
sector warned disruption to cross-Channel supply chains would be
""catastrophic"" and wipe out much of a quarter-century of
recovery in England's car industry. [nL8N1WX1VJ]
    May will rejoin her EU counterparts on Thursday as the focus
shifts to a summit with Asian leaders, including China's Premier
Li Keqiang and the prime ministers of Japan, South Korea and
Russia.

    NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - When Peggy and Marco
Lachmann-Anke learned in January that hackers cracked a
40-character password and cleaned out their cryptocurrency
wallet, they did not go to the police or alert the tokens'
issuer, the Berlin-based technology group IOTA.
    They bought more coins.
    The Cyprus-based German couple, who describe themselves as
financial educators, figured they had no chance of recovering
the coins and it was not even clear who might take up their
case. Yet they took the roughly $14,000 loss in stride -
something that comes with the territory when one bets on a new,
exciting technology in a yet unregulated market.
    ""We really believe in cryptocurrencies. We have studied this
for about a year before investing, so we are aware of the
risks,"" Peggy Lachmann-Anke said. ""There was nothing we could
do."" 
    Far from unusual, the episode is emblematic for a market
where few rules apply and where investors' faith in the
blockchain technology goes hand in hand with the belief that it
also helps criminals cover their tracks so well that trying to
catch them is a fool's errand.
    Patrick Wyman, FBI supervisory special agent at the
financial crimes section of the agency's anti-money laundering
unit acknowledges cryptocurrencies pose some unique challenges.
    ""A decentralized currency system like bitcoin, or another
form of virtual currency is not governed by any entity,
suspicious reporting activity, and any anti-money laundering
compliance,"" Wyman told Reuters.     
    Various estimates show cryptocurrency crime is on the rise,
keeping pace with the market's rapid growth. That forces
investigators to focus on high-profile cases, security
professionals and officials say, effectively leaving small
investors to their own devices.
    ""We do not pretend that every law enforcement agency is
devoting resources to every single crime. That would not be
possible,"" said Jaroslav Jakubcek, an analyst at Europol, which
serves as a center for the European Union's law enforcement
cooperation, expertise and intelligence.
    
    UNREPORTED CASES
    Officials still encourage people to report cryptocurrency
theft to local police like any other crime, saying failing to do
so only emboldens criminals.
    Yet because many victims simply do not see the point,
cryptocurrency theft is far more common than any published
estimates suggest, security professionals say.
    According to financial research firm Autonomous NEXT and
Crypto Aware, which works with investors affected by crypto
scams, about 15 percent of cryptocurrencies have been stolen
between 2012 and the first half of 2018, representing a
cumulative $1.7 billion in value at the time of the theft and
with a rising tendency. In the first half of this year alone,
more than $800 million has already been stolen, according to the
data. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Nq3ngy)
   Yet Lex Sokolin, a partner and global director of fintech
strategy at the firm, estimates that as much as 85 percent of
crimes go unreported and says the published statistics only
represent publicly reported heists.
    Reuters interviews with half a dozen victims paint a similar
picture. Out of that group only two reported their losses to the
authorities and one soured on cryptocurrency investments.
    Armin Fischer, a Vienna-based IT specialist said he lost
about $5,300 in ether coins in a phishing scam in the summer of
2017 and immediately alerted the local police just to find out
that the duty officer had no idea what he was talking about.
     He said it took many months of knocking on doors to get his
case ultimately taken up by Vienna prosecutors' office, but it
is still pending. Fisher says by now he has had enough.
    ""I have seen firsthand how big the security leaks are.""
    Others are more philosophical.
    Dave Appleton, a blockchain developer for HelloGold, a gold
trading app company in Kuala Lumpur, said he lost about $3,000
of ether coins when scammed by a fake site touting a startup's
token pre-sale. He said he just moved on, glad he did not lose
more.
    ""The point is there's no one to report the crime to,""
Appleton said. ""I am not sure what country or jurisdiction it
would come under.""    
    According ICO tracker Coinschedule a record $21.3 billion
flowed into new tokens so far this year as investors keep
snapping up ""initial coin offerings,"" undeterred by high-profile
heists, bitcoin's and other currencies' slide from late 2017
peaks, and government warnings of widespread fraud and theft.
    
    MILLIONS AT STAKE
    David Jevans, chief executive of cybersecurity firm
CipherTrace in Menlo Park, California, estimates that even when
exchanges or trading platforms get hacked, perhaps only a fifth
of stolen coins is recovered because of the ease with which
digital tokens can move across several borders. [nL2N1SU2GP] 
    ""You have to get law enforcement in five countries
interested enough, have time enough, and have evidence enough to
open a case,"" he said. ""By the time they agree, get the
information, do all the paperwork, the money has been moved.""
    Security experts say in most cases millions need to be at
stake to justify such an effort. 
    U.S. entrepreneur and long-time cryptocurrency investor
Michael Terpin, who says he got robbed twice, learned firsthand
that not all hacks are created equal.
    He said first time when criminals accessed his cellphone
with stolen SIM card credentials, emptied a wallet connected to
it, and tricked his friends into sending money by impersonating
him on Skype, he contacted a friend at the FBI.
    But once she learned that only $60,000 got stolen, she
advised him to file a report via the FBI's internet crime center
website. Terpin said he did, but never heard back.
    Then, when last January he lost almost $24 million in tokens
from his mobile account, he went straight after the service
provider AT&T, filing a $224 million lawsuit accusing it of
negligence that allowed ""digital identity theft,"" a claim AT&T
denies. [nL1N1V51U5] 
    Undeterred, Terpin says he remains committed to blockchain
comparing it to the early days of Amazon.com Inc when the online
retailer faced much skepticism and even derision.
    ""That's similar to today's narrative that all ICOs (initial
coin offerings) are scams and nothing will ever be developed of
value because they're not already fully deployed,"" he said.
    Steadfast commitment to the new technology and belief that
it gives sophisticated criminals the upper hand mean that even
some multimillion heists go unreported.
    For example, when hackers stole about $9 million worth of
ether tokens from a Zug, Switzerland-based company Swarm City in
July 2017, the peer-to-peer digital platform did not report the
theft to the police, business leader Bernd Lapp said.
    ""It's impossible to track and return the funds. We live and
die with this technology.""

    * JV with Angelini seeks to create market for recycled
output
    * Plant near Venice already recycling disposable diapers
    * Diapers, plastics major environmental problem
    * Global awareness leaps after Chinese ban on imports 

    By Stephen Jewkes and Martinne Geller
    MILAN/LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A joint venture between
Procter & Gamble <PG.N> and Italian healthcare group Angelini is
working to create a sustainable recycling loop that would allow
dirty diapers to be turned into plastic bottle caps and viscose
clothing. 
    More than 20 million tonnes of disposable diapers are burned
or dumped in landfills globally every year - a major
environmental problem since their use became widespread in the
1960s and 1970s.
    Part of the problem is that collecting, cleaning and
breaking diapers into their component parts - plastic, cellulose
and super absorbent polymer - is tricky and expensive. 
    The other issue is that no-one has been able to establish a
market for the recycled output, dooming previous commercial
efforts to failure.
    Fater, a Pescara, Italy-based business that became a joint
venture in 1992, believes it will be able to address these
issues, backed by governments, consumers and other companies
goaded into action by a new global awareness of the looming
crisis of plastics pollution.
    The new Italian government, in particular, has made finding
""circular economy"" solutions a pillar of its populist agenda.   
    ""Nappies are made of the highest quality plastics and we've
shown they can be recycled to extract high-value building
blocks,"" says Marcello Somma, Fater's director of research and
development and business development.
    For P&G, the world's leading diaper maker and one of the
biggest contributors to the problem with nearly 27 percent of
the $44 billion diaper market, Fater ticks several boxes.
    P&G aims to be able to recycle absorbent hygiene products
(AHP), as diapers, incontinence pads and feminine hygiene
products are known, in 10 cities by 2030, according to its
latest sustainability agenda. In the long term, it hopes to use
100 percent renewable or recycled materials for all products and
packaging.
    Roberto Marinucci, P&G's vice president of global baby
wipes, sustainability and the joint venture, said the company
had still not established whether consumers would be willing to
pay a premium for diapers they know are going to be recycled,
but it was clear they want brands to care about the environment.
    ""We believe that the first reason, which is doing the right
thing for the consumer, is sufficient enough to convince us to
go ahead with the project,"" Marinucci said in an interview.
    Under EU regulations, Fater cannot sell the output of its
diaper recycling operation, located near Venice, until it proves
there is a market for it. To that end, it has been working on
prospective clients and now has 11 letters of intent with
businesses like bioplastic manufacturers and paper mills.
    P&G is also part of an EU-backed group of 13 companies
developing end products for the output. They include bioplastic
manufacturer, Novamont, which can use the cellulose to make
pharmaceutical ingredients. 
    Fater says the plastic from recycled diapers can be used to
make school desks and urban playgrounds, cellulose can become
viscose fabric or specialty paper, and super-absorbent polymer
can be used in gardening and flood barriers.
    P&G has no plans to use Fater's output in its diapers, which
include Pampers and Luvs, until it completes consumer research
on the idea, Marinucci said. In the interim, he said, the
company may use the plastics for bottle caps. 
    The biggest delay to the project has been regulatory,
Marinucci said, but he predicts it will get the EU green light
in the next 12 months.     
    In the meantime, after several years in development, Fater's
plant is operating at about a third of its 10,000-tonne annual
capacity to provide samples and build stockpiles.
    The plant expects to generate annual revenue equal to 50
percent of the cost of its machinery, Marinucci said. 
    ""We're working on well-grounded assumptions, but they're
still assumptions,"" he said. If it works, it could be expanded.
    
    CHINA STOPS WASTE IMPORTS
    Government efforts to resolve the problem of plastics
pollution gained urgency last year when China announced it would
stop importing foreign waste. China in 2016 took in 7.3 million
tonnes of waste plastics - 56 percent of world imports.    
    Fater is not the first to attempt diaper recycling. UK-based
Knowaste was forced to close its 70,000 tonne-per-year recycling
plant in Holland in 2007 after a new incinerator beat it on cost
and it was unable to find markets for the final product.
    Efforts to open another facility have failed so far but
Knowaste continues to invest in technology and is now
considering a plant in the Middle East.
    ""We were way ahead of the curve and maybe went too soon. But
the market is now showing clear signs of maturing,"" said company
CEO Roy Brown.
    Fater's patented process starts with local waste management
utility Contarina SpA, which collects used diapers and other AHP
from curbside bins or large users like hospitals from more than
50 local towns, trucking them in to the 1,000-sq metre plant.
    After dry cleaning the diapers using contact steam and
disposing of the human waste in waste water treatment plants,
one tonne of AHP waste can yield 150 kg of cellulose, 75 kg of
absorbing material and 75 kg of mixed plastic.
    Starting at the end of 2020, a small-scale biorefinery in
Amsterdam will be able to process the recovered secondary raw
materials and convert them into biologically-based products like
biodegradeable plastics and biofertilizers.
    Guy Schanschieff, founder of UK-based reusable diaper brand
Bambino Mio, says he has seen others try and fail to recycle
diapers over the years. For one thing, busy parents can't always
deposit diapers in the required bins, he said. 
    ""At the end of the day, it's a disposable product and it's
going to be thrown away,"" said Schanschieff, who is also
chairman of the Nappy Alliance trade group.
    ""Not creating the waste in the first place is always going
to be the best thing.""

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Government bond yields across the
euro area rose on Thursday, pushed up by hints of more rate
hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and in anticipation of a
wave of fresh supply from France, Spain and Italy.
    Indeed, the bond sell off was led by Italy with the gap
between 10-year bond yields and German peers moving back towards
five-year highs seen last week at around 315 basis points. 
    The U.S. central bank is largely united on the need to raise
borrowing costs further, minutes released on Wednesday from the
Fed's September meeting showed. 
    Every Fed policymaker backed the September decision to raise
the target policy rate to between 2 percent and 2.25 percent,
according to the minutes . [nL2N1WX1D2]
    That pushed up U.S. Treasury yields, setting the tone for
the start of European trade with bond investors also positioning
for new supply.
    France is expected to sell up to 8 billion euros of bonds,
Spain is tipped to auction almost 5 billion euros of debt and
Italy is due to hold an exchange auction -- tapping five nominal
bonds in exchange for its April 2020 BTP Italia retail linker.
[nS8N1T906M]
    ""It's difficult to see anything shocking in the Fed minutes,
so maybe some investors were waiting for that come out to sell
U.S. Treasuries,"" said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer
Guntermann.
    Ten-year bond yields across the bloc rose 2-4 bps.
    Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up 2 bps at 0.48 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, up from Wednesday's two-week low at 0.45 percent. 
    Two-year German yields <DE2YT=RR> hovered near six-week lows
and with their U.S. peers <US2YT=RR> trading higher a day after
the hawkish Fed minutes, the gap between the two held close to
its widest in 30 years. 
    Italy's bond market, which had shown signs of some recovery
earlier in the week, was on the back foot again ahead of the
bond exchange.
    Italian 10-year bond yields were up 4 bps at 3.59 percent
<IT10YT=RR>. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield spread
widened to 311 bps -- its highest since Oct 9, when it hit its
widest in more than five years.
    ""Today's Spanish auction and Italian exchange create
steepening risk for peripheral curves,"" Mizuho said in a note.
    Italy's contentious 2019 budget remained in focus.
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday he
expects criticism from the European Commission on Italy's
expansionary budget. [nS8N1VJ018]

    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Germany's DIHK Chambers of
Industry and Commerce has cut its 2018 growth forecast for
Europe's largest economy to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent and
forecast a slow-down to 1.7 percent next year.
    ""Companies are noticeably more cautious about their business
outlook, we see the biggest deterioration in business
expectations in four years,"" the DIHK said on Thursday.
    According to its autumn survey entitled ""The air is getting
thinner"", companies scaled back their business expectations to
11 points from 17 points in spring. Business morale regarding
current conditions remained stable at 45 points.
    The DIHK's survey of around 27,000 managers, the biggest of
its kind in Germany, found that companies viewed shortages of
skilled labour and rising labour costs as the principal risks
for their business outlook.
    Exporters also pointed to growing risks from abroad.
    ""Given the rapid pace of change, for example in global trade
policies or digitalization - and the unclear outcome of Brexit,
it is becoming more difficult for companies to foresee a clear
trend in their business development,"" DIHK said.
    The increased uncertainty is limiting companies' willingness
to invest, with DIHK expecting gross capital investments growth
to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from 3.3 percent this year.
    Imports are expected to outpace exports both this year and
next, DIHK said, in a sign that Germany's vibrant domestic
demand is likely to provide a buffer against external shocks
such as an escalation in trade tensions or a no-deal Brexit.
    German state consumption is seen rising by 1.4 percent in
2018 and 2.5 percent in 2019 while private consumption is
forecast to increase by 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent
respectively, it said.
    Companies will continue to hire more staff this year and
next, but the pace of job creation will slow from 580,000 new
positions in 2018 to 500,000 new jobs in 2019, DIHK said.

 (Adds further comment, reaction)
    By Elizabeth Piper
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May signalled on Thursday she would consider extending a
so-called transition period ""for a matter of months"" after
Britain leaves the European Union, a move her critics say is a
betrayal of Brexit.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the EU in its
biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years, Brexit talks
have stalled over how to deal with their only land border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland.
    The problem centres on a so-called backstop - an insurance
policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the
island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions,
if a future trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Extending the transition period could mean that if a future
partnership is not ready, a backstop, which so far has been
unpalatable to the British side, would not have to be triggered.
But even an extension will not get rid of the EU's insistence
that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal.
    ""A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at this
stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation
period for a matter of months, and it would only be a matter
months,"" she told reporters on the second day of an EU summit.
    ""But the point is this is not expected to be used because we
are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in
place by the end of December 2020.""
    May has tried to use the summit in Brussels - once seen as
the stage for a possible breakthrough after more than a year of
talks - to offer a softer tone to her EU counterparts after
another such meeting last month ended in acrimony.
    Before leaving them to dine on Wednesday, May urged them to
work together. ""We have shown we can do difficult deals together
constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome,"" she told
the leaders, according to a British official. ""The last stage
will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.""
    
    ""DESPERATE""
    But the latest impasse in the talks has prompted many Brexit
supporters and even critics of Britain's departure to air their
frustration over an exit which some Brexit campaigners had said
would be the easiest deal ever.
    And the suggestion that Britain could stay firmly in the
EU's sphere for longer than the 21 months expected has fired up
those who already say Britain has already given up too much in
the negotiations. Others fear May is leading the country into a
no-deal Brexit, when Britain leaves the bloc without a deal.
    ""She is losing the confidence of colleagues of all shades of
opinion. People who have been supportive of her throughout this
process, they are close to despair at the state of this
negotiation,"" said Conservative lawmaker Nick Boles, a critic of
May who during the referendum backed remaining in the EU and now
wants to stay in the single market on an interim basis.
    ""It really is a desperate last move.""
    For many who campaigned to leave the EU, the idea of
continuing to pay into the bloc well beyond Britain leaves in
March next year is anathema. 
    ""We cannot find the money to fund our frontline police
properly, we cannot find the 2 billion pounds for the vulnerable
on Universal Credit, but we can mysteriously find billions to
bung to the EU for the unnecessary extra year,"" Conservative
lawmaker Nadine Dorries said. ""This is serious.""
    But the EU is sanguine about an extension. 
    After talks stalled over the weekend, one of the bloc's
negotiators told diplomats that Brussels had proposed extending
the transition by a year to make its proposal for an Irish
backstop -- already ruled out by Britain -- more palatable.
    The idea, diplomats said, was being ""tentatively explored"".

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte on Thursday denied any division between the two parties in
his governing coalition, the League and the 5-Star Movement,
amid reports of a spat over tax revenues in next year's budget.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the
5-Star, said on Wednesday a legislative text on a partial tax
amnesty had been manipulated before its final approval. He did
not clarify who could have amended the document. 
    The tax amnesty is one of the revenue measures included in
Italy's draft budget for next year.
    Asked by reporters about a possible rift between the
far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star on the issue,
Conte - who is not from any political party - replied: ""There is
no division"".
    In a bid to fulfil election spending pledges, Italy's
eurosceptic government plans to boost welfare spending, cut the
retirement age and hike the country's deficit, upsetting the
European Commission.
    ""I'm aware this is not the budget the Commission expected. I
expect critical observations. We will discuss and we will reply
to these considerations,"" Conte told reporters on arriving for a
summit of European Union leaders in Brussels.
    He also described the Italian draft budget as ""beautiful"".
    The EU Commission is currently reviewing Rome's budgetary
plans and can formally raise concerns about it until next
Monday. 
    If it does so, it can then decide to send the budget back to
Rome for changes by Oct. 29, in what would be an unprecedented
move.

 (Adds quotes, details)
    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Germany's Chambers of Industry
and Commerce DIHK on Thursday cut its 2018 growth forecast to
1.8 percent from 2.2 percent and predicted a slowdown to 1.7
percent next year as Europe's largest economy faces mounting
risks at home and abroad.
    The forecasts are based on the assumption that global trade
disputes do not escalate and Britain does not crash out of the
European Union without a deal, as companies cited a shortage of
skilled labour as a particular domestic concern.
    ""The air is getting thinner, the concerns are getting
bigger,"" DIHK Managing Director Martin Wansleben said.
    ""Companies are noticeably more cautious about their business
outlook, we see the biggest deterioration in business
expectations in four years.""
    Wansleben said the revised forecast was ""disappointing"" but
there was no risk of recession.
    According to the DIHK autumn survey, companies scaled back
business expectations to 11 points from 17 in spring. Morale
regarding current conditions remained at 45 points.
    The survey of around 27,000 managers, the biggest of its
kind, found that companies viewed shortages of skilled labour
and rising labour costs as the principal risks for their
business outlook. Construction, transport and health services
were among the sectors most affected.
    Wansleben called on government and parliament to quickly
pass a planned immigration law to attract more skilled workers
from outside the European Union. [nL8N1WI1US]
    ""But a modern immigration law is not enough. Germany also
needs to do more to become a more attractive, more welcoming
place for foreigners - otherwise nobody will come,"" he said.    
    Protectionist U.S. trade policies and Brexit remained a
concern, limiting willingness to invest. DIHK expects gross
capital investments growth to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from
3.3 percent this year.
    ""Given the rapid pace of change, for example in global trade
policies or digitalization - and the unclear outcome of Brexit,
it is becoming more difficult for companies to foresee a clear
trend in their business development,"" DIHK said.
    Imports should outpace exports this year and next, DIHK
said, a sign that domestic demand can provide a buffer against
external shocks.
    DIHK saw state consumption rising 1.4 percent in 2018 and
2.5 percent in 2019, while private consumption is forecast to
increase 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent.
    Companies will continue to hire more staff this year and
next, but the pace of job creation will slow from 580,000 new
positions in 2018 to 500,000 in 2019, DIHK said.

    * Issues such as steel, cyber attacks, WTO on the agenda

    By Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union will seek
Asian support for free trade, the Iran nuclear deal and
combating global warming at a regional summit on Thursday that
includes China, Japan and Russia as a counterbalance to a more
protectionist United States.
    Leaders from the European Union, Switzerland and Norway will
welcome 21 Asian counterparts including China's Premier Li
Keqiang after an EU summit dominated by negotiations over
Britain's departure from the world's biggest trading bloc.
    The 51 gathered leaders are set to show ""strong support"" for
the World Trade Organisation that U.S. President Donald Trump
had threatened to quit, and express ""profound alarm"" about
climate change, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters.
    Leaders representing 55 percent of global trade will
underline ""their joint commitment to open, free and
non-discriminatory trade"" and ""to fight all forms of
protectionism"", according to the draft.
    Trump says the United States is treated badly in global
trade and has blamed the WTO for allowing that to happen.
Separately, the United States and China have imposed billions of
dollars of tariffs on each other's goods while Trump has also
complained about an unfair EU trade surplus with Washington.
    ""This is a message that the European Union is more than
Brexit and that Europe has friends beyond Washington,"" said a
senior EU official involved in preparing the summit, which has
taken place every two years since 1996.
    On Friday, the EU will sign a free-trade deal with
Singapore. The bloc is also pushing for approval for another
free-trade agreement with Vietnam. [nL8N1WX4H4]
    However, the European Union is trying not to side with China
against the United States. On Tuesday, EU trade chief Cecilia
Malmstrom held talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in
Brussels on improving trade ties, although Washington accused
the bloc of moving too slowly in negotiations. [nL8N1WX60M]
    
    FROM STEEL TO CYBER ATTACKS
    The EU-Asia summit meeting will also pressure Beijing to
combat what Europe says is China's harmful overproduction of
steel and the final statement is set to say that leaders agreed
to tackle ""excess capacity in industrial sectors"", according to
the draft, which could still be modified by diplomats.
    China, which produces and consumes half the world's steel
and, has cut some 220 million tonnes of capacity since January
2016. But the European Union remains intent on pressuring China
to cut more, as well as to remove subsidies - a policy that the
West says is aimed at dominating global markets.
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to
discuss subsidies with Li at a lunch on Friday, diplomats said.
    Bolstering the Iran nuclear deal signed by global powers in
2016, and that Trump has withdrawn from, is also another
priority of the summit. 
    Leaders will call on North Korea to ""completely, verifiably
and irreversibly dismantle all its nuclear and weapons of mass
destruction"", according to the draft final statement.
    Leaders will re-commit to the Paris climate pact that Trump
pulled out of, pledging to develop more clean energy.
    Another sensitive issue is wording in the final communique
on cyber attacks and stopping computer hackers. 
    Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev will attend the
summit but it is not clear if Moscow, accused by the West of a
global hacking campaign, will agree to proposed language calling
for an end to such attacks. [nL8N1WX3LS]
    Russia denies any responsibility for cyber attacks.

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian government bond
yields continued to ease on Thursday, but levels remained
relatively elevated, attracting investors despite a rise in
yields in Europe and the United States.
    A rapid rise in yields in recent weeks has encouraged
foreign investors to enter Central Europe's most volatile bond
market, traders and analysts said. 
    Hungarian yields dropped 1-3 basis points along the curve on
Thursday, with 10-year paper <HU10YT=RR> trading at 3.73 percent
as buyers continued to step in. 
    That was only 1 basis point lower from Wednesday, but in the
previous session the yield fell 20 basis points, while yields
were rising in developed markets and in other Central European
countries.
    Ten-year yields in Germany <DE10YT=RR> and Poland were 2
basis points higher at 0.48 and 3.21 percent respectively on
Thursday.   
    Earlier this month the yield on Hungary's 10-year bond rose
around 40 basis points as inflation worries, coupled with the
lowest short-term interest rates in the European Union's eastern
wing, made long-term paper vulnerable.
    ""After the rise in the yield to near 4 percent, it has
become attractive, and buyers arrived, mainly from abroad,"" said
Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at Raiffeisen.
    ""The 4 percent level could be approached again later this
year, and that could trigger inflows from abroad,"" he added.
    The forint-denominated bond holdings of foreign investors
<.HUBONDHOLD> remains near its highest levels since 2015.
    Recent comments from government's debt management agency and
central bank officials about a desire to channel more retail
savings into the government bond market may have contributed to
the retreat of domestic yields, one Budapest-based trader said.
    A rise in Hungary's annual inflation to 3.6 percent in
September, the highest since early 2013, kept attention focused
on price developments amid worries that the central bank may not
act in time to rein in inflation.
    In neighbouring Romania, a rise in inflation to above 5
percent by the middle of this year has also boosted government
bond yields. 
    As inflation is expected to retreat in coming months, 3-year
Romanian bonds offered at an auction on Thursday should attract
sufficient demand, Raiffeisen analyst Stephan Imre said.
    ""(Romanian government bonds) come out good on our real yield
measures in the short to medium term,"" he said in a note.
    ""We nevertheless reiterate looming fiscal risks that should
finally increase the pressure on the central bank to recommence
rate hikes in 2019,"" he added.

 (Recasts with EU leaders comments, context)
    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's prime minister on
Thursday denied any division between the two parties in his
governing coalition, after reports of a spat over tax revenues,
and insisted Rome will move ahead with planned expansionary
budgetary measures.
    His remarks came as European Union leaders raised concerns
about Rome's extravagant budgetary plans that could further
increase Italy's public debt, which, at 133 percent of gross
domestic product, is the largest in the EU after Greece. 
    In what could be a further source of concern, Deputy Prime
Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star party, said on
Wednesday a legislative text on a partial tax amnesty had been
""manipulated"" before its final approval.
    The anti-establishment 5-Star has always opposed amnesties -
a frequently used policy in Italy where people or companies can
avoid being pursued for tax dodging by paying a fee. Its
coalition partner, the far-right League, favours amnesties,
which bring money into the treasury and are popular with voters.
    Di Maio did not clarify who could have amended the document.
    Asked by reporters about a possible coalition rift, Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte - who is not from any political party -
replied: ""There is no division"".
    Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, Conte acknowledged
that budget plans to boost welfare spending, cut the retirement
age and hike the deficit were unlikely to please the European
Commission, which polices euro zone states' fiscal policies.
    The Commission says the budget is likely to breach EU fiscal
rules and increase debt.
    ""I'm aware this is not the budget the Commission expected. I
expect critical observations. We will discuss and we will reply
to these considerations,"" Conte told reporters.
    On Wednesday Conte said he saw no room for changing tack and
on Thursday described the budget as ""beautiful"".
    At the summit, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said
fiscal rules should be respected by all, adding: ""Too much debt
is dangerous.""
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at a meeting with Conte on
Wednesday, called for ""positive dialogue"" between Italy and the
EU on the budget [nL8N1WX6VL].    
    EU leaders may ask Conte about the budget at the summit,
although it is not on the agenda.
    In its review of Rome's budgetary plans, the EU Commission
can raise concerns until Monday. It could then decide to send
the budget back for changes by Oct. 29, in what would be an
unprecedented move that is likely to cause further market
turmoil [nL8N1WV23B]. 
    Yields on Italian benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after
elections in March [IT527480=].

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Spanish bank shares fell sharply
on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruled that banks and not
clients must pay stamp duty related to mortgage loans
potentially costing lenders billions of euros in compensation. 
    ""The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,"" the court
said in a document.
    Spanish banks were severely hit after the 2008 property
crash which sent the economy in to a five-year downward spiral
and mortgages remain an important part on lenders' balance
sheets, especially those focused on the domestic market.
    After the court ruling, Bankia <BKIA.MC> fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Caixabank <CABK.MC>
fell 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.
    The decision is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders
after a European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that
banks had to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with
interest rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Bank of Spain initially said then that the lenders would
have to repay customers more than 4 billion euros ($4.6
billion)after Europe's top court overturned a previous Spanish
ruling that capped liabilities related to a disputed mortgage
clause.
    On Thursday, neither the Bank of Spain nor the Spanish
banking association AEB gave any estimates for potential costs
for Spanish lenders.
($1 = 0.8680 euros)

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 18: Fitch Ratings has upgraded Malta-based business 
jet owner and operator VistaJet Group Holding Limited's (VistaJet) Long-Term 
Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'B' from 'B-'. The Outlook is Positive.

Fitch has also upgraded the 'B-'/'RR4' rating of the USD300 million 7.75% notes 
due 2020 to 'B+'/RR3. The notes are co-issued by VistaJet's 99.5%-owned 
subsidiaries, VistaJet Malta Finance P.L.C. and VistaJet Co Finance LLC, and are 
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by VistaJet and its main 
subsidiaries.

The upgrade reflects VistaJet's recent operating performance, which was better 
than Fitch's expectation. It also incorporates continued reduction of funds from 
operations (FFO) gross adjusted leverage. The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's 
expectation of continued improvement in financial profile due to growth in 
EBITDA and FFO, and the use of sizeable free cash flow (FCF) to reduce 
outstanding debt. This will lead to reduction in leverage, which we forecast to 
decrease to about 7x in 2019 from 9.8x in 2017 and be close to the positive 
rating guideline of 6x by end-2020. 

The upgrade of the notes rating reflects the higher IDR and an improved recovery 
rating cap for Malta in accordance with Fitch's Country-Specific Treatment of 
Recovery Ratings criteria.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Improving Performance: VistaJet's financial performance for 2017 was better than 
Fitch's previous rating case with improving EBITDA margin due to the increasing 
aircraft utilisation. We expect revenue growth driven by continued improvement 
in fleet utilisation to result in improving EBITDA and cashflow margins, 
reducing FFO leverage. 

Credit Metrics Strengthening: VistaJet's suspension of fleet growth at 72 
aircraft is allowing it to build aircraft utilisation and generate stronger 
cashflow. Fitch expects FFO gross adjusted leverage to fall to about 7x in 2019 
and be close to the positive rating guideline of 6x by end-2020. FFO 
fixed-charge cover is forecast to improve to over 3x by 2020 from 2.1x at 
end-2017.

Enlarged Group Positive: VistaJet Group Holding is now a fully owned subsidiary 
of Vista Global Holdings, which has recently agreed to acquire XO Management 
Holding Inc. (XO, rated B/Positive), the third largest on-demand executive jet 
services provider in the US. We believe the credit profile of VistaJet benefits 
from the restrictions on dividend payments, primarily to half of net income 
(restricted payments carve-outs) limiting the risk of cash leakage. Restricted 
payments are subject to debt incurrence covenants of fixed-charge cover ratio of 
2x, debt to assets ratio of 80% and minimum net worth of USD150 million 
stipulated in its bond documentation. 

The benefit from the enlarged group will primarily flow from opportunities to 
cross-sell the VistaJet offering to XO's customers. We have not included the 
benefit of this acquisition into VistaJet's rating. 

Fleet Growth on Hold: Fitch views the suspension of fleet growth at 72 aircraft 
as a credit positive as it allows the company to improve its aircraft 
utilisation and therefore cashflow without incurring additional leverage beyond 
2018. Fitch expects VistaJet to substantially increase its operating hours per 
aircraft, which should result in significant increases in FCF. However, a 
reduction in demand for executive jet purchases, driven by weakening economic 
growth, could add uncertainty to demand for VistaJet's services.

Network Growth Improving Utilisation: VistaJet's success in registering aircraft 
in the US as well as operating in China is a substantial boost to its 
competitiveness, allowing it to operate domestically, as well as 
internationally, increasing utilisation rates and reducing ferrying. As a 
result, we expect the number of hours flown per aircraft to increase gradually 
from 2018. Fitch also expects VistaJet to increase the yield per flight hour, 
supported by increases in Flight Solutions Program agreements. 

DERIVATION SUMMARY

VistaJet's business model is well positioned compared with other aircraft 
operators. Fitch views VistaJet as operating a niche product that is 
differentiated from airlines in terms of its cost and revenue structures. Unlike 
commercial airlines, such as Air Canada (BB-/Positive) and Public Joint Stock 
Company Aeroflot - Russian Airlines (BB-/Stable), VistaJet does not operate a 
fixed route timetable. Nor does it operate its fleet as heavily, with fleet 
utilisation of less than 900 hours per aircraft and a high operating margin. 
VistaJet offers both lower all-in costs and higher flexibility than partly used 
corporate jets. In addition, VistaJet's revenue is supported by contractual 
income and increasing luxury spending by high-net-worth individuals. This is 
offset by substantially higher debt leverage than its airline peers.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer

- number of aircraft to remain at 72 in 2018 with no growth till 2021;

- average fleet yield to stay stable;

- utilisation below management plan with gradual increase every year for the 
next five years. Utilisation increase to 830 hours per aircraft in 2018 from 741 
hours for 2017;

- fuel, handling, flight control, maintenance and catering costs to grow in line 
with growth in flight hours;

- personnel expenses, and depreciation and amortisation costs are semi-variable; 


- 2018-2022 capex in line with management's expectations; 

- no dividend over 2018-2022.

Key Recovery Rating Assumptions

- the recovery analysis of VistaJet is driven by liquidation value. We have 
assumed a 10% administrative claim. We excluded aircraft under lease from net 
property, plant and equipment calculation as finance leases are not part of the 
waterfall in this recovery analysis. 

- we assumed an 85% advance rate for net property, plant and equipment given 
that the company's aircraft are new and we assume they will preserve market 
value.

- the waterfall results in a 67% recovery corresponding to 'RR3' recovery for 
the senior unsecured debt. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

- FFO gross adjusted leverage consistently lower than 6x, FFO fixed-charge cover 
above 2.5x along with continued improvement in aircraft utilisation rates 
leading to improvement in profit margins and high revenue visibility. 

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action 

- FFO gross adjusted leverage sustainably above 8x (2017: 9.8x), decline in FFO 
fixed-charge cover below 2x, or reduction in the company's contracted revenue to 
below 40% of total revenue (61% in 2Q18). 

- The notes' rating may also be downgraded if our expectation for recovery rates 
fall below 51%.

- A revision of Outlook to Stable from Positive could be driven by inability to 
continue on the expected deleveraging path, which could result from a 
significant decline in profitability and the use of FCF to fund capex or 
shareholder returns. 

LIQUIDITY

VistaJet's liquidity profile is dominated by the high-rate amortisation of its 
aircraft related debt at a rate of about USD200 million a year. VistaJet's 
liquidity is driven by Fitch's expectation of sizeable FCF generation averaging 
about USD150 million a year in 2018-2022 and cash of USD81.5 million at 
end-2017. VistaJet remains reliant on refinancing existing amortising amounts 
within its 85% debt to assets incurrence test, which Fitch expects to be secured 
against the aircraft.

    By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
    NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - When Peggy and Marco
Lachmann-Anke learned in January that hackers cracked a
40-character password and cleaned out their cryptocurrency
wallet, they did not go to the police or alert the tokens'
issuer, the Berlin-based technology group IOTA.
    They bought more coins.
    The Cyprus-based German couple, who describe themselves as
financial educators, figured they had no chance of recovering
the coins and it was not even clear who might take up their
case. Yet they took the roughly $14,000 loss in stride -
something that comes with the territory when one bets on a new,
exciting technology in a yet unregulated market.
    ""We really believe in cryptocurrencies. We have studied this
for about a year before investing, so we are aware of the
risks,"" Peggy Lachmann-Anke said. ""There was nothing we could
do."" 
    Far from unusual, the episode is emblematic for a market
where few rules apply and where investors' faith in the
blockchain technology goes hand in hand with the belief that it
also helps criminals cover their tracks so well that trying to
catch them is a fool's errand.
    Patrick Wyman, FBI supervisory special agent at the
financial crimes section of the agency's anti-money laundering
unit acknowledges cryptocurrencies pose some unique challenges.
    ""A decentralized currency system like bitcoin, or another
form of virtual currency is not governed by any entity,
suspicious reporting activity, and any anti-money laundering
compliance,"" Wyman told Reuters.     
    Various estimates show cryptocurrency crime is on the rise,
keeping pace with the market's rapid growth. That forces
investigators to focus on high-profile cases, security
professionals and officials say, effectively leaving small
investors to their own devices.
    ""We do not pretend that every law enforcement agency is
devoting resources to every single crime. That would not be
possible,"" said Jaroslav Jakubcek, an analyst at Europol, which
serves as a center for the European Union's law enforcement
cooperation, expertise and intelligence.
    
    UNREPORTED CASES
    Officials still encourage people to report cryptocurrency
theft to local police like any other crime saying failing to do
so only emboldens criminals.
    Yet because many victims simply do not see the point,
cryptocurrency theft is far more common than any published
estimates suggest, security professionals say.
    According to financial research firm Autonomous NEXT and
Crypto Aware, which works with investors affected by crypto
scams, about 15 percent of cryptocurrencies have been stolen
between 2012 and the first half of 2018, representing a
cumulative $1.7 billion in value at the time of the theft and
with a rising tendency. In the first half of this year alone,
more than $800 million has already been stolen, according to the
data. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Nq3ngy)
   Yet Lex Sokolin, a partner and global director of fintech
strategy at the firm, estimates that as much as 85 percent of
crimes go unreported and says the published statistics only
represent publicly reported heists.
    Reuters interviews with half a dozen victims paint a similar
picture. Out of that group only two reported their losses to the
authorities and one soured on cryptocurrency investments.
    Armin Fischer, a Vienna-based IT specialist said he lost
about $5,300 in ether coins in a phishing scam in the summer of
2017 and immediately alerted the local police just to find out
that the duty officer had no idea what he was talking about.
     He said it took many months of knocking on doors to get his
case ultimately taken up by Vienna prosecutors' office, but it
is still pending. Fisher says by now he has had enough.
    ""I have seen firsthand how big the security leaks are.""
    Others are more philosophical.
    Dave Appleton, a blockchain developer for HelloGold, a gold
trading app company in Kuala Lumpur, said he lost about $3,000
of ether coins when scammed by a fake site touting a startup's
token pre-sale. He said he just moved on, glad he did not lose
more.
    ""The point is there's no one to report the crime to,""
Appleton said. ""I am not sure what country or jurisdiction it
would come under.""    
    According ICO tracker Coinschedule a record $21.3 billion
flowed into new tokens so far this year as investors keep
snapping up ""initial coin offerings,"" undeterred by high-profile
heists, bitcoin's and other currencies' slide from late 2017
peaks, and government warnings of widespread fraud and theft.
    
    MILLIONS AT STAKE
    David Jevans, chief executive of cybersecurity firm
CipherTrace in Menlo Park, California, estimates that even when
exchanges or trading platforms get hacked, perhaps only a fifth
of stolen coins is recovered because of the ease with which
digital tokens can move across several borders. [nL2N1SU2GP] 
    ""You have to get law enforcement in five countries
interested enough, have time enough, and have evidence enough to
open a case,"" he said. ""By the time they agree, get the
information, do all the paperwork, the money has been moved.""
    Security experts say in most cases millions need to be at
stake to justify such an effort. 
    U.S. entrepreneur and long-time cryptocurrency investor
Michael Terpin, who says he got robbed twice, learned firsthand
that not all hacks are created equal.
    He said first time when criminals accessed his cellphone
with stolen SIM card credentials, emptied a wallet connected to
it, and tricked his friends into sending money by impersonating
him on Skype, he contacted a friend at the FBI.
    But once she learned that only $60,000 got stolen, she
advised him to file a report via the FBI's internet crime center
website. Terpin said he did, but never heard back.
    Then, when last January he lost almost $24 million in tokens
from his mobile account, he went straight after the service
provider AT&T, filing a $224 million lawsuit accusing it of
negligence that allowed ""digital identity theft,"" a claim AT&T
denies. [nL1N1V51U5] 
    Undeterred, Terpin says he remains committed to blockchain,
comparing it to the early days of Amazon.com Inc when the online
retailer faced much skepticism and even derision.
    ""That's similar to today's narrative that all ICOs (initial
coin offerings) are scams and nothing will ever be developed of
value because they're not already fully deployed,"" he said.
    Steadfast commitment to the new technology and belief that
it gives sophisticated criminals the upper hand mean that even
some multimillion heists go unreported.
    For example, when hackers stole about $9 million worth of
ether tokens from a Zug, Switzerland-based company Swarm City in
July 2017, the peer-to-peer digital platform did not report the
theft to the police, business leader Bernd Lapp said.
    ""It's impossible to track and return the funds. We live and
die with this technology.""

    By Lidia Kelly, Justyna Pawlak and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk 
    WARSAW, Oct. 18 (Reuters) - Last winter, Monika Pawlik spent
her days crawling through mud and digging trenches in frozen
ground, training for Poland's home guard. Her daughter, Helena,
hadn't yet turned 2 years old.
    The town hall clerk is under no illusions about the
potential risks of serving in the volunteer army, saying she is
ready to die for the homeland. ""I understand that if there is a
war, formations such as ours are sent to their death,"" she says.
""I think that I mainly did it for myself and probably from
feeling a patriotic duty.""
    Pawlik is a citizen of the European Union, but the
24-year-old's commitment to defend her nation reflects a
mounting unease throughout Poland and elsewhere in the EU.
Nearly 15,000 Poles have joined the country's volunteer forces
since their inception in 2017, a number that Poland's military
planners hope will reach 53,000 in the coming years. 
    Poland is a fully paid-up member of NATO. As the biggest
state to join the EU from the former Soviet bloc, it has
received more EU support than any other member - over 100
billion euros ($115 billion), according to the Polish finance
ministry. EU membership is popular. But many Poles - alongside
Hungarians and Czechs in eastern Europe - are voicing discontent
over foreign influence in their internal affairs. For instance,
Poland and Hungary have defied an EU request to accept a quota
of asylum-seekers. Parties like Poland's ruling Law and Justice
(PiS) are winning support by beating a patriotic drum, and the
EU is among the targets.
    This trend has deepened fractures across the Union, which
commentators widely believe are rooted in financial crisis and
the subsequent arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants from
Syria and Africa. In Poland and other European countries that
broke free from Soviet domination in 1989, however, the
misgivings have long run far deeper.
    Pawlik lives in a village of only several dozen people about
150 km (90 miles) from the eastern border with Russia's ally
Belarus. Her small house, inherited from her grandmother, is
adorned with pots of white and red flowers in the windows. She
planted them with her husband as a tribute to Poland's
white-and-red flag, to honour the centenary of Polish
independence this year.
    ""I remember my grandmother telling me how the Germans used
to pass through these forests and then the Russians,"" said
Pawlik. ""She would tell me how a Russian would sometimes just go
over and shoot your head off and a German would shrug, pretend
not to see you and walk away.""
    Many Poles recall bitter experiences in World War Two when
Western allies failed to save the country from a Nazi German
invasion and, later, allowed it to fester under Soviet
domination. The PiS party, which won 37.6 percent of the vote
and secured a parliamentary majority in 2015, is appealing
mainly to rural, less educated and poorer voters who feel that
while Europe's liberal ways may have made some people richer,
they have not made anyone safer.
    Poland's government has allied with Hungary, whose prime
minister, Viktor Orban, has courted confrontation with Brussels
as part of what he calls a ""national liberation struggle""
against globalisation and the liberal ideas of the EU. PiS
leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski has said Poland is following Orban's
example. Both states have railed against internationalist
left-wingers and courted nationalist leaders such as Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump.
    ""We renounce this sack of stones we have been carrying on
our backs as a nation since 1989,"" Kaczynski told crowds
celebrating Polish Independence Day last Nov. 11. ""A sack of
corruption, abuse, theft, dishonesty, immorality and destruction
of Polish patriotism, Poland's sense of community.""
    Many of Poland's EU allies are angry that its government is
playing a leading role in fuelling a rift between ex-Communist
and Western members of the bloc, at a time when the EU is
grappling with Britain's decision to leave. They have accused
Warsaw of a tilt towards authoritarianism, as the state
increases its control of the judiciary, public media and parts
of the economy.
    In Brussels, senior EU officials say parties like PiS create
a false distinction between patriotism and a sense of European
community. ""Patriotism is a virtue,"" European Commission
President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a speech in September.
""Unchecked nationalism is riddled with both poison and deceit.""
    Finding itself increasingly isolated within the bloc, the
PiS government has also been more combative with Berlin, once a
leading champion of Poland's EU membership aspirations. Warsaw
says Germany still owes it billions of euros in World War Two
reparations, and has told Poles that Berlin should pay the money
back.
    A German government spokeswoman said: ""The federal
government currently has no official request from Poland in
relation to reparations claims on which it could comment.""
    
    INSECURITY
    Pawlik says she has no political views, but she is part of
the core electorate for the PiS government. Its bedrock of
support is rural communities, especially in the country's east.
    Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, a large part of the cash
it received has been devoted to big projects like roads and
bridges. But under PiS, individual incomes in rural areas have
also been helped by government programmes to give new child
benefits and increase the minimum wage.
    For Pawlik and others, Brussels has disappointed at a more
basic level. Since Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine in
2014, many people in Poland say they have been nervous of
Russian aggression. Before Russia annexed Crimea four years ago,
just 15 percent of Poles worried that their country's
independence may be under threat. That jumped after Russia
intervened in Ukraine, and the number runs at 40 percent now.
    There has recently been a massive build-up of Russian
conventional forces on the borders of the Baltic states. But the
EU has very limited joint defence capabilities. 
    This is why people like Pawlik joined the Territorial
Defence Forces (WOT) - a formation that requires recruits to
spend four months over three years in training. The force,
modelled on America's National Guard, is an integral part of
Poland's defence and deterrence potential alongside land, air,
navy and special operations, the defence ministry says. Poland's
military budget for 2018 envisages spending $153 million on the
territorial defence forces, similar to the amount earmarked for
the navy.
    Poland's government has been spending around 2 percent of
GDP on defence, as recommended by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, and is planning to gradually raise this amount to
2.5 percent of GDP.
    ""Military treaties are important but they can give an often
illusory sense of power. We need to be ready to defend ourselves
... until our allies arrive with help,"" Tadeusz Cymanski, a
senior PiS lawmaker, said in an interview. ""If we want to
preserve our independence, the current generation ought to have
a sense of national pride, a sense of community and a
willingness to sacrifice.""
    A volunteer army is an important symbol. Poland has for
centuries been invaded or carved up by its neighbours - Austria,
Germany and Russia until 1918, and later, Nazi Germany and the
Soviet Union. In World War Two, hundreds of thousands of Poles
joined an underground Home Army to defend the country after its
government was forced into exile.
    A poll by the state-controlled polling agency CBOS showed in
August that 88 percent of the population today believes being
patriotic means being willing to fight and die for the country.
    
   ""TOWARDS MATURITY""
    Being in the EU has disappointed Poles in other ways. After
Poland joined, labour markets opened up abroad. Poles left in
droves to seek work, dividing families and draining local
labour.
    More than 2 million, out of a population of over 38 million
Poles, recently moved to live abroad, drawn out of important
services such as healthcare to countries including Britain and
Germany. The population of Pawlik's county, Ostrow Mazowiecka,
has fallen by almost three percent since 2004 and she worries
there may not be enough people to help defend those who stayed
behind.
    ""I hope Helena never moves abroad,"" said Pawlik, playing
with her daughter in her garden. ""I hope she has a better sense
of what her ancestors have done for her. And I think her
children will not have to leave for abroad. I am not a supporter
of finding work away from home.""
    While EU membership has allowed large numbers of Poles to
seek work abroad under free movement rules, the EU says the
long-term thrust of its policy is to help narrow the gaps
between living standards across the continent.
    Overall, Poland's population has nudged up 0.7 percent, but
the government is trying to encourage more growth, primarily by
paying out generous child subsidies, promising pensions for
women who have at least four children but have not worked enough
to earn a pension, and offering cheaper public housing.
    The health ministry has also sponsored a booklet called
""Towards maturity"" for school instructors on family and
reproductive health, with a stated aim of ""preventing a tendency
to postpone procreation."" Included in it is a statement that
promiscuity ""changes a woman's psyche,"" because ""a woman's
nature is to devote herself entirely to a beloved man.""
    
    NOT GERMANY
    For Pawlik, there has also been a hollowness in EU
membership. She says she once did an internship in her local
town hall that was funded by the European Union. It paid better
than a regular internship, but she had to display a poster
saying who paid for her work. She felt it was like a plaque
saying, ""'This hinge has been oiled with EU funds.'""
    A European Commission official said such a poster is not an
EU requirement.
    Przemyslaw Sadura, a sociologist of education from the
Warsaw University Institute of Sociology, says national
governments such as Poland's are filling a void left by Brussels
in telling people stories that can motivate them and make sense
of life.
    ""The EU was not able to forge its own story, its own myth;
it couldn't weave together national stories into a single tale,""
he said. PiS, he said, ""has a vision. It encompasses patriotism,
a vision for the modernisation of Poland, a national engagement,
a national economy. It's about ethnic community.""
    EU Commission officials say they have no simple answers to
what they view as a global trend, of politicians who exploit
people's unease with change by appealing to nostalgia for a
national past. But such attitudes generate frustration that
Brussels officials rarely voice in public. ""Central Europe loves
a sense of victimisation,"" one senior EU official told Reuters
privately, acknowledging the difficulty institutions have in
responding to complaints from Warsaw and Budapest.
    As it builds its nostalgic story, PiS has introduced a
sweeping reform of school programmes, focusing in particular on
history, literature, civics and geography. From now, school
children will be taught about the ""benefits and costs"" of EU
membership, according to education ministry documents. The
ministry mandated the added word, ""costs.""
    The new core curriculum says that ""the aim of schooling is
to strengthen the sense of national identity, connection to
history and national traditions.""
    That includes Poland's status as a victim of Nazi Germany.
Many Poles feel the West has failed to acknowledge the depth of
the nation's suffering under the occupation, focusing instead
only on the Jewish Holocaust. The government says some Poles
have been unjustly vilified as perpetrators of atrocities
against the Jews. In fact, some sheltered Jews. And Poles
themselves were deemed ""sub-human"" by the Nazis.
    Earlier this year, Poland's government passed a law that
would allow the courts to jail anyone suggesting the Polish
nation was complicit in the Holocaust. Under pressure from the
United States, it later watered that down to remove jail terms. 
    At the same time, the education ministry has cancelled an
obligation for schools to give anti-discrimination workshops. A
school superintendent, appointed by PiS, recently urged
teenagers to follow the example of a 17th-century king who
fought against the Ottoman empire. The superintendent was quoted
in the media as saying the great king ""managed to defend the
whole of Europe against Islam.""
    In the fourth grade, when history is introduced as a
subject, children aged 9 to 10 are presented with vignettes of
around two dozen historic figures designed to promote a sense of
national pride. These characters are described by the education
ministry as having ""a momentous impact on the formation of the
Polish cultural identity.""
    They include Christian kings, a Polish-born Pope (John Paul
II) who inspired the nation to stand up to communism, Marie
Sklodowska-Curie, who won the Nobel Prize for her research on
radioactivity, and the Solidarity movement which spearheaded the
end of Communist rule in Europe.
    ""History should arouse pride,"" said Wlodzimierz Suleja, the
historian who developed the new programmes. ""Our history is
grand ... We were exceptional in Europe."" He says he is
referring to the fact Poles were able to sustain a sense of
nationhood when the country was overrun by others.
    To many in Poland, which has for centuries embraced
Catholicism as a way to distinguish its culture from Protestant
Germany and Orthodox Russia, religious values are fundamental.
One town has engraved marble tablets with the Ten Commandments
to be hung at the entrances to local schools.
    Pawlik says when she was at school, the system failed to
teach her an appreciation of her own heritage. ""Our system tends
to focus on teaching the history of Germany, its kings, Russia.
We didn't learn much about Poland,"" she said. ""We need to focus
on what happened here.""
    
    SACRIFICE
    At the heart of the PiS story is a group of fighters who
kept an underground resistance going even after the end of World
War Two, turning against the Communist authorities.
    PiS holds up the fighters, known as the Doomed or Cursed
Soldiers, as a model for youth, praising them for being
uncompromising, unyielding and willing to be martyred despite
having the odds stacked against them.
    Controversy surrounds them. Several have been accused of
killing civilian villagers, often Jews, Slovaks and Belarusians,
as they sought to resist Soviet authorities setting up a
Communist state in Poland.
    But they are the example for Pawlik and other fighters in
the territorial defence forces. In a ceremony in 2016, President
Andrzej Duda called them ""the last of the great heroes"" who
sacrificed their lives for the country. 
    One of the Doomed Soldiers is a woman known by her nom de
guerre, Inka. A 17-year-old medic and member of the Home Army in
World War Two, she was sentenced to death by the Communist
authorities and refused to sign a plea for clemency. Before her
death, she wrote a note to relatives, saying, ""I am sad that I
have to die. Please tell my grandmother that I behaved as one
should.""
    When Pawlik was doing her training, she says, she learned
how to fire weapons and was surprised to find she was no weaker
than the men. She wants to be a professional soldier.
    ""If I go for something, I take it to the end,"" she said.
""But I'm not doing it all for myself. I'm also doing this for
the baby.""

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Government bond yields across the
euro area rose on Thursday, pushed up by hints of more rate
hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and in anticipation of a
wave of fresh supply from France, Spain and Italy.
    The bond sell off was led by Italy, with the gap between
10-year bond yields and German peers moving back towards
five-year highs seen last week at around 315 basis points. 
    The U.S. central bank is largely united on the need to raise
borrowing costs further, minutes released on Wednesday from the
Fed's September meeting showed. 
    Every Fed policymaker backed the September decision to raise
the target policy rate to between 2 percent and 2.25 percent,
according to the minutes. [nL2N1WX1D2]
    That pushed up U.S. Treasury yields, setting the tone for
the start of European trade with bond investors also positioning

    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Some members of the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria who are under
surveillance for alleged links to extremist groups won seats in
its parliamentary election at the weekend, the state's
intelligence agency said.
    An agency spokesman said on Thursday that the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency was checking whether it has a
constitutional mandate to continue monitoring those individuals,
who are now lawmakers in the state assembly.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition is divided over
whether the federal intelligence agency should monitor the AfD,
which entered the national parliament for the first time in an
election last year after campaigning on an anti-Islam platform.
    In Bavaria, the party - which says Islam is incompatible
with the German constitution - secured 22 seats in the regional
parliament based on a little over 10 percent of the vote. It
drew some traditional voters from Merkel's conservative allies
in the state, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
    ""Among the people under surveillance by the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency are individuals who won a mandate
for the AfD in the election on Oct. 14,"" the Bavarian
intelligence service spokesman wrote in an email.
    He declined to say how many of the 22 AfD lawmakers are
under surveillance. The AfD's leader in Bavaria did not respond
to an email seeking comment. The story was first reported by the
Muenchner Merkur newspaper. 
    The intelligence agency spokesman said a low double-digit
number of AfD members were being monitored for suspected links
to anti-Islamic and ""right-wing extremist"" groups as well as to
the anti-government Reichsbuerger movement, which claims that
the modern-day Federal Republic of Germany is illegitimate.
    
    CHEMNITZ CLASHES
    Pressure grew on Merkel's government to order federal agents
to start monitoring the AfD after its supporters held protests
in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month to denounce the fatal
stabbing of a German man, allegedly by two migrants.
    Skinheads clashed with police soon after a Syrian and an
Iraqi were identified as suspects, and a mob attacked a Jewish
restaurant, exposing bitter divisions over Merkel's 2015
decision to welcome some one million, mainly Muslim migrants.
    Soon after the protests in Chemnitz, the states of Lower
Saxony and Bremen said their security services had placed the
AfD's youth wings under surveillance for suspected
unconstitutional activities.
    But Merkel rejected calls to put the AfD, now Germany's
largest opposition party, under surveillance, saying it was the
job of intelligence officials, not politicians, to make such
decisions based on facts.
    However, leaders of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD),
junior coalition partners of Merkel's conservatives, said the
clashes in Chemnitz gave clear cause for a renewed look at
whether the AfD should be monitored.
    Memories of Nazi and Communist oppression between 1933 and
1989 have made Germans very cautious about state surveillance,
but a poll published last month found that 57 percent agreed
that the AfD should be monitored.

 (Adds details)
    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Spanish bank shares fell sharply
on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruled banks must pay stamp
duty on mortgage loans, potentially costing them billions of
euros in compensation and raising pressure on their lending
business.  
    ""The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,"" the court
said in a document.
    The Supreme court ruling, which overturned a previous ruling
from earlier this year, is now final and could leave banks
potentially exposed to additional legal provisions, analysts
said.
    Spanish banks were severely hit after the 2008 property
crash which sent the economy in to a five-year downward spiral
and mortgages remain an important part on lenders' balance
sheets, especially those focused on the domestic market.
    After the court ruling, Bankia <BKIA.MC> fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Caixabank <CABK.MC>
fell 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.
    Other smaller Spanish lenders focused in Spain, such as
former regional savings banks Liberbank <LBK.MC> and Unicaja
<UNI.MC>, were also among the most severely hit, with declines
as high as 8 percent and 7 percent.
    BBVA <BBVA.MC>, Bankinter <BKT.MC> and Banco Santander
<SAN.MC> also fell between 1.5 percent and 6.4 percent.
    The ruling comes at a sensitive moment for Spanish banks as
they struggle to glean earnings from loans with interest rates
at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins.
    The decision is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders
after a European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that
banks had to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with
interest rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Bank of Spain initially said then that the lenders would
have to repay customers more than 4 billion euros ($4.60
billion) after Europe's top court overturned a previous Spanish
ruling that capped liabilities related to a disputed mortgage
clause.
    On Thursday, the Bank of Spain did not give any estimates
for potential costs for Spanish lenders.
    The Spanish banking association AEB said the ruling referred
to a tax issue and that lenders had not received any amount from
their clients for this concept. It also demanded greater legal
security and predictable rules for the mortgage market.
    The AEB said based on this ruling, banks would comply from
now on with the new criteria established by the Supreme Court.
    Analysts said it would be difficult to calculate the amount
of the cost of this sentence because, among other things, stamp
duty varies depending on the different autonomous regions.
    Spanish consumer association Adicae said that up to 8
million clients could be affected by the court ruling.
    Though the ruling does not state from when clients are
entitled to be compensated, the Spanish legal systems allows
customers to potentially reclaim any compensation from tax
authorities for cases going back four years.
    Spanish banks could end up paying anything between 1.7
billion euros and 10 billion euros in compensation, according to
analysts.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - EU authorities will raise their
concerns with Italy on Thursday over fiscal rule breaches in its
2019 budget, an official said, sending a formal warning letter
that could lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end
of the month.
    Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici will hand the
consultation letter to Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria in
Rome. 
    The EU official told Reuters the Commission was expecting a
reply from Italy, and possible changes to the draft budget,
before taking any further action.
    Italy is pressing ahead with an expansionary budget that
will boost its deficit and risks further increasing its huge
public debt pile.
    Other euro zone countries will also receive consultation
letters on their draft budgets, the official said, but only in
the case of Italy will the Commission highlight that there is a
serious deviation from EU fiscal targets.
    ""Italy's is a case apart,"" the official said. Under EU
rules, the letter to Rome could precede a Commission rejection
of the Italian budget by Oct. 29.
    With other countries, which the official declined to name,
the Commission will raise doubts about possible fiscal risks.
But only Rome will receive a letter on Thursday, while other
countries will be informed from Friday.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Moscow/London-October 18: Fitch Ratings has maintained 
Slovenia-based Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.'s (NLB) 'BB' Long-Term Issuer Default 
Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch Evolving (RWE). A full list of rating actions is at 
the end of this rating action commentary.

The RWE on NLB's ratings continues to reflect both of the following:

(i) The potential negative impact on the bank's credit profile and ratings of 
the breach of the original privatisation commitments contained in NLB's 
restructuring agreement when the state aid extended to the bank was approved in 
2011-2013. In April 2018, the European Commission (EC) launched an investigation 
in respect of this, which could result in direct financial costs for the bank 
and/or material operating restrictions. This could have a significant negative 
impact on NLB's company profile, profitability and capital, and could trigger a 
rating downgrade. For details, see ""Fitch Puts NLB on RWE; Revises Outlook on 
NKBM to Positive; Affirms 3 Other Slovenian Banks"" dated 26 April 2018 on 
www.fitchratings.com. 

(ii) The moderate upside potential for the ratings if there is no material 
negative impact on NLB from the delayed fulfilment of its privatisation 
commitments. In this case, the ratings could be upgraded by one notch, driven by 
the material improvement in NLB's financial profile in 2017-1H18, as reflected 
in the significant moderation of asset quality risks, stronger earnings, and 
solid capital and liquidity buffers.

In August 2018, the EC published a press release concluding that Slovenia's aid 
for NLB remains compatible with EU state aid rules on the basis of a new 
commitment package submitted by the Slovenian authorities on 13 July 2018. The 
new commitments stipulate the privatisation of 50% + one share in NLB by 
end-2018 and a further 25% stake in 2019. In Fitch's view, the agreement to 
extend the privatisation deadlines is credit positive, and we expect to resolve 
the RWE on NLB's ratings once the state divests a majority stake in the bank, 
thereby materially reducing the risks related to delayed fulfilment of 
privatisation commitments. On 15 October 2018, the Republic of Slovenia (acting 
through its sovereign holding company) and NLB announced the intention to 
proceed with a public offering and listing of the bank's shares on the Ljubljana 
Stock Exchange and of global depositary receipts representing NLB ordinary 
shares on the London Stock Exchange.

In Fitch's view, NLB's credit profile has remained stable over the past six 
months and continues to be commensurate with a one-notch higher rating, if not 
for the event risks stemming from the breach of initial privatisation 
commitments. NLB's impaired loans ratio (defined as loans 90 days overdue plus 
otherwise impaired loans) reduced to 9.9% at end-1H18 (end-2017: 10.8%), and 
these loans were 70% (end-2017: 79%) covered by loan loss allowances (LLA). 
Fitch believes that NLB's impaired loans definition is conservative and expects 
the impaired loans to be quite similar to stage 3 loans under IFRS 9, which are 
not disclosed on interim dates.

Net impaired loans equalled a moderate 12% of end-1H18 Fitch Core Capital (FCC). 
Earnings remained reasonable with an annualised ROAE of 12.5% in 1H18 (2017: 
14.5%), although this is partially supported by moderate impaired loan 
recoveries and corresponding reversals of LLA. Capital and liquidity buffers are 
significant, as expressed by a solid 20.5% FCC ratio at end-1H18 and a low 75% 
gross loans/deposits ratio.

KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR

NLB's Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' and Support Rating of '5' reflect 
Fitch's opinion that potential sovereign support for the bank cannot be relied 
on. This is underpinned by the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, 
which provides a framework for resolving banks that is likely to require senior 
creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead or ahead of a bank 
receiving sovereign support.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

NLB's ratings are sensitive to the fulfilment of the bank's privatisation 
commitments and hence reduction of related risks. If NLB is privatised by 
end-2018, Fitch may upgrade NLB's Long-Term IDR by one notch, reflecting its 
generally sound financial metrics.

Conversely, if the privatisation does not go ahead on time and the Slovenian 
authorities fail to nominate a trustee to dispose of the bank as required by the 
new commitments, and this leads to material financial costs and/or operational 
restrictions on NLB with a significant negative impact on its company profile, 
profitability and capital, then the ratings could be downgraded.

The rating actions are as follows:

Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.

Long-Term IDR: 'BB', maintained on RWE

Short-Term IDR: affirmed at 'B'

Viability Rating: 'bb', maintained on RWE

Support Rating: affirmed at '5'

Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor'

policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the
island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not in

    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Some members of the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria who are under
surveillance for alleged links to extremist groups won seats in
its parliamentary election at the weekend, the state's
intelligence agency said.
    An agency spokesman said on Thursday that the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency was checking whether it has a
constitutional mandate to continue monitoring those individuals,
who are now lawmakers in the state assembly.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition is divided over
whether the federal intelligence agency should monitor the AfD,
which entered the national parliament for the first time in an
election last year after campaigning on an anti-Islam platform.
    In Bavaria the party secured 22 seats in the regional
parliament based on a little over 10 percent of the vote. It
drew voters from Merkel's conservative allies in the state, the
Christian Social Union (CSU).
    ""Among the people under surveillance by the Bavarian
domestic intelligence agency are individuals who won a mandate
for the AfD in the election on Oct. 14,"" the Bavarian
intelligence service spokesman wrote in an email.
    Martin Sichert, the AfD's leader in Bavaria, told Reuters:
""This gives people the possibility to see, through the public
service of our lawmakers in the regional assembly, that there is
no justification for monitoring the AfD."" 
    The spy agency spokesman declined to say how many of the 22
AfD lawmakers were under surveillance. He said a low
double-digit number of AFD party members were being monitored
for possible ties to anti-Islamic and ""right-wing extremist""
groups.
    Pressure grew on Merkel's government to order federal agents
to start monitoring the AfD after its supporters held protests
in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month to denounce the fatal
stabbing of a German man, allegedly by two migrants.
    Skinheads clashed with police soon after a Syrian and an
Iraqi were identified as suspects, and a mob attacked a Jewish
restaurant, exposing bitter divisions over Merkel's 2015
decision to welcome some one million, mainly Muslim migrants.
    Soon after the protests in Chemnitz, the states of Lower
Saxony and Bremen said their security services had placed the
AfD's youth wings under surveillance for suspected
unconstitutional activities.
    Memories of Nazi and Communist oppression have made Germans
very cautious about state surveillance, but a poll published
last month found that 57 percent agreed that the AfD should be
monitored.

    * ""This is the deal - if ever there's to be one"" - diplomat
    * Only limited ways to salvage an agreement 

    By Gabriela Baczynska
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain
have given themselves a few more weeks to break the deadlock in
their Brexit talks but for Brussels the delay seems mainly about
Prime Minister Theresa May dealing with critics back in London.
    An accord sketched by officials from both sides last weekend
stalled because May's fractious government rejected a ""backstop""
insurance clause the EU wants in case future talks fail to forge
a trade pact that avoids customs posts on the Irish border.
    An EU offer to extend a status-quo transition period by a
year to end-2021, keeping Britain in a customs union to diminish
the chances of the backstop being triggered, was not enough.
    EU negotiator Michel Barnier pledged at a summit to keep
working ""calmly and patiently"". But many EU leaders see the main
negotiations to be had now as being among May and her allies in
London, possibly only after she gets a budget through parliament
early next month. They see little scope now for the EU to move.
    ""We took our steps. We need to know what the other side
wants - finally,"" said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite.
    Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, less than
three years since Britons voted for an exit in a referendum. 
    ""This is pretty much it,"" an EU diplomat said of the weekend
offer, which included a longer transition to give time for a
customs deal. ""This is the deal - if ever there's to be one."" 
    French President Emmanuel Macron noted the tricky ""political
balance"" May faces at home -- her vital Northern Irish allies
say the EU's backstop, by keeping Northern Ireland alone in the
EU customs area, would break up the United Kingdom; and Brexit
hardliners insist the UK must leave the EU customs union soon.
    
    ACID TEST
    All governments insist, though, that they want a deal in the
coming weeks that can avoid chaos when Britain leaves in March.
    There are limited ways to salvage an agreement.
    The EU is firmly behind Ireland. It says any ""hard border""
infrastructure on its frontier with the British province of the
island would revive sectarian conflict. Many small EU states see
the willingness of big powers to risk trade with Britain to
protect Ireland as an acid test of the value of EU membership.
    That limits May's scope for rejecting any backstop at all. 
    Her solution so far has been to offer to keep the British
mainland also inside EU customs rules for a time. But the EU has
rejected that because it says it appears to offer Britain too
many trading advantages without deeper negotiations which it is
only willing to start after Britain has left the Union.
    Yet if a deal is to be struck, the focus will be finding a
formulation that makes a customs border between Northern Ireland
and the British mainland highly improbable and/or makes a UK-EU
future customs zone more certain than Brussels now wants. And
more permanent than May's hardline Brexit supports would accept.
    ""There are many ways to skin a cat,"" another EU diplomat
working on the Brexit conundrum said. ""But only so many -- and
we have looked at all of them. So it's either the backstop or
all of the United Kingdom staying inside our customs zone.""
    ""Now, Britain must simply pick.""

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Dubai-October 18: Fitch Ratings has revised Turkish consumer goods 
manufacturer Arcelik A.S.'s Outlook to Negative from Stable while affirming the 
Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'BB+' and 
National Long-Term Rating at 'AA+(tur)'. 

The Outlook change reflects Arcelik's continuing weak free cash flow (FCF) 
generation, which we forecast to be negative in 2018 and 2019 . Fitch expects a 
more prolonged stress on cash generation compared with Arcelik management's 
expectations, driven by higher financing costs, plus increased inventory and 
receivable collection days in the domestic market. Significant volatility in the 
Turkish economy is compounding uncertainty over free cash flow forecasts. 
However, we expect Arcelik will maintain funds from operations (FFO) adjusted 
(for receivables) net leverage below 2.5x in the medium term, in line with the 
'BBB' rating median. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

FCF Generation Remains Weak: FCF generation continues to be under stress, driven 
by increased working capital needs, higher capex , and sharp increases in 
interest rates in Turkey. Fitch believes that current FCF generation is not 
commensurate with the current ratings, and prolonged stress on cash generation 
could further increase leverage. However Fitch expects FCF generation to turn 
positive in 2020, as the expansion programme completes and inventory levels in 
factories normalise. 

Leverage Still Commensurate with Ratings: Despite significant volatility in 
working capital needs, sharp movements in currency and interest rates, Fitch 
forecasts FFO adjusted (for receivables) net leverage to average 2x until 2020, 
remaining below our negative rating sensitivity, which is comfortably in line 
with the 'BBB' rating median of 2.5x.

Fitch forecasts profitability to remain at current stressed levels until 2020, 
along with a negative FCF margin averaging 3% for the next 24 months. However, 
we expect Arcelik to maintainsome headroom under our current leverage 
sensitivity. Although leverage is currently in line with the ratings, Fitch 
highlights a significant increase in uncertainty in the domestic Turkish economy 
, and sharp FX and interest rate movements could lead to swift and material 
increases in leverage and, consequently, a downgrade.

Immaterial Currency Impact on Profitability: Compared with Turkish peers, sharp 
FX movements in 2018 have had a lower impact on Arcelik's profitability. With 
36% of revenue coming from the domestic market, Arcelik remains a significant 
Turkish exporter, with healthy hedging policies in place for hard currency 
movements. However, along with current business expansion, Arcelik is still 
highly exposed to emerging markets, such as Pakistan and Egypt where hedging 
policies are very limited, which is stressing profitability. The current 
business expansion will increase this exposure.

Fitch believes that sharp movements in other emerging market currencies could 
marginally lower profitability in the next 12-18 months. However, Fitch still 
expects the EBIT margin to remain around 7%, which is in line with current 
ratings and slightly below our 'BBB' rating median of 8%.

Revenue Growth Remains Strong: We expect Arcelik to maintain double-digit 
revenue growth throughout our four-year forecast horizon, supported by an 
expanding international presence. We expect a slowdown in domestic volumes as a 
result of challenging macroeconomic conditions in Turkey and high revenue base 
in 2017.On the international front, we expect the expanding business footprint, 
increased market share and the recent Turkish lira devaluation to drive revenue 
growth

Growing Market Shares: Arcelik has generated strong international revenue growth 
in the past few years, by attracting more price-conscious consumers in western 
Europe and by capitalising on its strong marketing and distribution 
network,which hasallowed it to become one of the top three white goods 
manufacturers in Europe. We believe Arcelik will be able to further increase its 
market shares , through its low-cost manufacturing abilities, the Turkish lira 
deprecation, strong RD and a solid product line. We expect international markets 
to be the main growth driver beyond 2017, as Arcelik has targeted markets where 
appliance penetration rates are lower than the rest of the world.

Emerging Market Exposure: We believe recent investment/expansion plans in the 
ASEAN region is a positive step towards reducing Arcelik's exposure to the 
Turkish economy, which has constrained the ratings. Arcelik has become more 
geographically diverse white goods manufacturer in the past 10 years, by gaining 
solid market shares in Europe and expanding into new emerging markets. Domestic 
revenue declined.to 36% in 1H18 from 41% in 1H17, and 50% in 2008 Nevertheless, 
Arcelik's emerging market presence is high compared with peers' like Whirlpool 
and Electrolux, and remains a credit risk.

Financial Services Adjustments: Arcelik's reported leverage is affected by 
higher-than-average working capital needs, as a significant portion of durable 
goods are sold on credit in Turkey. While this is partly financed by Arcelik, 
the dealer credit risk is covered by banks' letters of credit and mortgages. 
Fitch assumes approximately 120 days of domestic receivables come from this 
business practice in Turkey and adjusts debt accordingly to reflect a more 
accurate peer comparison. Based on its financial services criteria, Fitch 
applies a 3x debt/equity ratio for these receivables.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

Arcelik has strong market shares in Turkey and Europe, which drive stable EBITDA 
(around 10%) and FFO margins (around 8%), which are commensurate with the 'BBB' 
rating median in our capital goods navigator, and are in line with higher-rated 
peers like Whirlpool Corp. (BBB/Stable) and Panasonic Corporation (BBB/Stable). 
However, these strengths are offset by weak FCF generation, driven by intense 
capex in new markets, and structurally high working capital needs. Despite the 
current investment phase, Arcelik's leverage metric adjusted for financial 
services remains below our negative rating sensitivity and conforms to an 'A' 
rating median in our capital goods navigator.

The technological content and RD capabilities of Arcelik are broadly in line 
with that of Whirlpool, Electrolux and the broad white goods industry. However, 
Arcelik's revenue from emerging markets is much higher than higher-rated white 
goods manufacturers'.Although Arcelik is broadening its geographical 
diversification -away from Turkey - it remains vulnerable to macro-economic, 
political and FX risks in emerging markets.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:

- Double-digit revenue growth in the European markets and mid-to-low singe-digit 
revenue declines in Turkey for 2018 and 2019

- Stress on profitability to continue for the next 12-18 months

- Sizeable capex outlay in the medium term in line with expansion plans

- Effective interest rates for2018-2019 higher than four-year historical 
averages

- Dividend pay-out to remain at historical averages despite stressed cash flow 
generation

- Financial services adjustment assumes 120 days of domestic receivables 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive 
Rating Action

-  FCF generation turningpositive in the next 12-18 months., which may lead to 
the Outlook being revised to Stable

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative 
Rating Action

- Receivable-adjusted FFO net leverage ratio above 2.5x

- FFO margin below 8% 

- Consistently negative FCF

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

Low Liquidity Score: Historically Arcelik's liquidity score has been below 1x, 
driven by the use of short-term debt to finance the group's high working capital 
needs. Available cash on balance sheet at end-2Q18 was TRY2,955 million , which 
falls short of covering Arcelik's short-term debt of TRY4,413 million and 
ournegative FCF expectations of TRY1,196 million.

Fitch believes this risk is mitigated by Arcelik's comfortable uncommitted lines 
in Turkish banks, which were available even in 2008 - 2009, and continues to be 
in place despite current stress in the Turkish market. Although the liquidity 
score of below 1x is inadequate for the current rating, this risk is partly 
mitigated by customer receivables financing, which we deem as self-liquidating. 

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS 

- Fitch assumes approximately 120 days of domestic receivables come from quasi 
financing operations in Turkey and adjusts debt accordingly to reflect a more 
accurate peer comparison (TRY2 billion for end-2017).

- Fitch treats 2% of cash/revenue as restricted cash required for operational 
needs. (TRY417 million for end-2017).

- Fitch treats TRY834 million factoring receivables as debt, and adjusts its 
debt ratios accordingly.

detail, the head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker
said.
     ""The Italian Prime Minister presented the Italian situation
to us, with big talent and in a very clear way, and we did not
ask him about it because (the Commission) is currently examining
the draft budget as sent to us by the Italian authorities,""
Juncker told a news conference.
    ""We have no negative prejudice against the Italian budget,""
Juncker said.
    Italy's populist government wants to finance higher spending
and lower taxes with more borrowing and presented a draft 2019
budget to the European Commission on Monday with a deficit three
times as high as the one the EU agreed with the previous
government in Rome.
    Italy has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe and
the highest debt servicing costs and because its economy grows
slowly, officials are concerned that more debt could trigger
another debt crisis like the one set off by Greece in 2010 that
nearly destroyed the euro zone.
    ""We did not discuss the Italian draft budget in detail, that
was not the meeting to doing so, but I know from the past that
the Commission has always been accused of being too generous
when it came to Italian budgets,"" Juncker said.
    He noted that Italy has been the only euro zone country to
have used every possibility to spend more money under EU rules,
called the Stability and Growth Pact, which allowed it to spend
30 billion euros more in the last three years without sanctions.
    ""I had some colleagues (EU leaders) on the phone, they don't
want us to add flexibility to already existing flexibility and
that is not our intention,"" Juncker said.
    ""We were very kind, gentle and positive when it came to
Italy. Because Italy is Italy,"" he said, in a reference to a
similar remark he made about France when justifying the
Commission's green light for extra spending by Paris in the
past.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - When Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte spoke about Italy's new budget to fellow EU leaders at a
summit on Thursday, his Dutch and Finnish peers were among those
who urged Rome to stick to euro zone rules on spending limits,
EU officials said.
    Conte raised the subject of his government's expansive
budget, which has caused controversy in the euro zone, over
lunch, they said, and gave an explanation of its purpose. 
    During subsequent discussion around the summit table, the
officials said, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who has long
taken a firm view on applying EU budget rules, spoke to call for
countries to observe the limits.

 (Adds further May comments, other EU leaders)
    By Elizabeth Piper and Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May and other EU leaders voiced renewed confidence on Thursday
that they could secure a Brexit deal, saying they were working
hard to overcome the very same hurdles that only days ago
brought the talks to a halt.
    Less than six months before Britain quits the EU in its
biggest shift in policy for more than 40 years, the two sides
are at odds over how to deal with their only land border,
between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland.
    The problem centres on a so-called backstop - an insurance
policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the
island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions,
if a future trading relationship is not in place in time.
    To try to unlock the talks, May had earlier signalled she
would consider extending a so-called transition period ""for a
matter of months"" after Britain leaves the EU in March, a move
her critics called a betrayal but one which the bloc welcomed.
    Extending the transition period could mean that if a future
partnership is not ready, a backstop, which so far has been
unpalatable to the British side, would not have to be triggered.
But even an extension would not get rid of the EU's insistence
that such a backstop must be agreed to secure a deal.
    For now, both sides seemed to be happy to kick any solution
to that problem a little bit further down the road.
    ""We are all working, we're intensifying the work on these
issues that remain,"" May told a news conference after a two-day
summit in Brussels had ended.
    ""What I've had from leaders around the table ... since I
arrived here in Brussels yesterday is a very real sense that
people want that deal to be done.""
    ""I am confident that we can achieve that good deal.""
    
    TRANSITION
    EU leaders also voiced a new optimism after the last summit
in the Austrian city of Salzburg ended in acrimony, with May
irritated that the EU had criticised her Brexit plans in a
particularly damaging way.
    EU Council President Donald Tusk described the mood as being
much better than Salzburg. ""What I feel today is that we are
closer to the final solutions and the deal,"" he told a news
conference.
    Jean-Claude Juncker, EU Commission president, said: ""It will
be done.""
    But behind the positive noises, one side will have to
compromise to find a way to, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said, ""to square the circle"" of the Northern Irish border.
    On arriving at the second day of the summit, May said a
""further idea"" had emerged, an idea to extend the transition
phase beyond December 2020 that caused uproar among some Brexit
supporters back in Britain.
    May and a senior British government official tried to play
down the significance of the consideration of such an extension,
saying it had only ""come up in negotiations in recent days"" and
that it was one of several options to help move the talks on -
something London desperately wants to see. [nS8N1WV05Q]
    And a French official said any extension would come with
conditions attached - it would not be automatic, it would be
decided closer to the time and that it would have to be agreed
by the leaders of the 27 other EU nations, probably unanimously.
    Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar summed it up by saying big
gaps remained between the two sides. [nL8N1WY5TU]
    ""A lot of things have been agreed but there are still big
gaps both in terms of the shape of the future relationship and
also the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland and the
backstop,"" he told reporters.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 18: Fitch Ratings has taken the following 
actions on three Greek mortgage covered bonds programmes issued by National Bank 
of Greece S.A. (NBG, CCC+/C/ccc+) and Piraeus Bank S.A. (Piraeus, CCC/C/ccc):

- NBG Programme I (NBG I) affirmed at 'BB-'; Stable Outlook, off RWP

- NBG Programme II (NBG II) upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB-'; Stable Outlook, off 
RWP

- Piraeus's covered bonds upgraded to 'BB' from 'BB-'; Stable Outlook, off RWP

Fitch has reviewed the three Greek programmes following the publication of the 
asset assumptions for Greek residential mortgage loans and the refinancing 
spread levels up to the 'BBB-' Country Ceiling (see ""Fitch Ratings Updates RMBS 
Asset Assumptions for Greece"" dated 5 October 2018 and ""Fitch Ratings Lowers 
Greek Refinancing Spread Levels in Covered Bonds Criteria"" dated 8 October 2018 
at www.fitchratings.com). The programmes were originally placed on RWP after the 
upgrade of Greece and the revision of the Country Ceiling (see ""Fitch Places 
Four Greek Covered Bonds Programmes on RWP"" dated 22 August 2018 and ""Fitch 
Upgrades Greece to 'BB-' from 'B'; Outlook Stable"" dated 10 August 2018). 

The rating actions also take into account the upgrade of banks' Issuer Default 
Ratings (IDRs) into line with their respective Viability Ratings (VRs; see 
""Fitch Upgrades Greek Banks' IDRs on Lifting of Restrictions on Deposit 
Withdrawals"" dated 8 October 2018).

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The ratings of Greek covered bonds are constrained by the 25% 
overcollateralisation (OC) that Fitch relies upon. For NBG I, there is not 
sufficient protection to withstand stresses for rating scenarios higher than the 
'B' rating floor on a probability of default (PD) basis. The tested ratings on a 
PD basis for NBG II and Piraeus are above their respective rating floors and 
stand at 'BB-' and 'B' respectively.

The Outlooks for the programmes are Stable, driven by the significant buffers 
provided by uplift factors against a downgrade of the respective banks' 
Long-Term IDRs.

Fitch has assigned the full recovery uplift of three notches to NBG II and 
Piraeus: the relied-upon OC for these programmes offsets the credit loss at the 
respective covered bonds ratings. NBG I is assigned a two-notch recovery uplift 
due to the larger credit loss, also taking into account the new asset transfer 
that occurred in August 2018, which increased the portion of restructured loans 
to 24.8% from 16.3%.

The unchanged IDR uplift of two notches assigned to each programme reflects the 
covered bonds' exemption from bail-in, that the issuers' Long-Term IDRs are 
VR-driven, and Fitch's view of the low risk of under-collateralisation at the 
point of resolution. Following the issuers' IDR upgrade into line with their 
respective VRs, Fitch takes into account the IDRs as a starting point for the 
covered bond analysis. The IDR upgrade is neutral for the covered bond ratings 
as the agency used to refer to issuers' VRs.

The Payment Continuity Uplift (PCU) remains six notches for the soft-bullet 
programme (NBG I) and eight notches for the conditional pass-through (NBG II and 
Piraeus). The notches of PCU for NBG I are unused as the rating is constrained 
by the level of OC, while NBG II and Piraeus currently use two notches and one 
notch respectively. Fitch's continuity assessment also considers protection for 
interest payments of at least three months.

NBG I

The covered bonds issued under NBG I are rated 'BB-', four notches above the 
bank's Long-Term IDR of 'CCC+'. This is based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two 
notches, an unchanged PCU of six notches and a recovery uplift of two notches. 
The rating is constrained at 'BB-' as the 25% relied-upon OC is not sufficient 
to meet timely payments in rating scenarios above the 'B' covered bonds rating 
floor, but provides more protection than the unchanged 'BB-' breakeven OC of 
20.5%, derived from the 20.5% 'BB-' credit loss.

NBG II

The covered bonds issued under NBG II are rated 'BBB-', seven notches above the 
bank's Long-Term IDR of 'CCC+'. This is based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two 
notches, an unchanged PCU of eight notches and a recovery uplift of three 
notches. The 25% OC that Fitch relies upon in its analysis provides more 
protection than the 'BBB-' breakeven OC of 16.5%.

The breakeven OC is driven by the 5.5% credit loss and the 11.2% ALM loss 
component, which represents the OC needed to cover interest payments on the 
covered bonds without triggering any asset sale.

The rating is at the Country Ceiling for Greece and it is constrained by the 
relied-upon OC, which is not sufficient to withstand stresses above the current 
'BB-' tested rating on PD. 

Piraeus

Piraeus's covered bonds are rated 'BB', six notches above the bank's Long-Term 
IDR of 'CCC'. This is based on an unchanged IDR uplift of two notches, an 
unchanged PCU of eight notches and a recovery uplift of three notches. The 
rating is constrained at 'BB' as the 25% relied-upon OC is not sufficient to 
meet timely payments in rating scenarios above the 'B' tested rating on PD, but 
provides more protection than the 'BB' breakeven OC of 22.5%.

The breakeven OC is driven by the 7.8% credit loss and the 14.7% ALM loss 
component, which represents the OC needed to cover interest payments on the 
covered bonds without triggering an asset sale.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

All else being equal, the covered bonds issued by National Bank of Greece S.A. 
(NBG) under Programme I (NBG I) and Piraeus Bank S.A. could be upgraded up to 
the Country Ceiling, provided sufficient protection is available to withstand 
stresses associated to higher rating levels. 

All else being equal, the rating of the covered bonds issued by NBG under 
Programme II (NBG II) would be sensitive to a downward revision of Greece's 
Country Ceiling. 

All else being equal, the ratings of the Greek programmes would be vulnerable to 
a downgrade if the relied-upon OC falls below Fitch's breakeven OC at the 
respective covered bonds rating. The covered bonds' rating of NBG I would be 
downgraded upon the downgrade of NBG's IDR to 'CCC-' or below, while the ratings 
of the covered bonds issued by Piraeus and NBG II are not vulnerable to a 
downgrade of the respective issuers' IDRs up to 'C'.

Fitch's breakeven OC for a given covered bonds rating will be affected by, among 
other factors, the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered 
bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. 
Therefore, the breakeven OC for a covered bonds rating cannot be assumed to 
remain stable over time.

stability of derivatives markets posed by Brexit could lead to
regulatory intervention, European Commission officials said on
Thursday, dismissing warnings they could tumble off a cliff edge
if Britain leaves the bloc with no deal.
    EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said initial
findings into potential stability risks to markets around Brexit
Day next March will be published in the coming days.
    The study is being led by the Bank of England and the
European Central Bank with input from the European Commission
and Britain's finance ministry.
    Banks have called for regulators to take preventive action
to avoid disruption to insurance and derivatives contracts if
there is a no-deal Brexit.
    Britain is taking legal steps to ensure contract continuity,
but the EU has so far declined to mirror these moves.
    Dombrovskis told a Politico event that the clearing of
derivatives is one area of concern that has emerged, but the
private sector could take action to mitigate risks, such as
shifting contracts from London to the EU before March.
    Britain hopes that a transition deal can be included in a
divorce settlement, which would mean transactions between it and
the EU could continue without disruption until the end of 2020.
    Dombrovskis said he would be following up on the central
banks' initial findings to see if any regulatory action was
needed by the EU.
    ""There is no cliff edge,"" Olivier Guersent, Dombrovskis' top
civil servant added.

relations between China and the Catholic church)
    By Philip Pullella
    VATICAN CITY, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday
received an invitation to visit North Korea and the pontiff
indicated he would consider making what would be a landmark trip
to a nation known for severe restrictions on religious practice,
according to South Korean officials.
   South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed the invitation
from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the pope verbally during
a 35-minute meeting in the Vatican.
    Any visit would be the first by a pope to the reclusive
state which does not allow priests to be permanently stationed
there. There is little information on how many of its citizens
are Catholic, or how they practice their faith.
    North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion as
long as it does not undermine the state. 
    But beyond a handful of state-controlled places of worship -
including a Catholic church in the capital of Pyongyang - no
open religious activity is allowed and the authorities have
repeatedly jailed foreign missionaries.
    Kim told Moon, a Catholic, of his wish to meet the pontiff
during a meeting last month and the South Korean leader
announced before the trip that he would be relaying a message.
[nL4N1WP2AI].
    According to the president's office, Francis expressed his
strong support for efforts to bring peace to the Korean
peninsula. Moon's office quoted the pope as telling Moon: ""Do
not stop, move forward. Do not be afraid.""
    Asked if Kim should send a formal invitation, Moon's office
quoted the pope as responding to Moon: ""your message is already
sufficient but it would be good for him to send a formal
invitation.""
    ""I will definitely answer if I get the invitation, and I can
go,"" the president's office quoted the pope as saying.
    
    RECONCILIATION
    A meeting with Pope Francis would be the latest in a string
of major diplomatic meetings for Kim Jong Un this year.
    The two Koreas have held three summits this year. Kim also
held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in
Singapore in June, where the leaders promised to work toward
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
    The pope is expected to visit neighbouring Japan next year
and the proposed North Korea visit comes as China improves
relations with the Holy See.
    A deal signed in September gives the Vatican a long-sought
say in the choice of bishops in China, and for the first time,
Beijing allowed two bishops to attend a Vatican meeting, where
they invited the pope to visit China. [nL8N1WW2UP]
    A Vatican statement made no mention of the verbal invitation
from North Korea's Kim.
    It spoke only of ""the promotion of dialogue and
reconciliation between Koreans"" and ""the common commitment to
fostering all useful initiatives to overcome the tensions that
still exist in the Korean Peninsula, in order to usher in a new
season of peace and development.""
    Any trip to the North, however brief, could be contentious
for the pope, given what the United Nations says is a record of
gross and systematic human rights abuses. 
    Aides close to the pope have said he is open to taking what
they call first steps in places where the Church has been
persecuted in the hope that the situation could improve.
    Church officials estimate that North Korea had a Catholic
community of about 55,000 just before the 1950-53 Korean War.
    Religious agencies have estimated the number remaining from
the few hundreds to about 4,000.
    Priests from the South occasionally visit, usually
accompanying aid deliveries or humanitarian projects.

    ELECTIONS
    On Sunday Poland conducts local elections: Poles will vote
for city mayors, as well as city councils, among others. The
official results will be known no earlier than on Monday.
    
    PARTY POLLS
    Ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party is supported
by 34 percent of Poles, while its arch-rival centrist Civic
Platform (PO) acting in a coalition with liberal Nowoczesna
party by 24 percent, a poll quoted by Super Express tabloid
ahead of Sunday local elections showed.
    This means that PiS may not be able to take over local
governments and cement its power over the country, as it would
need to build coalitions with smaller parties not always willing
to cooperate with a party accused of breaching democracy norms.
    A poll published this week by state-funded pollster CBOS
showed that support for PiS in local elections fell within a
month by 5 percentage points to 29 percent, but the party still
led in the poll.
    Another poll presented by Gazeta Wyborcza daily regarding
support in a future parliamentary elections showed that support
for a coalition of parties led by PiS fell by 11 percentage
points within a month.

    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini said there was no government crisis after a row
broke out in the ruling coalition over a tax amnesty draft bill,
Il Messaggero said on Friday citing Salvini.
    But Salvini, who is also leader of the right-wing League
party, said the decree containing the proposal had to stay as it
was if they did not want to create a dangerous precedent.
    On Friday, the head of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement, Luigi Di Maio, said a dispute with coalition partner
the League over a tax amnesty needed to be sorted. [nL8N1WY6Z6]
    Di Maio, also deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday the
text of the amnesty had been ""manipulated"" after his party had
signed off on the measure in cabinet, raising doubts about the
stability of the coalition government.
    The populist 5-Star and League coalition took office at the
beginning of June.
    ""We will press ahead. And there is absolutely no government
crisis,"" Salvini was quoted by Il Messaggero as saying.
    Salvini said changing the text would send the message that
everything could be changed and that ""everything is a joke"".
    But he described the run-in with Di Maio as just ""a big
misunderstanding"".
    While 5 Star has always opposed amnesties, the right-wing
League, with its traditional voter-base of self-employed
businessmen, is more favourable.
    Giancarlo Giorgetti, a cabinet undersecretary and
high-ranking League official, told La Repubblica that 5 Star had
not told them or Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of their concerns
before going public. 
    ""We fully intend to press ahead with the government but if
they continue to see conspiracies at every turn we're not
there,"" Giorgetti said.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
hit four-year highs on Friday, extending their rise after the
European Union slammed Rome's draft budget, while money markets
were betting that the EU-Italy tug-of-war could force the ECB to
delay its first rate rise.
    German government bonds, seen as a safe asset in the euro
zone, rallied. But Portuguese and Spanish bonds, resilient so
far through the Italian budget debacle, also sold off, with some
analysts suggesting this was the first sign of contagion from
Italy. 
    Italy's Prime Minister defended the free-spending budget on
Thursday, brushing off criticism from Brussels as the European
Commission stepped up pressure over a draft it labelled an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules. [nL8N1WY213]    
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the
month. [nL8N1WY4UV]    
    While it is not unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of the budget, the sending of the
formal letter and the tone of the comments were particularly
strong, analysts said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid told clients. 
    ""The next week will likely see things escalate further given
these tensions, an ECB meeting where little sympathy is likely
to be given, and also the upcoming rating agency actions,"" he
added.  
    S&P Global is due to review Italy's rating next Friday,
October 26, while Moody's said it would likely complete a review
of Italy's rating at the end of October.
    A downgrade would put Italy a notch away from junk status
and the potential loss of hundreds of billions of fund flows
that go with an investment grade rating.     
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent,
the highest since February 2014. <IT10YT=RR>     
    The 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at 332 basis
points, just below a 5-1/2 year high hit on Thursday.
<DE10IT10=RR> [nL8N1WY5V7]  
    Italy's 30-year bond yield hit a 4-1/2 year high of 4.22 pct
before dropping to 4.09 percent, still up two bps on the day and
adding to a 20 bps increase over Wednesday and Thursday.
<IT30YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, euro zone money markets are starting to push back
the timing of a European Central Bank's first interest rate rise
to  October 2019.
    Having fully priced a September 2019 hike as recently as
Monday, money markets now suggest just a 75 percent chance of a
10 bps ECB rate hike in September 2019 and fully price a hike in
October <ECBWATCH>, a bet that a tussle between Italy and EU may
force the ECB to be more cautious in removing stimulus. 
    The budget wrangling has put a lid on the euro's recent
revival. The single currency on Friday fell towards a two-month
low of $1.14325 <EUR=EBS> and has weakened over one percent this
week.
    The Italian selloff drove investors into German government
bonds with yields briefly touching 0.407 percent, the lowest in
over a month. German yields are now around 16 bps below this
month's peak. <DE10YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year government bond
yields rose 3-4 basis points each to hit a fresh one-year high
of 1.77 percent and a five-month high of 2.08 percent
respectively. <ES10YT=RR>, <PT10YT=RR> 
    Commerzbank strategists flagged the rise in Spanish yields
as a sign of contagion from Italy, calling it ""textbook crisis
dynamics"" in a note.

    ""There are important themes on which we must work - first
the fight against climate change, secondly we must push for fair
and free trade, which has been cast into doubt by some in the
world,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said.
    The biennial Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) brings together
leaders from the EU, Switzerland and Norway and 21 Asian
counterparts, including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
    After a dinner on Thursday, sessions on improving
connectivity and the multilateral system and a host of bilateral
meetings will conclude on Friday with EU leaders and Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong signing an agreement eight years
in the making.
    Singapore has been made to wait. Negotiations ended in 2014,
but as protests mounted against other trade accords, such as one
planned with the United States and one struck with Canada, the
deal was sent for approval to the European Court of Justice 
    The Commission hopes the agreement, which still requires
backing by the European Parliament, will take effect next year. 
    It would likely follow a larger free trade agreement the EU
plans with Japan and would be the EU's first trade agreement
with a member of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
    The EU remains interested in a deal with ASEAN, after talks 
were shelved in 2009. In the meantime, EU negotiators have
agreed a trade accord with Vietnam, are in  negotiations with
Indonesia and have held talks with three other ASEAN members. 
    
    TRADE SANCTIONS
    However, other less harmonious issues may also surface. 
    The EU told Cambodia earlier this month that it would lose
its special access to the world's largest trading bloc and said
it was considering similar sanctions for Myanmar in a toughening
of EU policy on human rights in Southeast Asia [nL8N1WL2JW].
    Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen was in Brussels, while
Myanmar sent its minister for international cooperation.
    ""Of course we will have to bring up questions of human
rights and values in bilateral talks,"" German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said.
    The summit could also see Beijing facing pressure to combat
what Europe says is Chinese overcapacity, notably in steel.
    China, which produces and consumes half the world's steel,
has cut some 220 million tonnes of capacity since January 2016.
But the EU wants China to cut more, as well as to remove
subsidies - a policy that has seen it form an alliance with
Tokyo and Washington.
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to
discuss subsidies with Li at a lunch on Friday, diplomats said.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo
Varadkar said on Friday that a possible extension of Britain's
post-Brexit transition period would not diminish Ireland's need
for a ""backstop"" to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland.
    He also told reporters on the third day of EU summit
meetings in Brussels that it would be up to British Prime
Minister Theresa May to decide whether she had to defy
opposition from her unionist Northern Irish allies and agree to
the EU's proposed backstop, which would potentially create trade
barriers between Northern Ireland and the British mainland.
    He said it was a ""judgment call"" May would have to make but
said that without an Irish backstop, any withdrawal treaty might
not be ratified by the European Parliament. He acknowledged that
May faces a difficult domestic political situation, running a
minority government with internal divisions on the Brexit issue.
    Varadkar also renewed a warning that a return of customs
posts on his country's border with Northern Ireland could see a
return to violence in the British province: 
    ""Certainly it's something that's in the back of my mind as a
potential consequence if we get this wrong.""
    On the issue of extending Britain's transition period, he
said: ""I'm open to the idea of an extension or a longer
transition period, but that's not an alternative to a legally
binding Irish backstop. So, certainly not an alternative, it's
just something that might be part of the mix.""

    * Builds stake in LCH to more than 80 percent
    * Plays down threat of losing business over Brexit 

    By Arathy S Nair and Huw Jones
    Oct 19 (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange <LSE.L>
tightened its grip on derivatives clearing on Friday in a sign
of growing confidence that the threat of losing chunks of
business to European Union rivals after Brexit was receding.
    In the first major move by the exchange's new chief
executive David Schwimmer, the former Goldman Sachs banker who
took the reins in August, the LSE said it was spending 438
million euros ($501 million) on increasing its stake in LCH by
15.1 percent to over 80 percent.
    The transaction, which will be funded from cash and existing
debt facilities, will add to earnings per share following
completion, expected before the end of 2018, LSE said. 
    ""This reflects our confidence in LCH for continued growth,""
the exchange's chief financial officer, David Warren told an
analyst conference call.
    LSE shares were up 0.9 percent at 4,324 pence at 0900 GMT,
bucking a weaker trend in the broader stock market.
    LCH is one of the world's top clearing houses for
derivatives, but its dominance in euro denominated transactions
has led to calls for that activity to be relocated to the single
currency area after Brexit.
    LCH also faces the threat of being locked out of the EU
market when Britain leaves the bloc next March if a no-deal
Brexit puts the legality of cross-border derivatives contracts
into question.
    Warren, however, said he was encouraged by recent meetings
with regulators and central bankers who are looking at potential
disruption to so-called contract continuity.
    ""We think there is a new urgency about getting solutions and
legal certainty in the very near future, and it's very clear our
customers want continuity of service,"" he said.
    A working group lead by the European Central Bank and Bank
of England on market risks from Brexit is due to report its
initial findings in coming days. [nL8N1WY722]
    
    EUROPEAN OPERATIONS
    The LSE has a clearing unit in Paris, but Warren said
customers don't want the exchange to apply for a licence there
to handle the euro clearing currently being done in London.
    LCH would need to serve notice on EU customers by December
if it felt it could not continue clearing their transactions in
London after Brexit, but exchange officials said on Friday they
have no plans to do this in a further sign that the threat of
disruption has receded.
    Rival Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> in Frankfurt is stepping up
efforts to attract LCH business from London but volume so far is
small.
    Warren played down the threat, saying euro-denominated
business transacted by EU customers accounted for just 7-14
percent of LCH overall activity.
    Nevertheless, the LSE, which also owns the Milan Exchange,
has applied for a licence in Amsterdam to operate its Turquoise
pan-European share trading service.
    The LSE said that total income from continuing operations
rose 8 percent to 522 million pounds in the quarter ended Sept.
30, below analysts' estimates of 530 million pounds.
    Warren said an accounting rule change dampened revenue and
income figures in the exchange's capital markets unit.

    By Stephen Jewkes
    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo
Salvini said on Friday he will halt an election tour in the
north of Italy and return to Rome to settle a row within the
government over a tax amnesty as financial markets sold off
Italian assets.
    ""Today I'm in Trentino but tomorrow I'll fly to Rome to
solve the problems. No more arguing,"" Salvini, who is also
leader of the ruling League party that governs with the 5-Star
Movement, said in a statement.
    On Wednesday, Luigi Di Maio, head of the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement, said the text of the amnesty had been
""manipulated"" after his party had signed off on the measure in
cabinet, raising doubts about the stability of the coalition
government that took office in June.
    While 5-Star has opposed amnesties in the past, the
right-wing League, with its traditional voter-base of
self-employed businessmen, is more favourable.
    The cabinet this week signed off on an expansionary 2019
budget, boosting welfare spending, cutting the retirement age
and hiking the deficit to set up a showdown with authorities in
Brussels over compliance with EU rules.
    Key policies for next year will be funded by the tax
amnesty, which includes several schemes to allow people to
settle disputes with the authorities by paying a limited sum.
The amnesties are targeted to raise about 8 billion euros.
    The main scheme involved people who have failed to declare
up to 100,000 euros of earnings during the last five years, on
which they will be able to pay a rate of 20 percent.
    The spat broke out because it emerged that in the final
draft to be sent to parliament the 100,000 euros referred to
each of a series of taxes evaded, rather than to the overall
total. 5-Star said this was unacceptable and it had been
tricked.
    The political turbulence comes on top of a dispute with the
European Commission over the budget which is alarming markets.
    The spread between yields on Italian benchmark government
bonds and the German equivalent widened on Friday to a
5-and-a-half-year high of 337 basis points and Italian bank
shares plunged. [nL8N1WZ16J]
    In the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to
Brussels rejecting the budget and to fines against Italy, the
Commission sent Rome a warning letter on Thursday.
    The document said the budget appeared to be in ""particularly
serious non-compliance"" with EU rules and its deviation from
targets was ""unprecedented"". It gave Rome until Oct. 22 to
respond.
    Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, who handed the
letter to Italy's Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, is due to hold
a news conference in Rome on Friday at 1330 GMT.
    Salvini played down the internal government rift in an
interview with Il Messaggero daily on Friday, saying: ""There is
absolutely no government crisis"".
    But Giancarlo Giorgetti, a cabinet undersecretary and
high-ranking League official warned 5-Star not to ""continue to
see conspiracies at every turn.""

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Central European government
bond yields rose on Friday as  Italy's dispute with the European
Union over its increased budget deficit targets fuelled a rise
in euro zone yields.
    Italian bond yields hit four-year highs after the EU slammed
Rome's draft budget. Investors bought safe German Bunds instead
of bonds in the euro zone, with which Central European economies
are tightly integrated.
    A drop in regional equities prices also reflected risk
aversion, with worries over China's economic slowdown weighing
on nerves despite some rebound in regional currencies.
    Citi Group recommended that investors should underweight
Hungarian bonds because they are vulnerable to yield rises in
the United States and Italy.
    ""For EM (emerging markets) a lot is riding on whether the
China stimulus is sufficient,"" Citi analysts said.
    Hungarian bond yields rose 304 basis points along the curve,
with 10-year papers trading at 3.8 percent.
    ""This is partly Italy, and also positions are rearranged
ahead of the long week-end (due to Hungary's Oct. 23 national
holiday),"" one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.
    ""But Polish yields are also up, even though they do not even
have a long week-end,"" the trader added.
    Poland's 10-year yield rose 8 basis points to 3.28 percent,
even though the corresponding Bund yield which it often tracks
was lower by 1 basis point at 0.41 percent. 
    Polish yields rose, and along with other Central European
units, they firmed slightly, tracking a mild rebound in the MSCI
emerging market currency index <.MIEM00000CUS>, even though
Poland released weaker-than-expected retail sale growth data.
    The September figures showed a drop in the annual growth
rate to 5.6 percent from 9 percent in August.
    ""(That) is another disappointment this week after weaker
than expected growth of industry and somewhat disappointing
labor market data,"" Erste analyst Katarzyna Rzentarzewska said.
    ""Such development fits into the picture of upcoming
moderation of growth confirming that economy reached the peak in
1H18,"" she added.
    Dovish Polish rate setter Jerzy Zyzynski was quoted by the
PAP news agency on Thursday as saying that high real interest
rates may even point towards cutting rather than increasing
Polish central bank interest rates.
    Poland will hold the first round of local elections on
Sunday, and the fight for big cities including Warsaw is a key
test to the ruling nationalist PiS party's support ahead of
European Parliament and national elections next year.
[L4N1WB3EC]
    The results of the vote are unlikely to affect markets
seriously, senior economist of Credit Agricole in Poland,
Krystian Jaworski said.
    ""Unless we see a drastic discrepancy compared to the polls,
which may somehow shift the market perception regarding the
results of the parliamentary (elections),"" he added.
    According to an opinion poll quoted by the tabloid Super
Express, PiS is supported by 34 percent of Poles, while its
arch-rival centrist Civic Platform (PO) acting in a coalition
with liberal Nowoczesna party had 24 percent support.

    * Bond yields rise as Italy clashes with EU over budget
    * Risks including China's economic slowdown weigh on
equities
    * Polish retail sales lose pace, pointing to economic
slowdown

    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Central European government
bond yields rose on Friday as  Italy's dispute with the European
Union over its increased budget deficit targets fuelled a rise
in euro zone yields.
    Italian bond yields hit four-year highs after the EU slammed
Rome's draft budget. Investors bought safe German Bunds instead
of bonds in the euro zone, with which Central European economies
are tightly integrated.
    A drop in regional equities prices also reflected risk
aversion, with worries over China's economic slowdown weighing
on nerves despite some rebound in regional currencies.
    Citi Group recommended that investors should underweight
Hungarian bonds because they are vulnerable to yield rises in
the United States and Italy.
    ""For EM (emerging markets) a lot is riding on whether the
China stimulus is sufficient,"" Citi analysts said.
    Hungarian bond yields rose 3-4 basis points along the curve,
with 10-year papers trading at 3.8 percent.
    ""This is partly Italy, and also positions are rearranged
ahead of the long week-end (due to Hungary's Oct. 23 national
holiday),"" one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.
    ""But Polish yields are also up, even though they do not even
have a long week-end,"" the trader added.
    Poland's 10-year yield rose 8 basis points to 3.28 percent,
even though the corresponding Bund yield which it often tracks
was lower by 1 basis point at 0.41 percent. 
    Polish yields rose, and along with other Central European
units, the zloty firmed slightly, tracking a mild rebound in the
MSCI emerging market currency index <.MIEM00000CUS>, even though
Poland released weaker-than-expected retail sale growth data.
    The September figures showed a drop in the annual growth
rate to 5.6 percent from 9 percent in August.
    ""(That) is another disappointment this week after weaker
than expected growth of industry and somewhat disappointing
labor market data,"" Erste analyst Katarzyna Rzentarzewska said.
    ""Such development fits into the picture of upcoming
moderation of growth confirming that economy reached the peak in
1H18,"" she added.
    Dovish Polish rate setter Jerzy Zyzynski was quoted by the
PAP news agency on Thursday as saying that high real interest
rates may even point towards cutting rather than increasing
Polish central bank interest rates.
    Poland will hold the first round of local elections on
Sunday, and the fight for big cities including Warsaw is a key
test to the ruling nationalist PiS party's support ahead of
European Parliament and national elections next year.
[L4N1WB3EC]
    The results of the vote are unlikely to affect markets
seriously, senior economist of Credit Agricole in Poland,
Krystian Jaworski said.
    ""Unless we see a drastic discrepancy compared to the polls,
which may somehow shift the market perception regarding the
results of the parliamentary (elections),"" he added.
    According to an opinion poll quoted by the tabloid Super
Express, PiS is supported by 34 percent of Poles, while its
arch-rival centrist Civic Platform (PO) acting in a coalition
with liberal Nowoczesna party had 24 percent support.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
hit 4 1/2-year highs on Friday  after the European Union slammed
Rome's draft budget, while money markets bet that the EU-Italy
tug-of-war could force the European Central Bank to delay its
first rate rise.
    German government bonds, considered a safe asset in the euro
zone, rallied. But Portuguese and Spanish bonds, resilient so
far through the Italian budget debacle, sold off, with some
analysts suggesting this was the first sign of contagion from
Italy. 
    Italy's Prime Minister defended the free-spending budget on
Thursday, brushing off criticism from Brussels as the European
Commission stepped up pressure over a draft it labelled an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules [nL8N1WY213].    
    EU authorities will send a formal warning letter that could
lead to Brussels rejecting the draft before the end of the month
[nL8N1WY4UV].    
    While it is not unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of the budget, a formal letter and
the tone of the comments were particularly strong, analysts
said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid told clients. 
    ""The next week will likely see things escalate further given
these tensions, an ECB meeting where little sympathy is likely
to be given, and also the upcoming rating agency actions,"" he
added.  
    S&P Global is due to review Italy's rating next Friday,
October 26 and Moody's is expected to complete a review of
Italy's rating by the end of October.
    A downgrade would put Italy a notch away from junk status
and the potential loss of hundreds of billions of funds that go
with an investment grade rating [nL8N1WP4QO].
    Reports of a disagreement within the Italian coalition also
hurt the country's bond market. Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would halt an electoral tour in
northern Italy and return to Rome to settle a row within the
government over a tax amnesty [nR1N1W5003].
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose nearly 10 basis
points to 3.77 percent, the highest since February 2014, while
two-year yields were up 11 bps at 1.93 percent. <IT10YT=RR>     
    The 10-year bond yield spread over Germany was at 338 bps, a
fresh 5-1/2 year high. <DE10IT10=RR>     
    Italy's 30-year bond yield hit a 4 1/2-year high of 4.22 pct
before dropping to 4.12 percent, still up five bps on the day
and adding to a 20-bps increase over Wednesday and Thursday.
<IT30YT=RR> 
    Meanwhile, trade in euro zone money markets suggested
investors were starting to push back expectations for the timing
of an ECB rate rise to October 2019.
    Having fully priced in a September 2019 hike as recently as
Monday, money markets now suggest just a 75 percent chance of a
10 bps rise then <ECBWATCH>, a sign that turmoil in Italy is
forcing a more cautious stance from the ECB.
    The budget wrangling has put a lid on the euro's recent
revival. The single currency on Friday fell towards a two-month
low of $1.14325 <EUR=EBS> and has weakened over one percent this
week.
    But safe-haven German government bonds gained, with 10-year
yields touching a one-month low of 0.39 percent and two-year
yields a two-month low of minus 0.67 percent. German yields are
now around 16 bps below this month's peak. <DE10YT=RR>
<DE2YT=RR>         
    Spanish and Portuguese 10-year government bond yields rose 7
to 8 basis points each to a one-year high of 1.82 percent and a
five-month high of 2.11 percent respectively. <ES10YT=RR>,
<PT10YT=RR> 
    Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger flagged the rise in
Spanish yields as a sign of contagion from Italy, though he said
issues around the Spanish budget also contributed [nL8N1WR24E].

levels high
    * Connects directly with anti-immigrant, populist message
    * Media team can work 24 hours a day, aims to posts every 2
hours
    * Operation is ""state of the art"", Steve Bannon says

    By Steve Scherer
    TURIN, Italy, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime
Minister Matteo Salvini has doubled support for his far-right
party in just seven months by cultivating a savvy social media
presence that any politician would envy - including his
inspiration, Donald Trump.
    Salvini, who modelled his ""Italians first"" campaign after
Trump's successful U.S. presidential bid, has built an effective
communications machine aimed not just at bolstering his League
party's popularity at home but also helping anti-immigrant,
populist forces win control of European parliament next May.
    Salvini has been especially successful on Facebook, Italy's
most popular platform with 34 million active users per month out
of an eligible voting population of 46.6 million.
    Although Trump's page has more ""likes"" at 23.5 million
versus Salvini's 3.2 million, the Italian's followers are more
""engaged"", according to data compiled by Pietro Raffa, a digital
strategist for Milan communications consultancy MR & Associati. 
    In the first week of July, for example, 2.6 million people
liked, commented, shared or watched videos on Salvini's 82
Facebook posts, versus 1.5 million engagements on 32 posts for
Trump, Raffa's data showed.
    ""Salvini always has much more engagement than Trump,"" Luca
Morisi, Salvini's social media strategist and the man behind the
machine, said at a workshop hosted by pollster and political
analysis firm YouTrend in early October.
    Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Reuters that U.S.
politicians could learn a lot from Salvini's methods.
    ""The use of social media and Facebook Live... were state of
the art,"" said Bannon, who has met Salvini more than once. ""I
was blown away by how sophisticated he was and how he managed to
do it on a shoestring.""
    Much of the credit goes to Morisi, 45, who developed
software for financial institutions before joining Salvini. His
team of 10 works 24 hours a day if necessary, averaging 10
Facebook posts a day and spreading content across YouTube,
Twitter and Instagram, and through Whatsapp and Telegram chat
groups.
    Using a specially designed matrix of software, collectively
dubbed ""the Beast"", the team creates graphics, pumps out adverts
for upcoming events, publishes on multiple social media
platforms, and monitors news.
    A loyal and growing cohort of ""real people"" churn out social
media support for Salvini voluntarily, Morisi said in his
presentation, titled ""The Legend of the Captain"", a ubiquitous
nickname for Salvini that Morisi coined.
    ""There's a community that was built up over time, piece by
piece, brick by brick, that today is very strong,"" he told the
workshop for aspiring political communications professionals. 
    Morisi avoids the limelight and rarely speaks to the media.
A Reuters reporter was allowed to attend his closed-door talk
and take part in a question-and-answer session afterwards - the
only reporter there - but Morisi declined to be interviewed
separately. 
   
    THE BRAND
    The machine started up in earnest in January 2014, less than
a month after Salvini took the reins of a party polling around 3
percent and plagued by corruption scandals, Morisi said.
    Morisi set aside party references and made Salvini - a
folksy, 45-year-old politician with a reputation for plain
speaking - the brand.
    Now the League polls as high as 34 percent, better than its
5-Star Movement coalition partner. In September, Salvini's
Facebook page had 28 million unique views, and Morisi said it
has recently reached as high as 30 million.
    Like Trump, Salvini doesn't shy away from controversy that
sparks debate and more traffic. ""The more they call us racists,
the closer we get to 51 percent,"" he said in a Facebook video on
Sept. 25.
    ""The secret of Salvini's communication is Salvini himself,
together with a team of people who have worked with him for a
long time, which plans and amplifies the message,"" Morisi said.
    Chubby and bearded, Salvini invites people into his world,
posting pictures of the reality TV show he's watching -
""Temptation Island VIP"", for example - or, at 11:30 p.m., the
chestnuts he's roasted as a snack.  
    ""How much I like chestnuts!!!"", he wrote on Oct. 3. ""Have a
nice evening friends. You can count on me."" 
    ""These posts are very important because they create a direct
relationship with people, and they help distinguish Salvini from
the unpopular caste of politicians,"" Morisi said.
    The personal posts are mixed in with automated plugs for his
radio or TV appearances, or with news. Then there are the
Facebook Live videos, including one from the roof of parliament
- ""the only place in the building where we could find a 4G
connection,"" Morisi said - where Salvini attacked the
""eurocrats"" in Brussels.
    Together with France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen,
Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban and others,
Salvini aims to overthrow the European Union's liberal
establishment and restore power to nation states, an agenda many
see as a threat to European unity.
    When he was placed under investigation for kidnapping after
refusing to allow migrants to disembark from an Italian coast
guard ship, Salvini went live on Facebook from his interior
ministry office to open the court order.
    Where other Italian politicians might squirm with
embarrassment, Salvini acted like the investigation was a medal
of honour, with his audience as happy accomplices. 
    ""It is you who asked this minister to control the borders,
to control the ports, to limit arrivals, to limit the departure
of illegal migrants,"" he told his viewers.    
    
    SOUFFLE
    To keep people's attention on the Internet, you need graphic
variety - different type cases, emoticons and bullets in text -
consistency of narrative voice, accuracy in spelling and
grammar, brevity and speed, Morisi said.
    ""One day on social media is like a week in the pre-social
media era,"" he said. He aims to publish a post every two hours
to announce that ""the bar is open"". 
    ""If you leave a page even only a few hours without new
content, it sags like a souffle,"" he said.
    To amplify Salvini's message before the March general
election, Morisi created a contest: the fastest person to ""like""
Salvini's posts each day would get their picture on his page.
The top four clickers during the three-week game won a coffee
and a selfie with their ""captain"". Some 50,000 people signed up.
    Any spike in numbers is amplified by Facebook's algorithm,
he said.
    Morisi denied reports by La Stampa newspaper and others that
the ""Beast"" software picks up on the mood of the online audience
at any given moment to hone Salvini's message.
    ""There's no algorithm that suggests to us or to Salvini what
should be talked about,"" he said. ""An expert communicator with
years and years of experience doesn't need an algorithm that
tells him to take a picture of chestnuts.""

 (Updates with latest draft statement)
    By Philip Blenkinsop and Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The European Union was set to
sign a trade deal with Singapore on Friday after talks with
Asian leaders keen to push back against U.S. protectionism, but
efforts to encourage China to drop state subsidies ran into
resistance from Beijing.
    The biennial Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) brings together
leaders representing 65 percent of global economic output --
from the EU, Switzerland, Norway and 21 Asian countries,
including Russia and China.
    The EU hoped to use the gathering to show the world it can
move beyond Britain's departure from the bloc.
    However, a final summit communique was set to omit a call
for an end to government trade distortions, according to the
latest draft and EU diplomats.
    China requested the changes at a negotiation of senior EU
and Asian officials overnight, two diplomats said. The statement
will instead commit to ""free and open trade on a level playing
field"" and to fighting ""all forms of protectionism"", in an
indirect reference to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports.
    The earlier draft, seen by Reuters, had called for ""the
elimination of unjustifiable market distorting measures by
governments"".
    
    SUBSIDIES
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was due to
discuss subsidies with Li at lunch, diplomats said.
    The European Union and the United States accuse China of
directly funding state companies through Chinese banks to help
them to dominate global markets, breaking rules set down by the
World Trade Organization, of which China is a member.
    The EU also wants China, which produces and consumes half
the world's steel and has cut some 220 million tonnes of
manufacturing overcapacity since January 2016, to reduce its
capacity further.
    After sessions on improving connectivity and the
multilateral system and a host of bilateral meetings, the summit
was due to finish on Friday with the EU signing an agreement
with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
    That pact has been eight years in the making. Negotiations
ended in 2014, but as protests mounted against other trade
accords, such as one planned with the United States and one
struck with Canada, the deal was sent for approval to the
European Court of Justice 
    The Commission hopes the agreement, which still needs the
backing of the European Parliament, will take effect next year. 
    
    VIETNAM, INDONESIA
    It would likely follow a larger free trade agreement that
the EU plans with Japan, and would be the EU's first trade
agreement with a member of the 10-country Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
    The EU remains interested in a deal with ASEAN, after talks
were shelved in 2009. In the meantime, EU negotiators have
agreed a trade accord with Vietnam, are in negotiations with
Indonesia and have held talks with three other ASEAN members. 
    However, other less harmonious issues may also surface. 
    The EU told Cambodia this month that it would lose its
special access to the world's largest trading bloc and said it
was considering similar sanctions for Myanmar in a toughening of
policy on human rights in Southeast Asia. [nL8N1WL2JW]
    Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen was in Brussels, while
Myanmar sent its minister for international cooperation. 
    The summit statement will call for an end to the Rohingya
crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.
    ""Of course we will have to bring up questions of human
rights and values in bilateral talks,"" German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said.

turmoil in Italy will force a more cautious stance from the ECB.

    But safe-haven German government bonds gained, with 10-year
yields touching a one-month low of 0.39 percent and two-year
yields a two-month low of minus 0.67 percent. German yields are
now around 16 bps below this month's peak. <DE10YT=RR>

    Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger flagged the rise in
Spanish yields as a sign of contagion from Italy, though he said
issues around the Spanish budget also contributed [nL8N1WR24E].

    BERLIN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf
Scholz is working with international counterparts on a global
minimum corporate tax, a ministry spokesman said on Friday, as
governments look to prevent companies from shopping around for
tax havens.
    A crackdown by the European Commission on deals between
individual EU governments and multinationals has resulted in
Apple <AAPL.O>, Starbucks <SBUX.O> and Fiat <FCHA.MI> paying
billions of euros in back taxes. 
    ""The goal is to prevent unfair tax competition,"" the
spokesman said. ""The German government is convinced that big,
digital and border-crossing companies must do their part to
finance the common good.""
    Conceptual work on the proposal is still under way and
consultations are still at an early stage, the spokesman said.
    Germany is working closely with France on the plan, German
newspaper Handelsblatt reported, adding that Scholz has asked
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD)
to consider the proposal.
    The proposal would be an extension of BEPS, a set of OECD
policies to tackle tax avoidance strategies that allow
multinational companies to shift profits artificially to low or
no-tax locations.
    Handelsblatt quoted an OECD official as saying the proposal
had been well received but that talks remained at an early
stage. ""In the context of the BEPS discussion, France and
Germany have proposed discussing a minimum tax and making it the
standard,"" OECD tax lead Pascal Saint-Amans was quoted as
saying.
    The goal is not to force countries to potentially raise
their tax levels, but to give them a way to ensure that
companies did not skip paying taxes at all.

    By Inti Landauro
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The global watchdog for
money-laundering regulation said on Friday it will set up its
first rules by June on how countries should oversee
cryptocurrencies.
    The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said
jurisdictions across the world will be required to license or
regulate exchanges and some firms providing cryptocurrency
wallets, in a bid to stamp out the use of digital money for
money laundering, terrorism financing or other crime.
    Firms providing financial services for issuances of new
cryptocurrencies - initial coin offerings - must also be subject
to the rules, it said.
    The FATF move represents a landmark moment for
cryptocurrency regulation - something that, until now, has
defied global coordination and led to a patchwork of differing
approaches by national governments. 
    Countries that fail to set up the required rules would be
added to the FATF blacklist, which restricts access to the
global financial system by jurisdictions found not do enough to
prevent financial crime, said President Marshall Billingslea.
    ""By June, we will issue additional instructions on the
standards and how we expect them to be enforced,"" he said.
    Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens whose creators say they
can be used as money without the backing of any country's
central bank. The first and most popular is bitcoin, which has
been followed by hundreds of others issued around the world.

percent in the third quarter of this year from the previous
three months as industrial output stagnated, the Bank of Italy
estimated on Friday.
    Recent data has pointed to slowing activity in the euro
zone's third largest economy, and this month the government
revised down the official estimate for 2018 growth to 1.2
percent from a 1.5 percent projection made in April.
    The faltering economy was one reason given by the ruling
coalition for presenting an expansionary 2019 budget that has
riled the European Commission, which says it will push up
Italy's mammoth public debt.
    ""The available cyclical indicators suggest that in the third
quarter, gross domestic product growth slowed to about 0.1
percent compared with the previous quarter,"" the Bank of Italy
said in its quarterly economic bulletin.
    Italy posted growth of 0.2 percent in the second quarter,
and a 0.1 percent rate in the third would be the slowest since
the second quarter of 2016.
    Italy has been under financial market pressure since the new
government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
right-wing League took office in June, and a sell-off of
government bonds has accelerated in the last few days.
    The Bank of Italy said foreign investors reduced their
holdings of Italian securities by 42.8 billion euros in the
first eight months of this year, disposing of 24.9 billion euros
of government bonds and 12.4 billion euros of bank bonds.
    Despite the financial market tensions, bank lending to firms
and households is ""rising moderately, supported by a small
expansion in demand,"" the bulletin said.
    In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of new
non-performing loans to outstanding loans fell to 1.5 percent on
a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, the central bank said.
    The ratio was 1.7 percent in the first quarter.

    By Leigh Thomas
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - While France has experienced
political turbulence and disappointing economic data in recent
months, beneath the surface are signs of deeper change that
suggest President Emmanuel Macron's reform drive is starting to
bear fruit.
    For much of this year, the 40-year-old president and former
investment banker has had to endure less-than-thrilling news on
the economic front, with consumer and business confidence
wilting and the growth outlook souring.
    But looking past those lacklustre short-term indicators,
employment and new business creations are at record levels and a
purchasing power boost is around the bend.
    Together, they are evidence of more meaningful, structural
economic changes afoot that might one day, albeit not yet, help
to stem a long-term decline in France's export competitiveness.
    ""There are some shifts that are starting to crop up,"" said
economist Denis Ferrand, managing director of the Rexecode think
tank, pointing in particular to a surge in the employment rate.
    At nearly 66 percent, the proportion of people in work has
reached the highest level in records going back to late 2003,
which Ferrand said was an indication the economy's growth
potential was shifting up a gear.
    While Rexecode's growth forecast of 1.3 percent next year is
lower than the government's estimate of 1.7 percent, Ferrand's
colleagues believe that, over time, Macron's reforms will add
0.2-0.3 percentage points to annual growth.
    
    VOTERS FRUSTRATED
    Macron has promised pro-business reforms that boost
investment and jobs. But voters have grown restless in the face
of such slow growth.
    His sometimes brash leadership style, and the desertion of
several key ministers that triggered a messy reshuffle this
week, have only added to their sense of frustration.
    Yet despite such headline-grabbing setbacks, the labour
market appears to be growing stronger, even though the
unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 8.7 percent.
    People are not only getting jobs but also increasingly
signing long-term contracts, once shunned by employers who
feared they would not be able to lay workers off if business
declined.
    An overhaul of the labour code last year sought to address
such worries by making it easier to both hire and fire.
    ""You can say what you want, but when you look at what he's
done in the last 18 months, he's been very active ... He went
after big issues, like the labour market,"" said economist
Jean-Herve Lorenzi, who runs the Cercle des Economistes forum.
    Strikingly, the youth unemployment rate is dropping, despite
the fact Macron's government is slashing the number of
subsidised jobs that tended to benefit young people in the past.
    Though still high, at over 20 percent, the rate is now the
lowest since late 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.
    
    NEW BUSINESSES BOOMING
    Macron has also cut taxes on companies and capital in a move
to boost investment, innovation and risk-taking.
    Right on cue, new business creations promptly soared, and
they show no signs of slowing despite the weaker economic
outlook. A record 59,700 new businesses were set up in
September, according to the INSEE official statistics agency.
    Lorenzi cautioned, however, that ""start-ups and industrial
innovation can't make up the economy as a whole"".
    While companies and the wealthy got a tax cut, many voters
feel left out, especially as they suffered social security and
petrol tax hikes at the start of the year. An inflation surge
further squeezed their finances.
    To counter accusations of ruling for the rich, Macron's
government is now focused on boosting household purchasing
power, always an issue in France's consumer-driven economy.
[nL8N1W33GI]    
    INSEE says a cut in payroll tax this month and a cut in
municipal tax next month should boost disposable income 1.7
percent in the last three months of the year, the strongest
quarterly increase in 16 years.
    But it remains clear that France still has a long way to go.
Its share of exports from the euro zone to the world has
stagnated at 12 percent, suggesting that Macron has made little
progress in reversing its long-term competitive decline. 
    ""The day we stabilise or even win back market share will be
a sign of real structural change,"" said Ferrand. ""But that's a
structural indicator that has yet to show up.""

    MADRID, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Shares in Spanish banks rebounded
on Friday after the Supreme Court said it would review the
impact of a ruling on mortgage stamp duty after initially saying
on Thursday that banks would have to pay the tax.
    The court said that, as the ruling was a ""radical change"" in
its criteria and had an ""enormous economic and social impact"", a
senior judge agreed to suspend all pending appeals on the
matter.
    The Supreme Court ruling had unexpectedly overturned a
previous ruling from earlier this year and though it was final
it didn't state from when clients were entitled to be
compensated.
    Now the Court has to say if this new ruling would set a
judicial precedent on future rulings.
    The Spanish legal system allows customers to potentially
reclaim any compensation from tax authorities for cases going
back four years.
    Shares in all Spanish banks had suffered big declines on the
ruling on Thursday as that could leave banks potentially exposed
to additional billions of euros in legal provisions.
    On Friday, Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Bankia <BKIA.MC>,
which fell 6 percent and 4 percent, reversed losses.

 (Recasts with Polish bond yield increase, new comments)
    By Sandor Peto
    BUDAPEST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Poland led a rise in Central
European government bond yields on Friday as Italy's dispute
with the European Union over its plan for higher budget deficits
also boosted debt yields in the euro zone, with which the
region's economies are tightly integrated. 
    Italian bond yields hit four-year highs after the EU
crticised Rome's draft budget. 
    A 6 basis point rise in Poland's 10-year yield <PL10YT=RR>
to 3.27 percent erased all the price gains the bonds posted
since Standard & Poor's improved the country's rating to 'A-"" a
week ago.
    The upgrade brought the rating level back to where it was
before a shock downgrade in early 2016 due to the initial
measures of the government led by the conservative PiS party.
    S&P cited the robustly growing Polish economy, but its move
surprised some investors who had believed that Warsaw's dispute 
with the European Commission over the rule of law in Poland
would block an upgrade. [nL8N1WS5SZ]

ahead of the long week-end (due to Hungary's Oct. 23 national
holiday),"" one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.
    Polish bonds underperformed Hungarian peers which got a bad
beating from a sell-off in emerging markets earlier this month
when the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield surged to 7-year highs.
    ""(Friday's Polish yield rise) looks like a delayed reaction
on global factors, including Italy, of course,"" Bank Pekao
analyst Arkadiusz Urbanski said. 
    ""(Polish bonds) remained stable, when core markets
weakened,"" he said, adding that fresh supply at a Polish bond
auction next week would arrive in an uncertain international
environment. 
    Citi Group recommended that investors should underweight
Hungarian bonds because they are vulnerable to yield rises in
the United States and Italy.
    ""For EM (emerging markets) a lot is riding on whether the
China (economic) stimulus is sufficient,"" Citi analysts said.
    In Poland, September data showed a drop in the annual growth
in retail sales rate to 5.6 percent from 9 percent in August.
    The figures confirmed that the economy is slowing, and
underpinned expectations that the Polish central bank would keep
interest rates at record lows in the coming quarters.
    Poland will hold the first round of local elections on
Sunday. The fight for big cities including Warsaw is a key test
to the ruling nationalist PiS party's support ahead of European
Parliament and national elections next year. [L4N1WB3EC]
    The results are unlikely to affect markets seriously, senior
economist of Credit Agricole in Poland, Warsaw-based analysts
including Credit Agricole's Krystian Jaworski said.
    ""However, shall the voting reveal that there could be no
clear winner of the 2019 parliamentary elections, the market
could start pricing the political risk,"" said Marcin Sulewski,
economist of Santander bank.

5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio had taken the minutes when the
amnesty was decided at a government meeting earlier this week.

 (Updates with bilaterals with Li, comments from France and
Medvedev)
    By Philip Blenkinsop and Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European governments pressed
China on Friday to allow greater foreign investment in its
economy, using a two-day summit with Asian leaders to push back
against U.S. protectionism but facing familiar resistance from
Beijing over state subsidies.
    At a biennial Asia-Europe Meeting bringing together leaders
representing 65 percent of global economic output, France,
Britain, Germany, Italy and the European Commission held private
meetings with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, hoping for greater
access for EU companies to the world's No. 2 economy.
    Li told British Prime Minister Theresa May that he ""looked
forward to ushering in a diamond era"" after their bilateral
meeting, a British government statement said.
    In a sign of China's outsized role, Li led the pack of
European and Asian leaders along the summit red carpet and stood
in the centre of the 50 other leaders for a photo, alongside
Merkel and the summit chair, European Council President Donald
Tusk. 
    China has been promising for years to ease restrictions on
foreign investment, but Western governments say little has
changed and many are worried that Beijing is heading towards
more state control under President Xi Jinping.
    China restricts foreign investment more than the EU in every
sector except real estate, according to a report by the Rhodium
Group consultancy.
    French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with Li on
Thursday evening, lobbying for better access to China's poultry,
dairy, pharmaceuticals, services and financial services sectors,
a French official said. 
    But there was no sign of a breakthrough. ""Some gestures have
been made, but it must go further now,"" the official said.
    
    SYMPATHY OVER TARIFFS
    China did appear to win some sympathy for U.S. President
Donald Trump's tariffs on billions of dollars of its exports. 
    Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, visiting Brussels on
official business for the first time since Moscow annexed Crimea
in 2014, told his counterparts: ""At this table, there are the
leaders of countries that have experienced the signs of those
trade wars in full. And it is, probably, the saddest thing that
is happening now.""
    A final summit communique was set to omit a call for an end
to government trade distortions, according to the latest draft
and EU diplomats.
    China requested the changes at talks between senior EU and
Asian officials overnight, two diplomats said. The statement
will instead commit to ""free and open trade on a level playing
field"" and to fighting ""all forms of protectionism"", in an
indirect reference to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports.
    The earlier draft, seen by Reuters, had called for ""the
elimination of unjustifiable market distorting measures by
governments"".
    The European Union and the United States accuse China of
directly funding state companies through Chinese banks to help
them to dominate global markets, breaking rules set down by the
World Trade Organization, of which China is a member.
    The EU also wants China, which produces and consumes half
the world's steel and has cut some 220 million tonnes of
manufacturing overcapacity since January 2016, to reduce its
capacity further.
    
    SINGAPORE DEAL
    After sessions on improving connectivity and the
multilateral system and a host of bilateral meetings, the summit
was due to finish on Friday with the EU signing an agreement
with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
    That pact has been eight years in the making. Negotiations
ended in 2014, but as protests mounted against other trade
accords, such as one planned with the United States and one
struck with Canada, the deal was sent for approval to the
European Court of Justice 
    The Commission hopes the agreement, which still needs the
backing of the European Parliament, will take effect next year.
    It would likely follow a larger free trade agreement that
the EU plans with Japan, and would be the EU's first trade
agreement with a member of the 10-strong Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
    The EU remains interested in a deal with ASEAN, after talks
were shelved in 2009. In the meantime, it has agreed a trade
accord with Vietnam, is in negotiations with Indonesia, and has
held talks with three other ASEAN members.

    ANKARA/PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The leaders of Turkey,
Russia, Germany and France will hold a summit on the Syrian
conflict in Istanbul next week, officials said on Friday, a
month after Ankara and Moscow brokered a deal to create a
demilitarised zone in the northwest Idlib region.
    Idlib and adjacent areas are the last stronghold of rebels
who rose up against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. The area
is also home to an estimated three million people, more than
half of whom have already been displaced once during the war.
    Turkey and Russia reached a deal last month to set up a
buffer zone running 15-20 km (9-13 miles) into rebel territory
that had to be evacuated of all heavy weapons and all jihadists
by Monday. The agreement averted a planned offensive on Idlib by
Russia, Assad's biggest outside backer.
    The four countries will hold the talks on Oct. 27 and will
discuss Idlib, and the political process for the resolution of
the Syrian conflict, the spokesman for Turkish President Tayyip
Erdogan was quoted by state-owned media as saying. [nL8N1WZ26U]
    France wants to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib,
and thereby prevent a new exodus of refugees, President Emmanuel
Macron's office said.
    ""We want to keep this stability and work from this agreement
to move into a new phase of discussions on a political process,""
one senior French diplomatic source said. ""And that it helps
launch this constitutional committee that the U.N. is working on
so that it meets as quickly as possible.""
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel will focus on the situation
in Idlib and supporting the implementation of the Sochi
agreement between Russia and Turkey, a German government
spokeswoman said.
    ""The Federal Government sees Russia, as an ally of the Assad
regime, as a partner with a very particular responsibility,"" the
spokeswoman said.
    U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said on Thursday that
Russia and Turkey plan to give more time for the implementation
of the de-escalation deal in Idlib. 
    But he cautiouned there were still ""a million unanswered
questions"" about how the deal would work, and what would happen
if groups designated as terrorists refused to lay down their
weapons. [nL8N1WY44I]
    U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said this week he would
step down at the end of November for family reasons, quitting as
the Syrian government - backed by Iran and Russia - has retaken
most of the country and a political deal remains elusive.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Shares in Spanish banks rebounded
on Friday after the Supreme Court said it would review the
impact of a ruling on mortgage stamp duty after initially saying
on Thursday that banks would have to pay the tax.
    The court said that, as the ruling was a ""radical change"" in
its criteria and had an ""enormous economic and social impact"", a
senior judge agreed to suspend all pending appeals on the
matter.
    The Supreme Court ruling had unexpectedly overturned a
previous ruling from earlier this year and though it was final
it didn't state from when clients were entitled to be
compensated.
    Now the Court has to say if this new ruling would set a
judicial precedent on future rulings.
    The Spanish legal system allows customers to potentially
reclaim any compensation from tax authorities for cases going
back four years.
    Spain's Budget Minister, María Jesús Montero, on Friday said
that the government would study the consequences of the ruling.
    Shares in all Spanish banks had suffered big declines on the
ruling on Thursday as that could leave banks potentially exposed
to billions of euros in legal provisions.
    On Friday, Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Bankia <BKIA.MC>,
which fell 6 percent and 4 percent, reversed losses, while other
lenders, such as Caixabank <CABK.MC> and Bankinter <BKT.MC>,
rose up to 1 percent.
    Thursday's ruling comes at a sensitive moment for Spanish
banks as they struggle to glean earnings from loans with
interest rates at historic lows and as increasing competition
erodes margins.
    Analysts had estimated that Spanish banks could end up
paying anything between 1.7 billion euros and 10 billion euros
in compensation following the decision.
    It was the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders after a
European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that banks had
to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with interest
rate floors that were not clearly explained.

    By Christopher Thompson
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ernest Hemingway
famously told how a dissipated jolly in Spain ended in emotional
tragedy. Spanish lenders still recovering from their own
post-crisis excesses hit a similarly heart-rending note on
Thursday after the country’s top court ruled that they – not
customers – were liable to pay taxes on mortgages. Even in the
worst case, however, any melancholy should be manageable. 
    Investors who dumped Spanish bank shares on news of the
ruling could be forgiven for assuming the worst. Lenders are
already struggling with low profitability and thin margins.
Claims for reimbursement invite comparisons with British banks,
which have forked out tens of billions of pounds in compensation
to customers who were missold payment protection insurance. 
    However, it is not clear that the requirement to pay the
Spanish tax – which normally ranges between 0.5 and 1.5 percent
of the value of the mortgage – would apply retroactively.
Secondly, tax refunds can only be backdated by a maximum of four
years, according to the Spanish Banking Association, meaning
that banks would only have to cover the bill for loans agreed in
that period. 
    In a worst-case scenario the ruling would therefore apply to
around 153 billion euros in new mortgages, using Bank of Spain
figures. Assuming an average tax of 1 percent, total claims
would be 1.53 billion euros. That would be painful but hardly
critical for a sector expected to deliver 9.5 billion euros in
net profit by 2020, according to Berenberg analysts.  
    Take Caixabank <CABK.MC>, one of the biggest mortgage
lenders. The Valencia-based lender has doled out around 20
billion euros in new housing loans over the last four years,
implying a maximum liability of 200 million euros. That would
knock a mere 14 basis points off its common equity Tier 1
capital ratio of 11.26 percent. Yet Caixabank lost around 1
billion euros of market value on Thursday, before recovering
slightly on Friday morning after the Supreme Court said it would
review the decision. 
    Though lending is still contracting in Spain, the rate of
decline is slowing, suggesting that Spanish banks’ post-crisis
balance sheet shrinkage is coming to an end. Moreover, 12-month
Euribor interest rates, which are typically the basis for
mortgages in the country, are rising. That would assist banks on
their road to recovery, despite the latest knock.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Spain's Supreme Court said it would review a ruling on
mortgage stamp duty on Oct. 19, a day after stating that banks
had to pay the tax, sparking a sector-wide selloff. 
    - The court said that as the ruling was a ""radical change""
in its criteria and had an ""enormous economic and social
impact"", a senior judge agreed to suspend all pending appeals on
the matter, Reuters reported. 
    - Shares in Spanish banks fell sharply on Oct. 18 after the
court said lenders must pay stamp duty on mortgage loans which
had previously been paid by customers, raising the prospect of
potentially billions of euros in compensation. 
    - “The Supreme Court states that the person who must pay the
stamp duty in the public deeds of loans with mortgage guarantees
is the lender, not the one who receives the loan,” the court
said in a document, cited by Reuters on Oct. 18. 
    - After the court ruling, shares in Bankia fell more than 7
percent, while Banco Sabadell and Caixabank fell 6 percent and
5.5 percent, respectively.

    KIEV, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced on Friday it
would raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter as Prime
Minister Volodymyr Groysman warned that the country risked
default if it crashed out of its International Monetary Fund aid
programme.
    Raising household gas tariffs is a key condition of IMF aid,
but Kiev had until now refused to increase them.  
    ""We have no other option to prevent extremely difficult
events,"" Groysman said during a televised cabinet meeting.
    ""If we are not able to continue cooperation with our
international partners,"" Groysman warned, then the country will
not be able to service its debt. 
    ""This may lead to the situation when Ukraine will be put
into default,"" he said.
    Ukraine's eurobonds rose across the curve following the
announcement. [nL8N1WZ4WD]  
    Ukraine was obliged to raise household gas tariffs to
qualify for more aid under a $17.5 billion IMF programme that
expires next year, when the country heads into two elections and
must service a rising debt burden.
    IMF aid has been effectively frozen since April 2017 as
Ukraine's performance on reforms slowed down and due to the
government's refusal to raise gas prices, which have been kept
artificially low since Soviet times, to market levels.
    If Ukraine receives another tranche of IMF money, that would
also allow the government to go to the market to issue new debt
and would also pave the way for the European Union and other
foreign donors to disburse more aid.
    Groysman said household gas prices would be raised by 23.5
percent from Nov 1.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt-October 19: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Germany-based 
life insurer VOLKSWOHL BUND LEBENSVERSICHERUNG a.G.'s (VBL) Insurer Financial 
Strength (IFS) Rating at 'A' (Strong). The Outlook is Stable.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The affirmation reflects VBL's strong capitalisation and business profile. Our 
assessment of asset/liability management, although strong, partially offsets 
these strengths. 

We expect Fitch's Prism Factor Based Model (FBM) score for VBL to remain at the 
mid-range of the 'Strong' category at end-2018. However, asset growth is likely 
to extend the declining trend in capitalisation. Fitch's Prism FBM model score 
for the company was at the mid-range of 'Strong' at end-2017. 

We anticipate that VBL's Solvency II ratio (as measured without reserve 
transitional) will be stable at end-2018. However, the ratio could prove 
volatile if interest rates change. The company reported a Solvency II ratio of 
253% for the group at end-2017. The strong improvement from the ratio of 184% 
reported for end-2016 reflects in our view the reduction in the asset-liability 
duration mismatch.

We expect VBL's asset/liability management to remain strong in 2018. Investment 
in longer duration bonds increased the asset duration while a more favourable 
new business mix implied a decline in the liability duration in 2017. Both 
contributed to a smaller duration gap between assets and liabilities. We regard 
VBL's duration mismatch to be of 'A' category. 

We assume that VBL maintains its strong business profile in 2018. With total 
assets of EUR14.3 billion at end-2017, VBL is of moderate operating scale. It 
has a strong franchise in its primary distribution channels of independent 
financial advisors and sales organisations. Its gross written premiums  (GWP) 
increased by 1.3% in 2017, while the market's GWP declined 0.2%. 

We expect VBL to maintain its strong underwriting profitability in 2018. VBL 
reported a return on equity of 19.6% for 2017. Its profitability benefits from 
its strong market position in disability insurance which is one of the most 
profitable lines in the German life market. Disability contributed 22.4% to 
VBL's life premium income, more than double of our estimated market share of 
10%. 

However, increased costs for the additional mathematical reserve 
(Zinszusatzreserve or ZZR) and lower realisations from investment gains for 
financing these costs reduced VBL's transfer to the funds for future 
appropriations (FFA) in 2017. We expect that the ZZR will be recalibrated for 
the financial year 2018. This will result in lower ZZR expenses and a recovery 
of the FFA transfer to prior years' level.  

RATING SENSITIVITIES

A deterioration in VBL's capital position as evidenced, for example, by the 
Prism FBM score falling to the low end of the 'Strong' category could lead to a 
downgrade. 

A delay in the effective date of the recalibration of the ZZR to 2019 could 
result in the Prism FBM score falling to the 'Adequate' category, especially if 
VBL doesn't realise additional investment gains for the higher ZZR expenses. 
This would likely lead to a downgrade.

A weakened business profile as evidenced, for example, by a strong decline in 
premium income, could also result in a downgrade.

Improvements in diversification, as evidenced,  for example by the non-life 
segment contributing a material proportion to total premium income, could lead 
to an upgrade. However, we view such a change as unlikely.

 (Updates with end of meeting, quotes)
    By Philip Blenkinsop and Robin Emmott
    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The European Union signed a
free-trade deal with Singapore at a summit with Asian leaders on
Friday and pressed China to allow greater foreign investment in
its economy, but ran into familiar resistance from Beijing over
state subsidies.
    At a biennial Asia-Europe Meeting bringing together leaders
representing 65 percent of global economic output, France,
Britain, Germany, Italy and the European Commission held private
meetings with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, hoping for greater
access for EU companies to the world's No. 2 economy.
    When asked about Chinese trade practices, Austrian
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told reporters after the summit that
Europe expected rules to be upheld, and wanted reforms of the
World Trade Organization.
    ""When we find protectionism, we reject it. Free trade must
always be fair, equitable and based on rules. That goes in both
directions,"" he said. 
    Li told British Prime Minister Theresa May that he ""looked
forward to ushering in a diamond era"" after their bilateral
meeting, a British government statement said.
    In a sign of China's outsized role, Li led the pack of
European and Asian leaders along the summit red carpet and stood
in the centre of the 50 other leaders for a photo, alongside
Merkel and the summit chair, European Council President Donald
Tusk. 
    
    LESS OR MORE STATE CONTROL?
    China has been promising for years to ease restrictions on
foreign investment, but Western governments say little has
changed and many are worried that Beijing is heading towards
more state control under President Xi Jinping.
    China restricts foreign investment more than the EU in every
sector except real estate, according to a report by the Rhodium
Group consultancy.
    French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with Li on
Thursday evening, lobbying for better access to China's poultry,
dairy, pharmaceuticals, services and financial services sectors,
a French official said. 
    But there was no sign of a breakthrough. ""Some gestures have
been made, but it must go further now,"" the official said.
    China did appear to win some sympathy for U.S. President
Donald Trump's tariffs on billions of dollars of its exports. 
    Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, visiting Brussels on
official business for the first time since Moscow annexed Crimea
in 2014, told his counterparts: ""At this table, there are the
leaders of countries that have experienced the signs of those
trade wars in full. And it is, probably, the saddest thing that
is happening now.""
    A final summit communique omitted a call for an end to
government trade distortions that EU officials had hoped for.
    China requested the changes at talks between senior EU and
Asian officials overnight, two diplomats said. The statement
instead committed to ""free and open trade on a level playing
field"" and to fighting ""all forms of protectionism"", in an
indirect reference to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports.
    An earlier draft, seen by Reuters, had called for ""the
elimination of unjustifiable market distorting measures by
governments"".
    
    SUBSIDIES
    The European Union and the United States accuse China of
directly funding state companies through Chinese banks to help
them to dominate global markets, breaking rules set down by the
World Trade Organization, of which China is a member.
    After sessions on improving connectivity and the
multilateral system and a host of bilateral meetings, the summit
finished on Friday with the EU signing the agreement with
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
    That pact has been eight years in the making. Negotiations
ended in 2014, but as protests mounted against other trade
accords, such as one planned with the United States and one
struck with Canada, the deal was sent for approval to the
European Court of Justice 
    Singapore and the Commission hope the agreement, which still
needs the backing of the European Parliament, will take effect
next year.
    It would probably follow a larger free trade agreement that
the EU plans with Japan, and would be the EU's first trade
agreement with a member of the 10-strong Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
    The EU remains interested in a deal with ASEAN, after talks
were shelved in 2009. In the meantime, it has agreed a trade
accord with Vietnam, is in negotiations with Indonesia, and has
held talks with three other ASEAN members.

 (Adds details of review process; global regulation context;
lawyer comment)
    By Inti Landauro
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The global watchdog for money
laundering will set up its first rules on oversight of
cryptocurrencies by June, a major step towards creating
international standards for an asset currently subject to patchy
regulations.
    The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said on
Friday jurisdictions worldwide will be required to license or
regulate cryptocurrency exchanges and some firms providing
encrypted wallets, to help stamp out the use of digital money
for money laundering, terrorism financing or other crimes.
    Firms providing financial services for issuances of new
cryptocurrencies - initial coin offerings - must also be subject
to the rules, it said.
    Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens whose creators say they
can be used as money without the backing of any country's
central bank. 
    Until now, their regulation has defied global coordination
and led to a patchwork of differing approaches by national
governments. 
    How countries implement the rules will be subject to
periodic reviews by the watchdog, said its President Marshall
Billingslea. Countries judged to be falling short could be added
to an FATF blacklist that restricts access to the global
financial system.
    ""By June, we will issue additional instructions on the
standards and how we expect them to be enforced,"" he said.
    The first and most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, which
has been followed by hundreds of others.
    The price of bitcoin soared 1,300 percent last year to a
record of near $20,000 in December but has since plummeted. It
was trading at around $6,390 on Friday afternoon. 
    Extreme price volatility, along with regular thefts from
exchanges, have vexed regulators. In the absence of global
rules, countries have taken contrasting routes to taming the
sector. 
    Japan last year became the first to regulate cryptocurrency
exchanges, while China and South Korea clamped down heavily on
them.
    In Europe, several countries including France, Switzerland
and Malta are looking at early-stage supervision by regulating
initial coin offerings.
    Lawyers specialising in anti-money laundering welcomed the
FATF move, but warned that challenges remain in tracing the true
owner of cryptocurrencies.
    ""You can put any name down for these coin exchanges, and it
doesn't have to be the ultimate beneficial owner,"" said Kyle
Phillips at law firm Howard Kennedy in London.

 (Adds quotes and background on sanctions)
    By Robin Emmott and Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Cambodia failed on Friday to
allay criticisms of authoritarianism and rights abuses that
threaten the country's duty-free trading access to the European
Union, the EU's top diplomat said after talks with its premier.
    Brussels began a formal procedure this month to strip
Cambodia of its special trade status, worth billions of euros a
year, following July elections that returned strongman Hun Sen
to power after 30 years in office and gave his party all
parliamentary seats.
    EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini held talks with
the prime minister in Brussels during a summit of 51 European
and Asian leaders. She said later she had not heard anything
that would avert trade sanctions.
    ""We discussed this, I cannot say that we found solutions to
any of these issues,"" Mogherini told a news conference. 
    ""There is a lot of concern in Europe ... about the
dissolution of the opposition and the narrowed democratic space
for political opposition and civil society.""
    The bloc's review of Cambodia's duty-free access to the EU
means Cambodian sugar, garments and other exports could face
tariffs within 12 months under EU rules and make the country
less attractive for retailers exporting to Europe. 
    EU countries accounted for around 40 percent of Cambodia's
foreign sales in 2016. Clothing factories employ around 700,000
workers. 
    Its exports to the European Union were worth 5 billion euros
($5.8 billion) last year, according to EU data, up from
negligible levels less than a decade ago, before the trade
status.

    MYANMAR ALSO ACCUSED
    Dozens of Cambodians gathered outside the summit venue in
Brussels to protest against Hun Sen's policies. 
    He declined to answer questions from reporters, waving his
hand and walking away when asked if he was concerned about the
impending sanctions.
    Mogherini also met Myanmar's Minister for International
Cooperation Kyaw Tin in Brussels and raised the prospect of
similar trade sanctions to punish the country for what the West
says is its ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims.
    A recent U.N. report accused Myanmar's military of gang
rapes and mass killings with ""genocidal intent"" in Rakhine state
and called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be
prosecuted under international law.
    Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report,
blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"" for most accounts of atrocities.
    ""We won't close our eyes to violations that the
international community sees as worrying,"" Mogherini said. ""Our
trade preferences have the respect for human rights at their
core.""

was illegally obtained, but the proposal will put the burden of

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May struck an upbeat tone on the Brexit talks and told business
leaders during a teleconference on Friday that EU politicians
are committed to reaching an agreement this autumn, a source
told Reuters.
    London and Brussels are racing to strike a deal by the end
of the year and firms are worried that without one, there could
be widespread disruption of everything from supply chains to
flights and the movement of food and livestock. 
    May briefed around 120 business leaders to update them on
the progress of the talks after discussions in Brussels earlier
this week. 
    ""The Prime Minister spoke for about 10 minutes and the tone
of her message was quite optimistic,"" a source familiar with the
content of the call told Reuters. 
    ""She said she believed that the European leaders were very
much committed to an agreement this autumn. She said that her
aim was to wrap this up in November."" 
    May was told by some that time is pressing and heard
concerns over contingency measures which may be irreversible,
the source said. 
    She was also asked what business could do to help on Brexit,
to which she suggested firms write to lawmakers, and in Europe,
make sure leaders are aware that they need a resolution.
    Stephen Martin, director general of Institute of Directors,
who was on the call, told the BBC:
    ""She made it clear that she is very keen to get a deal as
quickly as we possibly can with the withdrawal agreement."" 
    May's office declined to offer an immediate comment when
contacted by Reuters but said it would issue a statement
shortly.

    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May is ready to agree to a fallback arrangement for the border
between the United Kingdom and Ireland which does not have a
time limit, to speed Brexit talks, Bloomberg reported https://bloom.bg/2R27fq6
 on Friday, citing unnamed sources.
    Arrangements for the United Kingdom's only land border with
a European Union state have proven the biggest sticking point as
London and Brussels seek to hammer out a transitional deal

    Britain's Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, said just a week
ago that the so-called backstop designed to prevent a hard
border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland, must be finite, short and time-limited.
    However, Bloomberg reported that May and her team of Brexit
advisers now accepted the EU's point that it must be open-ended,
for an ""enduring"" solution, citing an unnamed person familiar
with the talks.
    Brexit supporters in May's government are concerned any
temporary arrangements with the EU that lack a clear time limit
may become permanent solutions over time.
    Sterling strengthened by around a quarter of a cent against

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): Cyprus - Rating Action Report

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10048955

Fitch Ratings-London-October 19: Fitch Ratings has upgraded Cyprus's Long-Term 
Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. The Outlooks 
are Stable. 

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The upgrade of Cyprus's IDRs reflects the following key rating drivers and their 
relative weights:

High

Buoyant fiscal revenue and prudent fiscal policy mean we expect Cyprus will 
record a fiscal surplus of 2.7% of GDP in 2018, compared with a target of 1.7% 
in the April 2018 Stability Programme Update and a current 'BBB' median fiscal 
deficit of 2%. We forecast the fiscal surplus will remain high at 2.4% and 2.2% 
of GDP in 2019 and 2020, respectively, compared with 3.1% and 2.9% targeted in 
the 2019 Draft Budgetary Plan. Robust economic growth will boost fiscal 
receipts, while previously adopted hiring freeze and collective agreements will 
likely limit growth in the wage bill. 

Cyprus's gross general government debt (GGGD)/GDP will remain on a firm downward 
trajectory, despite a one-off expected increase in 2018. Following the placement 
into Cyprus Cooperative Bank (CCB) of EUR3.19 billion government bonds (15.5% of 
GDP) to facilitate the acquisition of part of the state-owned bank by Hellenic 
Bank (HB), GGGD/GDP is set to increase to 104.4% at end-2018 from 95.7% in 2017. 
However, we expect large primary surpluses, robust growth and contained nominal 
effective interest rates will reduce GGGD/GDP to 70% of GDP by 2027.

Medium

The ratio of non-performing exposures (NPEs) to total loans decreased to 
pro-forma 40.3% in 1H18 from 44% in 2017 as per the Central Bank of Cyprus, 
partly supported by the announced securitisation by Bank of Cyprus (BoC) of 
EUR2.7 billion gross NPEs, which is still subject to regulatory approval by the 
European Central Bank. The acquisition by HB of CCB's good assets and the 
subsequent transfer into a run-off entity of CCB's EUR5.7 billion NPEs portfolio 
are estimated to have led to a further decrease in NPEs to 30% in September 
2018. This will support a substantial decrease in contingent liabilities 
stemming from the banking sector, although these remain large. 

The government has taken further decisive steps to address legacy issues within 
the banking sector. Key legislative amendments aimed at facilitating NPEs 
securitisation and sales of loans, and strengthening foreclosure and insolvency 
toolkits were adopted by the parliament in July. The government also intends to 
launch a subsidy scheme to defaulting borrowers (Estia scheme) in January 2019, 
which implies loan restructurings and state subsidies to incentivise loan 
repayment. So far, use of foreclosure instruments has been negligible and the 
degree of implementation of the scheme and enforcement of the new legislative 
package remains uncertain.

Additional fiscal costs could arise from potential calls on the 
government-guaranteed Asset Protection Scheme, covering unexpected losses on 
EUR2.6 billion of CCB's assets acquired by HB. State subsidies related to the 
Estia scheme and increased debt servicing costs following government support to 
CCB are estimated at a yearly 0.5% of GDP by the government and are already 
captured in our forecasts. 

Cyprus is benefitting from a strong economic recovery with real GDP reaching 
pre-crisis level and the economy forecasted by Fitch to grow 4% in 2018 and 3.8% 
in 2019, supported by large foreign-financed investment projects in construction 
and tourism, and robust private consumption.

Cyprus's 'BBB-' IDRs also reflect the following key rating drivers:

Cyprus's ratings are supported by a high level of GDP per capita, strong 
governance indicators and a favourable business environment significantly above 
'BBB' rated peers' and closer to 'A' category peer levels.

Private sector debt and non-performing exposures remain high, however, at 226% 
(excluding special purpose entities) and 97% of GDP in 1Q18, respectively, and 
constrain credit growth. Household and corporate debt stood at 105% and 121% of 
GDP and a large part of the recent decline in such debt stemmed mostly from high 
GDP growth, debt-to-asset swaps, loan write-offs, rather than loan repayment.

We expect private sector deleveraging will accelerate, however, as enforcement 
of new legal amendments, improving earnings and recovering house prices foster 
debt repayment. Economic growth will likely remain resilient to a faster 
resolution in NPEs as rising wages, a dynamic labour market and high household 
savings will help preserve disposable income and smooth consumption.

The banking sector remains extremely weak as reflected by Fitch Banking System 
Indicator (BSI) of 'b'. Very weak asset quality and high NPE ratios are still 
weighing on new lending and profitability. The acquisition of CCB's healthy 
assets by HB, respectively the second- and third-largest banks of the country, 
will result in further concentration within the sector between the two large 
national banks, with total banking sector's assets still accounting for a high 
336% of GDP at end-1H18 (352% at end-2017). Unreserved NPEs for BoC and HB will 
also decrease to an estimated EUR3.8 billion (19% of GDP) following the sale of 
CCB assets and BoC transaction, but could lead to some capital shortfall if 
losses are crystallised and higher-than-expected haircuts incurred on 
collateral. This level of unreserved NPEs is significant relative to the banks' 
common equity Tier 1 capital, highlighting their vulnerability to asset quality 
shocks.

Banking sector liquidity has improved after a 0.8% decline in deposits in 1Q18 
due to uncertainty around the CCB sale. A highly indebted private sector has led 
to an accumulation of liquid assets and a decrease in the loan-to-deposit ratio 
to 91% in July 2018 (104% in 2017). Non-resident deposits in locally active 
credit institutions, however, still represent 29.5% of total deposits in 1H18, 
albeit on a declining trend. These are largely short-term funding and 
confidence-sensitive and would likely become more volatile than domestic 
deposits in case of stress. 

Fitch forecasts the current account deficit will widen to 6.7% of GDP in 2018 
and 7.2% in 2019, compared with the current 'BBB' median of 1.6%, as strong 
domestic demand, especially in the construction sector, fuels imports. When 
excluding special purpose entities (SPEs) including shipping and financial 
companies that materially distort external statistics, the current account 
deficit decreases substantially, according to the Central Bank of Cyprus. 
Cyprus's net external debt (NXD) turned into a small asset position in 2Q18, 
when adjusted for SPEs, compared with a non-adjusted NXD of 154% at-end 2017 and 
a current 'BBB' median of 7.7%. 

Cyprus's financing flexibility has improved substantially since the country 
exited the macroeconomic adjustment programme in March 2016. The government 
improved access to capital markets by issuing Eurobonds in June 2017 and 
September 2018. The sovereign has a large cash buffer, which accounts for 11% of 
GDP and covers more than the government's medium-term debt management strategy 
of prefunding the next nine months of gross financing needs. 

Fitch has revised the Country Ceiling to 'A' from 'BBB+'. It is now four notches 
above the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, up from three previously.  This 
reflects Cyprus's recent structural economic and financial sector adjustments 
and reduced risk of capital controls. It is still below the maximum possible 
six-notch uplift for eurozone member states, owing to the weakness of the 
banking sector and recent history of capital controls.

SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO)

Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Cyprus a score equivalent to a rating of 'A-' on 
the Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LT FC) IDR scale. 

Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at 
the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows:

-External: -1 to reflect the high share of non-resident deposits in the banking 
sector, recent history of capital control and banking crisis. Although external 
financing flexibility has improved, these factors still point to risks over and 
above those captured in the SRM. 

- Structural features: -2 notches, to reflect the banking sector weakness that 
could pose large contingent liability to the sovereign and lead to 
macro-stability risks.

Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that 
employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of 
forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a 
forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the 
SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria 
that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive 
action include: 

-Materially reduced contingent liabilities to the sovereign stemming from the 
banking sector, for example from declining NPEs or an upgrade in the sector's 
Viability Ratings; 

-Marked reduction in the GGGD/GDP ratio; and 

-Continued deleveraging of the private sector. 

Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative 
action include: 

-Heightened risks in the banking sector, for example from deterioration in asset 
quality; and 

-Stalling of the decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratio, for example due to 
deterioration of budget balances, weak growth or materialisation of contingent 
liabilities.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Gross government debt-reducing operations such as future privatisations are not 
considered in Fitch's baseline scenario. The projections also do not include the 
impact of potential future gas reserves off the southern shores of Cyprus, the 
benefits from which are several years into the future.

Fitch does not expect substantial progress with reunification talks between the 
Greek and Turkish Cypriots over the next quarters. The reunification would bring 
economic benefits to both sides in the long term but would entail short-term 
costs and uncertainties. 

The full list of rating actions is as follows:

Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; 
Outlook Stable

Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs upgraded to 'F3' from 'B'

Country Ceiling upgraded to 'A' from 'BBB+'

Issue ratings on long-term senior unsecured local-currency bonds upgraded to 
'BBB-' from 'BB+'

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands - 
Rating Action Report

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10047560

Fitch Ratings-Barcelona-October 19: Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Autonomous 
Community of the Canary Islands' (the Canaries) Long-Term Foreign- and 
Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. The Outlooks 
are Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the region's Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR 
at 'F2'. The ratings on the outstanding senior unsecured bonds have also been 
upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'.	

The upgrade reflects the Canary Islands' improving direct debt burden, great 
financial support from the central government and strong improvement of fiscal 
performance in recent years, particularly in 2017. The Stable Outlook 
incorporates Fitch's expectations that the autonomous community will continue to 
post a structural positive current balance, with direct debt declining below 
100% of current revenue in 2018.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The upgrade of the Canary Islands' IDR reflects the following key rating drivers 
and their relative weights:

High

Debt (Neutral/Stable)

The direct debt grew further in 2017 to EUR6.8 billion (2016: EUR6.7 billion), 
but declined in relative terms to 101.9% of current revenue (2016: 111.6%). At 
end-2017, about 70% of the debt was made of soft loans from the central 
government. Fitch expects that a large part of funding needs will continue to be 
covered by the mechanisms granted by the central government. The expected 
improvement in current revenue and the current balance will drive direct debt 
below 100% of current revenue and the payback ratio by nine to ten years in 
2018. 

Medium

Fiscal Performance (Neutral/Stable) 

Operating revenue increased by more than EUR700 million in 2017 (ie 12% yoy). 
This, coupled with the increase of operating expenditure by 7.25%, meant that 
operating balance continued to spike reaching EUR687 million in 2017 (EUR372 
million in 2016), after the already strong improvement reported in 2016, boosted 
by higher self-collected taxes and the tax settlement of EUR530 million in 2015 
(about 8% of operating revenue). This improvement meant that the Canary Islands 
were able to post a current margin of as much as 8.9% (2016: 4.8). The Canary 
Islands were even able to report positive results once the capital balance and 
funding were integrated into regional public companies. 

After the turnaround in the past four years, our rating case scenario now 
assumes that the operating margin will stabilise at around 11%, while a surplus 
would be reported in 2018-2020. 

Economy (Neutral/Stable)

The Canary Islands have a weaker economic profile than Spain, with a GDP per 
capita (EUR20,425) equivalent to 81.7% of the national figure, which is average 
by international standards. The economy is recovering after having grown by 4.1% 
in 2017 (4% for Spain) to an estimated nominal EUR44.2 billion. We expect 
recovery to continue in the medium term in part due to strong domestic 
consumption and the solid performance of the tourism sector, which is one of the 
pillars of the archipelago's economy. Overnight stays reached 71 million in 
2017, rising by 2% yoy, as one of the region's assets is its mild winter 
temperature. 

Development in the labour market has continued to be positive, with stronger job 
growth in the past five years, as 76% of jobs previously lost between 2007 and 
2012 were recovered by end-2017. The recovery process has continued during the 
first half of 2018, and we expect a net increase in jobs in 2018 and 2019. 
Nevertheless, The Canary Islands still have a relatively weak employment rate 
estimated at 46.2% in 2017, which is slightly below Spain's at 48.7%. 

Low 

Institutional Framework (Neutral/Stable)

The Canary Islands' institutional framework reflects their stable regulatory 
regime, their debt restrictions, a lack of revenue flexibility, the improving 
transparency of their accounts and an unfavourable tax equalisation system. 

The institutional framework for Spanish autonomous communities improved with the 
introduction of the Budgetary Stability Law (BSL) in 2012 and the Law to Control 
Commercial Debt in 2013. Fitch introduced a rating floor of 'BBB-', based on a 
number of supporting factors that mitigate a region's liquidity risk, reducing 
the likelihood of default. These include the absolute priority of debt servicing 
by law as per article 135 of the Spanish Constitution, access to state liquidity 
mechanisms and the BSL, which enforces fiscal discipline on local and regional 
governments.

At end-2017, as much as 70% of the Canary Islands' direct debt (EUR6,881 
million) was contracted through state mechanisms, from which the region received 
EUR747.3 million during 2017, representing almost 98% of the new borrowing 
contracted in 2017. 

Management (Strong/Stable)

The regional administration has controlled operating and capital spending 
proportionate to revenue collection, avoiding budget slippages and paying its 
commercial liabilities on time. The Canary Islands have also met the 
progressively tight financial goals since the BSL came into force in 2012, 
becoming one of the few Spanish regions to post an overall fiscal surplus in 
2017 (0.64%), and is on track to meet its target of 0.4% for 2018.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

A positive rating action may result from a structural operating margin above 15% 
in the medium term. 

A debt-to-current revenue ratio above 100% could trigger a negative rating 
action.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch assumes that the state will continue providing support to the Spanish 
autonomous communities over the medium term, in particular, through the 
liquidity mechanism. 

Discussions on the regional financial system are ongoing in Spain, and changes 
are in prospect over the medium term. Nevertheless, Fitch does not expect the 
Canary Islands' revenue to decrease as a result.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona-October 19: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Autonomous 
Community of Andalusia's (Andalusia) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency 
Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB-' with Stable Outlooks. Fitch has also 
affirmed the region's Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at 'F3'. Its outstanding 
senior unsecured bonds have been affirmed at 'BBB-' and its commercial paper 
(pagares) programme has been affirmed at 'BBB-'/'F3'.

The affirmation reflects Andalusia's broadly weak, but significantly improved, 
fiscal performance in 2017, a moderately high direct debt burden, a weak socio 
economic profile and financial support from the central government. The Stable 
Outlook incorporates Fitch's expectations that the region's fiscal performance 
will gradually improve, with direct debt declining to 137%-140% of current 
revenue in 2018-2020.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Fiscal Performance (Neutral/ Stable) 

Fitch has revised its assessment to neutral from weak after Andalusia reported 
an operating margin of 5.6% in 2017 (1.4% in 2016), following a negative trend 
between 2011 and 2015. Higher revenue was the major contributor to the 
improvement, as operating expenditure only increased 1.3%. We expect the 
operating margin to slightly improve in the medium term to 5%-6%, as tax revenue 
should continue to benefit from improved labour conditions. We assume that the 
regional government would aim to keep spending growth at 3%-3.5% to comply with 
spending limits announced for 2019-2021. We expect the overall deficit to 
continue narrowing, albeit at a more moderate pace. 

Institutional Framework (Neutral/Stable) 

The institutional framework of Andalusia reflects its stable regulatory regime, 
its debt restrictions, a lack of revenue flexibility, the improving transparency 
of its accounts and a favourable tax equalisation system. 

Fitch introduced in February 2013 an investment-grade rating floor at 'BBB-' for 
Spanish autonomous communities, based on their fiscal and financial discipline 
and the available financial mechanisms to refund debt. The introduction of the 
Budgetary Stability Law (BSL) has meant an increase of control by the central 
government via a higher number of targets to comply with not only overall 
deficits but also spending, debt and  payment term limits. This is in return for 
support from the central government, which includes the absolute priority of 
debt servicing by law as per article 135 of the Spanish Constitution; access to 
state liquidity mechanisms such as the Regional Liquidity Fund (FLA), the 
Financial Facility Fund, and the BSL, which enforces fiscal discipline on local 
and regional governments.

Debt (Neutral/Stable)

Andalusia's direct debt grew to EUR32.9 billion in 2017 from EUR31.9 billion in 
2016 and we expect a further increase towards EUR34 billion-EUR36 billion in 
2019-2020. However, direct debt as a share of current revenue is likely to 
decline, due to expected improvement in current revenue to 137% in 2020 (142.7% 
in 2017). State liquidity, at an average interest rate of around 0.9% in 2018, 
should help Andalusia maintain a moderate debt burden despite its high nominal 
debt. Interest payments amounted to EUR463 million in 2017, compared with EUR948 
million in 2013. 

Access to state support will continue to ensure timely debt servicing as the 
region faces significant redemptions over the next three years, which at 
end-2017 were 40% of estimated outstanding direct debt. As a result, the share 
of state liquidity in the region's total debt will grow over the medium term. 
The region at end-2017 had EUR25.2 billion in debt from state liquidity 
mechanisms, close to 76% of its total direct debt, illustrating strong support 
from the central government.

Economy (Neutral/Stable)

With a nominal GDP of EUR155 billion and a population of about 8.37 million 
Andalusia has a weaker economic profile than Spain, with a GDP per capita 
equivalent to 74% of the national average, although this is average by 
international standards. Its GDP grew 3.8% in 2017, slightly below Spain's 4%. 
Housing prices are also below Spanish average (21% in 2Q18) although prices 
differ widely across the regional territory. Development in the labour market 
continued to be positive, with almost 97,000 jobs created in 2017. Nevertheless, 
its employment rate at 42.7% in 2017 (of the population aged 16 and above) 
remains significantly below the national average of 48.7%. 

Management (Neutral/Stable)

Andalusia had a stable administration team, supported by the long-standing 
governing party Socialist Party, with the support of Ciudadanos since 2015, 
until the pact was broken in September 2018. New elections will be held on 2 
December 2018. Compliance with fiscal stability goals remains a priority and, in 
2017, Andalusia met the BSL's 0.6% fiscal deficit goal, with an overall fiscal 
deficit of 0.41%.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The ratings could be upgraded if the regional government reports a structurally 
positive current balance and a decline in direct debt below 130% of current 
revenue, associated with a sustained recovery of socio-economic indicators.

Direct debt exceeding 150% of current revenue or a negative operating balance 
may weaken Andalusia's credit profile, but this will not impact the IDRs as long 
as the floor support of 'BBB-' for Spanish autonomous communities is maintained.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch assumes that the state will continue providing support to the Spanish 
autonomous communities over the medium term, in particular, through the 
liquidity mechanism.

Discussions on the regional financial system are ongoing in Spain, and changes 
are in prospect over the medium term. However, Fitch does not factor in such 
changes into Andalusia's IDRs.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Barcelona-October 19: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Autonomous 
Community of Valencia's Long-Term Foreign and Local-Currency Issuer Default 
Ratings (IDR) at 'BBB-' with Stable Outlooks. Fitch has also affirmed the 
region's Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F3'. The ratings on the region's 
senior unsecured outstanding bonds have been affirmed at 'BBB-'.  

The affirmation reflects the unchanged 'BBB-' rating floor applied to Spanish 
autonomous communities, including Valencia. This supports the region's 'BBB-' 
IDRs, which are higher than the region's intrinsic credit profile. Fitch will 
closely monitor liquidity support from the central government to Spanish 
regions. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Institutional Framework (Neutral/Stable)

Valencia's IDRs are based on Fitch's expectation of state support, as captured 
by the 'BBB-' rating floor, which mitigates liquidity risk and reduces the 
likelihood of default. The support includes the absolute priority of debt 
servicing, by law as per article 135 of the Spanish Constitution; access to 
state liquidity mechanisms such as the Regional Liquidity Fund (FLA); the 
Financial Facility Fund; and the Budgetary Stability Law (BSL), which enforces 
fiscal discipline on local and regional governments. 

In Fitch's view, Valencia's access to the FLA will continue to ensure timely 
debt servicing in 2018 and in 2019. Eighty-five per cent of the regional 
government's outstanding direct debt at end-2017 was funded through the state 
support mechanisms, illustrating strong support from the central government. The 
central government ratified its financial support on 23 December 2014, 
introducing further measures to ease the debt burden of autonomous communities, 
including zero interest loans in 2015. As a result, interest costs for Valencia 
declined by EUR762 million between 2014 and 2017. 

Debt (Weakness/Stable)

At end-2017, direct debt increased to EUR43.6 billion (EUR41.3 billion in 2016), 
although the direct debt-to-current revenue ratio slightly improved  to 338.6% 
(354.4% in 2016). 

The region is entitled to receive in 2018 close to EUR5.5 billion from the FLA, 
sufficient to cover long-term debt redemptions of EUR4.9 billion, including 
EUR231 million for debt redemption in its public sector. In Fitch's rating case 
scenario, direct debt is expected to increase to over EUR44 billion-EUR44.5 
billion by end-2018. However, we expect its relative weight to current revenue 
to decline to 336%-338% in 2018 due to expected improvement in current revenue. 

As of end-2017, debt maturities for the next three years totalled EUR18 billion, 
representing 40% of outstanding direct debt. However, this is mitigated by a 
large part of debt being contracted through the state support mechanisms at 
subsidised interest rates. In January 2018, Valencia contracted EUR2.1 billion 
short-term debt, of which EUR1.2 billion was used in September 2018. 

Fiscal Performance (Weakness/Stable) 

Valencia's structurally negative current and operating balances since 2010, 
recurring overall budget deficits before debt repayment, high net overall risk 
and a weaker economic profile than Spain's, mean that the regional government's 
intrinsic credit profile is weaker than the IDRs indicate. 

Under Fitch's rating case scenario, the regional government's weak budget 
performance will be difficult to reverse in the near- to medium-term, unless 
there is a significant change in the current funding system. Valencia is 
under-funded compared with the average funding per capita of the 15 Spanish 
regions under the common regime and is reliant on reform to address this gap. 
Nevertheless, Valencia's 2017 deficit before debt variation shrank by EUR214 
million from 2016, largely due to EUR993 million more resources from the funding 
system. In 2018 and 2019, resources from the funding system will increase by a 
further EUR111 million and EUR337 million, respectively. 

Economy (Neutral/Stable)

Valencia has a weaker-than-average economic profile, with a GDP per capita 11.8% 
below Spain's average in 2017, although this is in line with international 
standards. However, Valencia's GDP grew 4% in 2017 (4% in Spain) to an estimated 
nominal EUR108.8 billion. The elderly represent a high share of Valencia's 4.9 
million population, which may put pressure on health and social services. The 
labour market has improved as job creations rose 15% between December 2013 and 
August 2018, after 21% of jobs were lost during 2007-2013. However, at 18.2% in 
2017, the regional unemployment rate remains slightly higher than the national 
rate (17.2%).

Management (Weakness/Stable)

The coalition government, formed between the socialist party Partido Socialista 
del Pais Valenciano and the left party Compromis, has expressed willingness to 
comply with deficit stability goals. In 2017, Valencia posted an overall fiscal 
deficit of 0.8% of GDP, slightly above the 0.6% fiscal deficit goal set by the 
central government for the year, but an improvement from the 1.5% recorded in 
2016. However, Fitch notes that  actual revenue and expenditure tend to differ 
substantially from the  figures approved in the budget. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

As Valencia's IDRs are supported by the 'BBB-' rating floor for Spanish 
autonomous communities, they would be downgraded by at least two notches if the 
floor is removed. 

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch assumes that the state will continue providing support to Spanish regions 
over the medium term, in particular, through the liquidity mechanism. Moreover, 
Fitch will review the rating floor if state support measures are withdrawn or if 
the central government's ability and willingness to provide extraordinary 
support to the regions deteriorates.

Discussions on the regional financial system are ongoing in Spain, and changes 
are in prospect over the medium term. Nevertheless, Fitch believes Valencia's 
revenue is unlikely to decrease as a result.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Warsaw/London-October 19: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Polish 
Region of Mazowieckie's Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default 
Ratings (IDR) at 'A-' and Long-Term National Rating at 'AA+(pol)'. The Outlooks 
are Stable. Fitch has also affirmed Mazowieckie's senior unsecured debt 
long-term foreign currency rating at 'A-'.

The affirmation reflects our unchanged expectations that the region's budgetary 
performance and liquidity will remain solid and that regional direct debt will 
decline over the medium term. The ratings also reflect the region's high 
indirect risk, driven by significant and ongoing financing requirements of the 
healthcare sector, which we do not expect to decrease in the medium term.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fiscal Performance - Strength/Stable: Our projections continue to show that the 
region will post strong operating performance with operating margins at around 
20%-25% in the medium term. This will be supported by control of operating costs 
(precautionary programme in place) and by the expected growth of corporate 
income tax (CIT) revenue. CIT is the region's most important revenue source 
(60%-76% of operating revenue) and dependent on the national economy. In October 
2018 Fitch revised its GDP growth forecast for Poland to 4.8% for 2018 from 
4.4%. On the back of economic expansion we expect the region to report about 12% 
higher CIT revenue (PLN2.3 billion).

We forecast the region's operating balance to reach PLN800 million for 2018 
(2017: PLN727 million) and cover annual debt service more than 3x. It will also 
translate into a higher contribution by the region to the equalisation system in 
2019-2020 as payments will be calculated based on 2017-2018 tax revenue. From 
2019 we expect the operating balance to be lower but to cover debt service by at 
least 2x.

Debt, Liabilities & Liquidity - Strength/Stable: The region's debt has been 
declining since 2014. We forecast that it will decline to about PLN900 million 
at end-2021 from an expected PLN1 billion at end-2018. It will be driven by bond 
redemptions (PLN239 million outstanding at end-June 2018) and low new debt 
pressure from planned investments. We project the region's debt payback ratio 
(debt-to-current balance) to remain at below two years (2018: expected 1.4 
years). 

The region is exposed to foreign currency risk as over 40% of its debt stock at 
end-June 2018 was euro-denominated (bonds and loan from Council of Europe 
Development Bank). We expect the region's foreign currency exposure to fall to 
20% of the debt stock by end-2019 due to bond redemptions. Cash in Mazowieckie's 
accounts was PLN394 million in January-September 2018, compared with PLN417 
million in January-September 2017.

Indirect risk stemming from the region's shareholdings (including healthcare 
units) remains high, driven by ongoing substantial financial support (capital 
injections, guarantees and loans) for the financially weak healthcare sector. We 
project that in the medium term, as in the past, the region's financial support 
for healthcare units could reach PLN150 million annually. In contrast, the 
strong financial health of the region's railway companies, which have the most 
debt within the region's shareholdings (about 60% of total indirect risk), 
allows them to service their own debt. This is due to the long-term service 
contracts signed with the region for the provision of regional passenger railway 
services.

Economy - Strength/Stable: Mazowieckie's gross regional product per capita (the 
region has over five million inhabitants) was 160% of the national average and 
109% of the EU-28 average in 2016. The unemployment rate was 5.1% at end-July 
2018, below Poland's average (5.9%). The region is characterised by strong 
differences in economic development within its sub-regions. To maintain access 
of the less developed regions to EU grants under the next budgeting period, the 
region has been statistically divided into two NUTS 2 units from 2018. 

Management & Administration - Neutral/Stable: Mazowieckie's administration has 
to ensure compliance with the precautionary programme introduced in 2014, 
limiting spending and indebtedness. The biggest challenge facing the 
administration is the financially weak healthcare sector as well as acceleration 
of infrastructure investments that were curbed in 2012-2014. 

Institutional Framework - Neutral/Stable: The regulatory regime for Polish local 
and regional governments (LRGs) is fairly stable. Their activities and financial 
statements are closely monitored and reviewed by the central administration. 
LRG's finances are public and LRGs are obliged to disclose their financial 
accounts on time and in detail. The main revenue sources such as income tax 
revenue and transfers and subsidies from the central government are centrally 
distributed according to a legally defined formula, which limits the central 
government's scope for discretion.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The ratings could be upgraded if the region's net overall risk falls below 70% 
of current revenue (2018: 68% on a preliminary basis) and if the region 
maintains strong operating performance with an operating margin above 20%, 
provided the sovereign's IDRs are also upgraded.

Mazowieckie's ratings could be downgraded if net overall risk exceeds 120% of 
current revenue on a sustained basis along with material deterioration in 
operating performance.

Cyprus's credit ratings to BBB- from BB+, the second ratings
agency in the space of little over a month to pull the island
back into investment grade territory after a bailout in 2013.
    The outlook was stable, Fitch said in a news release.
    The agency said Cyprus is benefiting from a strong economic
recovery with real gross domestic product (GDP) reaching
pre-crisis levels, and forecast the economy would grow 4 percent
in 2018 and 3.8 percent in 2019. It was supported by large
foreign-financed investment projects in construction and
tourism, and robust private consumption, Fitch said.
    Fitch said it expected the island to record a fiscal surplus
of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2018, and 2.4 percent next year.
    ""Cyprus's ratings are supported by a high level of GDP per
capita, strong governance indicators and a favourable business
environment significantly above 'BBB' rated peers' and closer to
'A' category peer levels,"" Fitch said.
    However it said that the banking sector was still
vulnerable, with ""very weak asset quality and high NPEs
(non-performing exposures) ratios are still weighing on new
lending and profitability.""
    It noted that important legislative amendments aimed at
facilitating NPEs securitisation and sales of loans, and
strengthening foreclosure and insolvency toolkits were adopted
by the Cypriot parliament in July.
    Fiscal slippage and heavy exposure of two key banks to
indebted Greece forced Cyprus into accepting an international
bailout worth up to 10 billion euros in 2013. The bailout was
contingent on Cyprus winding down one bank, Laiki, and
converting a portion of unsecured deposits in another bank, Bank
of Cyprus, to equity in a process known as a 'bail-in'.
    Last month Standard and Poor's upgraded Cyprus out of junk
territory to BBB-.

    ATHENS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive
has approved Greece's first post-bailout draft budget without
requiring the implementation of legislated pension cuts, the
Greek prime minister said on Saturday.
    Athens emerged from its final international bailout in
August and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pushed to rescind
unpopular pension cuts slated for January as part of austerity
measures, claiming there is ample fiscal space to do so.
    Trailing the conservative opposition in polls, Tsipras is
counting on a less austere budget to win over voters next year,
when his term expires.
   ""The European Commission approved the Greek budget without
pension cuts after eight years of austerity,"" Tsipras said,
calling the development a ""success"".
    There was no immediate comment from the EU's executive.
    The government has argued it does not need to implement the
pension cuts agreed with creditors, as it aims to outperform on
primary surplus targets for a fifth straight year.
    Greece has promised its euro zone lenders and the
International Monetary Fund it will achieve a 3.5 percent of GDP
primary budget surplus this year, excluding debt servicing
outlays. 
    In its draft 2019 budget it targets a surplus of 4.14
percent of GDP next year. If it does not apply the pension cuts
it puts the figure at 3.56 percent. [nL8N1WH601]
    The draft budget projects economic growth will pick up to
2.5 percent in 2019 from an expected 2.1 percent this year.
    The government is now expected to submit its final draft
next month and put it on a parliamentary vote in December.

    ATHENS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras on Saturday welcomed the  approval by Macedonia's
parliament of a proposed change to the country's name as a
decisive step towards ending decades of discord between the two
neighbours.
    Macedonia's parliament approved the proposed new name of 
Republic of North Macedonia on Friday after a referendum last
month failed to reach the minimum participation threshold.
    The move could unblock Macedonia's bids to join NATO and the
European Union, long blocked by Greece, which argues that
""Macedonia"" implied territorial claims to a Greek province of
the same name. [nL8N1WZ6C3]
    The proposal still has to jump through further hoops of
approval, including passage in Greece's parliament despite the
hostility of the Greek defence minister to be formally adopted.
    ""Today is a symbolic and historic day for our foreign policy
after yesterday's decision at the Skopje's parliament which
opens the way for the implementation of an historic accord,""
Tsipras said at a ceremony to take charge of the foreign affairs
portfolio.
    He said implementation of the accord would also allow the
small Balkan state to join international organisations,
referring to the European Union and NATO.
    Tsipras has taken on the foreign minister role after Nikos
Kotzias, Greece's main negotiator in talks that led to the deal,
stepped down following a row with Defence Minister Panos
Kammenos at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. [nL8N1WX4EC]
    Kammenos is head of the co-ruling right-wing Independent
Greeks party, which with Tsipras's leftist Syriza party has a
slim majority in Greece's parliament. 
    He has called the Macedonia deal a national sell-out and has
threatened to resign if it comes before the Greek parliament.
    In a long dispute with its neighbour, Greece has insisted on
the name change because it views the name Macedonia as implying
a territorial claim on a northern Greek region of the same name
and an attempt to hijack ancient Greek civilization.
    In announcing Kotzias's resignation on Wednesday, Tsipras
said he would no longer tolerate ""double speak"" among members of
his cabinet, in a barb thought to be directed towards Kammenos.
[nL8N1WX4EC]
    In a Twitter post on Friday, Kammenos implied backhanders
played a role in the Macedonian approval of the name change. 
    ""Who would have thought that in Europe of values and
democracy those who do not vote according to instructions are
jailed, and those who comply get a 2 million euro bonus in black
money,"" he tweeted after the Macedonian parliament's vote.
    He did not elaborate and there has been no reaction to the
comment from Tsipras or the Macedonian government.

    By Valentina Za
    MILAN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Italy's ruling coalition patched
up a row over a tax amnesty on Saturday and struck a more
conciliatory tone towards EU institutions, saying it wanted to
discuss its budget plans with Brussels.
    The coalition included the tax amnesty in measures to fund
costly electoral promises that are set to sharply lift the
budget deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output next year,
flouting European Union rules that require steady progress
towards a balanced budget.
    Earlier this week, Italy brushed off criticism from Brussels
after the Commission stepped up pressure over a draft budget it
labelled an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU rules. [nL8N1WZ16J]
    But speaking after a cabinet meeting that settled the
amnesty dispute, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said
Italy had ""a comfortable place"" in Europe.
    ""We acknowledge European institutions as our counterparties
(over budget matters) ... we'll sit down around a table for a
constructive and peaceful dialogue,"" Conte told a news
conference.
    He said he would visit EU Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker in the near future to discuss the issue.
    Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini,
head of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right
League respectively, both reiterated Italy's commitment to the
single currency.
    ""We're well in Europe. There isn't and there won't be any
plan to leave the euro or the European Union,"" Salvini said.
    Salvini had rebuffed criticism over the budget earlier this
week, saying the Commission was ""a bunker under siege whose days
are counted,"" in reference to next spring's European elections.
    The government's free-spending plans prompted a credit
downgrade by Moody's on Friday, which cut Italy's sovereign debt
rating to one notch above junk status. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    Data released the same day showed foreign investors have
reduced their holdings of Italian government bonds by 67 billion
euros since May when markets first got wind of the coalition's

    The League and the 5-Star Movement, the two parties in the
coalition, had been at odds over widening the proposed tax
amnesty to shield financial criminals, including money
launderers.
    Di Maio had accused the League of tricking its coalition
partner by surreptitiously broadening the scope of the amnesty
in the final draft of the 2019 budget. He said on television he
was ready to go to the magistrates over the incident.
    But Salvini offered to drop the measure and a compromise was
hammered out at a coalition meeting on Saturday, followed by a
cabinet meeting that approved the law decree.
    ""Three surreal days are coming to an end ... it's been a bit
tiring but all's well that ends well,"" Salvini said.
    The 5-Star has opposed tax amnesties in the past but they
are popular with the League's voter base, which traditionally
comprises self-employed businessmen. 
    Italy, which suffers from high rates of tax evasion, has
often resorted to tax amnesties to raise money.

Raab wants the European Union to accept assurances that the
country will remain tied to the bloc's rules for longer in
return for making a hotly contested so-called backstop for
Northern Ireland unnecessary.
    Talks between Britain and the European Union have stalled
over a disagreement over the backstop - an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions, if a
future trading relationship is not in place in time.
    Raab writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said
Britain's proposal to extend its Brexit transition period should
be an ""alternative"" to the insurance plan.
    ""The Prime Minister has rightly refused to rule out
considering different approaches – including extending the
implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as
an alternative to the backstop,"" he said.
    But so far the European Union has said the backstop on the
island of Ireland must remain in place to proceed with the
divorce negotiations.

Scholz has proposed a global minimum rate of corporation tax
coupled with tougher measures to prevent tax evaders from
stashing their profits in tax havens, newspaper Welt am Sonntag
reported.
    In a guest article for the Sunday paper, extracts from which
were made available on Saturday, Scholz fleshed out proposals
that he was considering jointly with France to make it harder
for international firms to evade tax.
    Both countries are seeking ways to ensure that firms like
Amazon <AMZN.O>, Apple <AAPL.O> and Google <GOOGL.O> pay
domestic taxes in proportion to the profits they earn in
Europe's largest markets, though attempts to harmonise tax rates
across the European Union have met stiff resistance from
lower-tax members like Ireland.
    ""We need a worldwide minimum tax level that no state may go
below,"" Scholz said in the article, adding that any such rules
would need to be accompanied by measures to make it harder to
move money into tax havens.
    Scholz said the internet economy ""was exacerbating a problem
that we recognise from globalisation and that we are trying to
address: the placing of profits in low-tax locations.""
    Germany, Europe's largest consumer market, is particularly
fertile ground for U.S.-based internet giants, many of which
have used offshore structures to minimise their tax exposure to
what remains a relatively high-tax economy.

    By Pawel Florkiewicz and Pawel Sobczak
    WARSAW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Poles vote in a regional election
on Sunday with gains expected for the ruling Law and Justice
(PiS) party, whose nationalist rhetoric and institutional
reforms have put the country at loggerheads with the European
Union.
    PiS swept into power in 2015 on a promise of voter-pleasing
welfare reforms, social conservatism and a bigger state role in
the economy. The party remains broadly popular, despite
accusations at home and abroad of a shift towards authoritarian
rule.
    The election is part of a larger struggle over Europe's
future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban - who like the PiS
believes the EU's powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc
and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
    While it dominates national politics, PiS controls only a
small minority of city halls, and has a majority in only one
provincial assembly out of 16.
    If successful in gaining seats, PiS will have better access
to local funding, a factor that could affect parliamentary
elections in 2019. It will also have more influence over schools
and theatres, important tools in the party's nationalist agenda.
    PiS opposes abortion, contraception and IVF fertility
treatment and wants culture and education to be more
conservative.
    At two polling stations in Warsaw, early turnout appeared
modest, but voters were expected in greater numbers after church
services ended.
    PiS supporter Urszula, 68, who cast her ballot early, said:
""It is important that those who rule locally help those who are
in the government, so that their effect is bigger.""      
    A spike in PiS support in cities, traditionally centrist
strongholds, would show its brand of populism gaining broader
appeal and would be a major upset for the Civic Platform, the
home party of European Council President Donald Tusk. 
    Opinion polls show PiS could win 33-37 percent of votes for
provincial assembly members. A coalition of centrist opposition
parties, the Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, is forecast to get
about 24 percent. Post-election coalitions could affect how many
assemblies PiS will control.
    In mayoral elections, the centrist candidate in Warsaw,
Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, is seen winning 41-42 percent of vote on
Sunday, and securing the office in a second round of voting on
Nov. 4, beating PiS' Patryk Jaki, 33.
        
    'HEADING OUT OF THE EU'?
    Voting ends at 9:00 p.m. and exit poll results are expected
shortly afterwards.
    A good result for PiS would add to concerns in Brussels
ahead of European Parliament elections in May by boosting 
eurosceptic groups that oppose moves within the bloc towards
closer integration.
    Underlining divisions, the EU's top court ordered the Warsaw
government on Friday to suspend an overhaul of the country's
Supreme Court and reinstate judges forced into early retirement.
[nL8N1WZ4G7]
    The moves were part of broader reforms of the judiciary,
which PiS says are crucial to making the system more fair and
efficient, but opponents criticise as an attack on democratic
checks and balances.
    Throughout his campaign, Warsaw's mayoral candidate Jaki has
said he sides with ordinary people against what he describes as
an arrogant Civic Platform municipal elite.
    Trzaskowski, a long-time EU emissary for his party, says he
wants his native Warsaw to remain ""open, tolerant and European"".
    On Wednesday he accused the PiS-run justice ministry, where
Jaki is a deputy minister, of following ""a straight road towards
taking Poland out of the EU.""
    Joanna, 69, who voted for Trzaskowski, said he had a better
understanding of local problems than Jaki. 
    ""I have granddaughters who I take care of, but I am worried
about their future, as I do not know what will be with Poland in
Europe with this government,"" she said.

Michel Barnier stood firm on the need for checks on goods
shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit,
while insisting this would not amount to a new border, in an
interview published on Sunday.
    Negotiations on Britain's departure from the European Union
are stalled on several issues, but primarily an Irish 'backstop'
both sides agree is needed to avoid a hard border between the UK
province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, an EU
state.
    Brussels insists that this in turn requires controls on
goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland, and is
trying to overcome objections from among UK Prime Minister
Theresa May's Conservatives and the Northern Ireland Unionists
crucial to her government's parliamentary majority. [nB5N1O400Y]
    ""Contrary to what some are saying, this is not a border we
are creating in the Irish Sea to undermine the integrity of the
United Kingdom,"" Barnier told Le Journal du Dimanche.
    Veterinary checks are already conducted on 10 percent of
livestock transported to Northern Ireland from the rest of the
UK, Barnier said. This would increase to 100 percent under the
backstop, he added, but a later animal-health agreement could
reduce the proportion inspected to 40 percent.
    Barnier said other backstop measures were needed to prevent
unauthorised Irish imports of goods such as chlorinated chicken,
produced in the U.S. but outlawed by EU food standards.
    He said other issues still preventing a deal include the
demand by Brussels that the European Court of Justice should
have jurisdiction over its implementation - as well as Britain's
reluctance to address registered designations of origin for
foodstuffs, such as champagne or Roquefort cheese.

    LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Britain could accept extending
the post-Brexit transition period by a few months if the
European Union drops its proposals for a so-called Northern
Irish backstop, Britain's Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on
Sunday.
    Talks between Britain and the EU have stalled largely over a
disagreement on the backstop - an insurance policy to ensure
there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
    The Brexit transition, or implementation period, in which
Britain would retain EU rules and so avoid border problems with
Ireland, is due to end in December 2020.
    ""If we need a bridge from the end of the implementation
period to the future relationship ... I am open minded about
using a short extension of the implementation period,"" Raab told
BBC TV.
    ""It is an obvious possible route as long as it is short,
perhaps a few months, and secondly that we know how we get out
of it and obviously it has to solve the backstop issue so that
that falls away then as a possibility.""
    In an interview published on Sunday, EU chief Brexit
negotiator Michel Barnier stood firm on the need for checks on
goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland after
Brexit, but insisted this would not amount to a new border.
[nL8N1X10IC] 
    Britain says the EU's backstop proposal of keeping Northern
Ireland in its customs union is unacceptable as it would create
a border in the Irish Sea. It favours a backstop in which the
whole of Britain would stay inside the customs union but says it
must be time-limited period or have a clear exit mechanism.
    France's Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau said the EU was
still waiting for ""a workable solution"" from London.
    ""We have to have a definite answer, or at least no temporary
measures which disappear and we don’t know what to do after
that,"" she told BBC TV.    
    
    ""LAST CHANCE SALOON""  
    The possibility of extending the transition, keeping Britain
under EU governance with no say in it, is highly unpopular with
hardline supporters of Brexit and after Prime Minister Theresa
May signalled it as a possibility this week, her critics used
the Sunday newspapers to step up their attacks.
    The Sunday Times reported an ally of former Brexit minister
David Davis, who some see as an interim leader if May goes, as
saying the British leader was entering ""the killing zone"", while
it quoted an unnamed possible successor as saying ""assassination
is in the air"".
    The Mail on Sunday reported lawmakers from May's
Conservatives said she was in the ""last chance saloon"" and
should ""bring her own noose"" when she addresses Conservative
lawmakers at a meeting in parliament on Wednesday.
    A vote of no confidence in May would be triggered if 48
Conservative's lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the
party's so-called ""1922 committee"" of backbenchers demanding
such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent.
    ""We are at the end stage of the negotiation. I think it is
understandable there are jitters on all sides of this debate, we
need to hold our nerve, the end is in sight in terms of a good
deal ... I think colleagues should wait and see what that looks
like,"" said Raab. ""Now is the time to play for the team.""
    Raab said he did not know when he would next be going to
Brussels to negotiate, but a deal needed to be done by the end
of November in order to get the legislation through parliament.
    Opposition Labour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said
that even if a deal was agreed before Christmas it may not last.
    ""This idea that there will be a settlement, the issue will
be over,"" he said. ""What we are going to see is even if there is
a deal the Tory (Conservative) Party will try to rip it up next
year ... they will not stop fighting about this.""

tell parliament on Monday that 95 percent of Britain's divorce
deal has now been settled but will repeat her opposition to the
European Union's proposal for the land border with Northern
Ireland.
    Facing some of the fiercest criticism to date over her
Brexit plans after the two sides failed again to reach agreement
at a summit last week, May will try to calm passions in
parliament where her strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU
supporters alike.
    With just over five months until Britain leaves the EU,
talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern
Irish backstop, an insurance policy to ensure there will be no
return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future
trading relationship is not agreed in time. 
    But May's attempt to unlock the talks by considering an
extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current
proposed end date of December 2021 has further stirred passions
at home.
    In an attempt to highlight how much progress has been made
in more than a year of talks with the EU, she will tell
parliament the government has reached agreement on everything
from Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks.
    ""Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal
Agreement and its protocols are now settled,"" she will say,
according to excerpts from her statement to parliament.
    ""The shape of the deal across the vast majority of the
Withdrawal Agreement is now clear.""
    But the withdrawal agreement, or the terms of Britain's
divorce, cannot be signed off until the two sides agree on the
Northern Irish backstop. 
    At an EU summit last week, any such agreement seemed just as
far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and
diplomats saying May had offered nothing new to unlock the
talks. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    Since then, May's proposal to extend the transition period
has done little to calm anger among eurosceptics in the
governing Conservative Party, who fear she is leading Britain
into a deal that will make Britain a ""vassal state"" -- unable
ever to leave the EU. 
    On Sunday, Brexit minister Dominic Raab pushed the
suggestion forward, saying London could accept such a move if
the EU dropped its proposal for the backstop, which May says
would tear Northern Ireland from mainland Britain. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    May will repeat her opposition to the EU proposal - for
Northern Ireland to remain in the bloc's customs union,
potentially creating barriers to trade with the rest of Britain
- as she tries to ease growing frustration among her
parliamentary partners, a Northern Irish party.
    ""As I set out last week, the original backstop proposal from
the EU was one we could not accept, as it would mean creating a
customs border down the Irish Sea and breaking up the integrity
of the UK,"" she will say.
    ""I do not believe that any UK Prime Minister could ever
accept this. And I certainly will not.""

    LAS VEGAS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Marqeta, a U.S. financial
technology startup that helps young companies including
digital-only banks issue payment cards, has expanded into
Europe, the company said on Sunday.
    The company will service the region from London, where it
has hired at team of five and signed up new clients, it said.
    Backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> and Visa Inc <V.N>,
Marqeta has developed a platform that it says makes payment card
issuing and processing simpler and more efficient for
businesses.
    It is expanding in Europe through its partnership with Visa.
    Marqeta's U.S. clients include some of the most well-known
new entrants in finance such as Square Inc <SQ.N>, the payments
company founded by Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> CEO Jack Dorsey, and
Affirm, the lending startup led by PayPal Holdings Inc <PYPL.O> 
co-founder Max Levchin. It also works with Alipay, the payments
business spun out of China-based technology company Alibaba
Group Holding <BABA.N>. 
    Britain and the rest of Europe are a promising market
because of the growing cohort of young digital-only banks and
fintech startups based there, Marqeta's founder and CEO Jason
Gardner said in an interview at an industry conference in Las
Vegas.
    ""We have invested an enormous amount of resources in tech
and operations, and have been quietly building a presence
there,"" Gardner said.
    While the company plans to open another office somewhere
else in the region, Gardner said the UK's decision to leave the
European Union had not been a concern when picking its first
base in Europe.
    New entrants in the banking and payments market, such as
financial technology startups and challenger banks, have
acquired a larger share of industry revenues in the UK than
their counterparts in the U.S. and the rest of Europe, according
to a report by Accenture.
     In the UK new entrants have secured 14 percent of the total
€206 billion ($238.45 billion)in industry revenues, compared to
the 3.5 percent the total $1.04 trillion captured in the U.S.,
according to the report. [nL2N1WW1T7] 
    Founded in 2010, Marqeta has raised a total of $116 million
in venture capital,  most recently in a round led by Iconiq
Capital with participation from Goldman Sachs. [nL2N1T31WN]

    PARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The European Commission does not
want any crisis with Italy over its budget plans, but it expects
answers to its concerns,   European Economic Affairs
Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Monday.
    An Italian government source said that Rome was expecting
the EU executive to take the unprecedented step to ask it to
revise its 2019 draft budget, which includes lifting the deficit
to 2.4 percent of GDP from 1.8 percent in 2018 [nL8N1X10UW].
    ""The European Commission does not want a crisis between
Brussels and Rome,"" Moscovici told France Inter radio. ""My state
of mind is that of constructive dialogue.""
    Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Monday that the
Italian government was ready to discuss its budget targets with
European Union authorities [nR1N1VZ022].   
    The Italian government is expected to send a letter on its
budget to the Commission by noon. Moscovici said the European
Commission would meet on Tuesday to discuss the response, adding
that he could not say when it would take a decision.
    ""When you are an EU member and a member of the single
currency, of the euro zone, you must respect a number of joint
rules,"" Moscovici said, reaffirming the concerns the EU
executive has expressed over the past weeks on Italy's budget
plans. Italy's structural deficit is way too high, he said.
    Moscovici, a French Socialist, said he was making a
difference between Salvini's political ideas, which he disagrees
with, and the Italian government, which he says he respects.
    ""I can fight Mr Salvini as party chief; I can fight his
ideas; I can consider that, he also belongs to the illiberal
democracy space. After all he is Mrs Le Pen's friend, let's not
forget this,"" he said, referring to the French far-right leader.
    ""I fight the National Front and I fight the League on a
political level, but I respect the Italian government. And it
must also respect EU rules,"" he said. ""It is mutual respect that
allows us to move forward in this diverse Europe.""

    * Macronometer graphic package: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JH3um9
    * Employment and business creations at record levels
    * Household income boost expected from tax cuts
    * French competitiveness yet to show improvement

    By Leigh Thomas
    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - While France has experienced
political turbulence and disappointing economic data in recent
months, beneath the surface are signs of deeper change that
suggest President Emmanuel Macron's reform drive is starting to
bear fruit.
    For much of this year, the 40-year-old president and former
investment banker has had to endure less-than-thrilling news on
the economic front, with consumer and business confidence
wilting and the growth outlook souring.
    But looking past those lacklustre short-term indicators,
employment and new business creations are at record levels and a
purchasing power boost is around the bend.
    Together, they are evidence of more meaningful, structural
economic changes afoot that might one day, albeit not yet, help
to stem a long-term decline in France's export competitiveness.
    ""There are some shifts that are starting to crop up,"" said
economist Denis Ferrand, managing director of the Rexecode think
tank, pointing in particular to a surge in the employment rate.
    At nearly 66 percent, the proportion of people in work has
reached the highest level in records going back to late 2003,
which Ferrand said was an indication the economy's growth
potential was shifting up a gear.
    While Rexecode's growth forecast of 1.3 percent next year is
lower than the government's estimate of 1.7 percent, Ferrand's
colleagues believe that, over time, Macron's reforms will add
0.2-0.3 percentage points to annual growth.
    
    VOTERS FRUSTRATED
    Macron has promised pro-business reforms that boost
investment and jobs. But voters have grown restless in the face
of such slow growth.
    His sometimes brash leadership style, and the desertion of
several key ministers that triggered a messy reshuffle this
week, have only added to their sense of frustration.
    Yet despite such headline-grabbing setbacks, the labour
market appears to be growing stronger, even though the
unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 8.7 percent.
    People are not only getting jobs but also increasingly
signing long-term contracts, once shunned by employers who
feared they would not be able to lay workers off if business
declined.
    An overhaul of the labour code last year sought to address
such worries by making it easier to both hire and fire.
    ""You can say what you want, but when you look at what he's
done in the last 18 months, he's been very active ... He went
after big issues, like the labour market,"" said economist
Jean-Herve Lorenzi, who runs the Cercle des Economistes forum.
    Strikingly, the youth unemployment rate is dropping, despite
the fact Macron's government is slashing the number of
subsidised jobs that tended to benefit young people in the past.
    Though still high, at over 20 percent, the rate is now the
lowest since late 2008, at the start of the financial crisis.
    
    NEW BUSINESSES BOOMING
    Macron has also cut taxes on companies and capital in a move
to boost investment, innovation and risk-taking.
    Right on cue, new business creations promptly soared, and
they show no signs of slowing despite the weaker economic
outlook. A record 59,700 new businesses were set up in
September, according to the INSEE official statistics agency.
    Lorenzi cautioned, however, that ""start-ups and industrial
innovation can't make up the economy as a whole"".
    While companies and the wealthy got a tax cut, many voters
feel left out, especially as they suffered social security and
petrol tax hikes at the start of the year. An inflation surge
further squeezed their finances.
    To counter accusations of ruling for the rich, Macron's
government is now focused on boosting household purchasing
power, always an issue in France's consumer-driven economy.
[nL8N1W33GI]    
    INSEE says a cut in payroll tax this month and a cut in
municipal tax next month should boost disposable income 1.7
percent in the last three months of the year, the strongest
quarterly increase in 16 years.
    But it remains clear that France still has a long way to go.
Its share of exports from the euro zone to the world has
stagnated at 12 percent, suggesting that Macron has made little
progress in reversing its long-term competitive decline. 
    ""The day we stabilise or even win back market share will be
a sign of real structural change,"" said Ferrand. ""But that's a
structural indicator that has yet to show up.""

    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares gained on Monday
amid relief over Italy's budget, following rallies in Asia after
China promised to provide stimulus to stabilise its economy and
offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.
    Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of
support for stock markets in the world's second-largest economy
saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three
years [nL3N1X206H][L3N1X21FI]. Shanghai blue chips <.CSI300>
jumped around 4.5 percent, adding to Friday's bounce on
Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. 
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere
in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains. <.HSI> <.MIAPJ0000PUS>
<.TWII>.     
    European stocks <.STOXX> opened higher after Moody's kept
Italy's sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of cutting it
to negative. The decision fuelled a rally in Italian government
bonds and boosted shares in the country's banks.
    ""Moody's opens the door for a euro bounce, while Chinese
verbal support for the economy and markets has given us a
risk-friendly mood to start the week,"" Societe Generale said in
a note to clients. 
    The mood looked to spill over into U.S. markets, where
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 <ESc1> were 0.4 percent higher
while Nasdaq's <NQc1> added 0.7 percent. 
    This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season,
with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the
companies reporting [nL2N1WY22W].
    Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P
500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the
third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
    ""The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being
'strong' and the vast majority of companies will exceed
consensus expectations,"" said analysts at JPMorgan in a note.
    ""However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form
of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all
the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a
turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.""
   The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the
first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who
cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial
conditions would trigger the next downturn [nL3N1WY2Q9].

    ITALIAN RELIEF
    On currency markets, the euro sailed higher <EUR=> against
the dollar after the Moody's report. It also benefited from
comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who
reiterated the country does not intend to leave the single
currency. 
    Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields
enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June. [nL8N1X216H]
    But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European
Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its
budget, possibly leading to sanctions. [nL8N1X10UW]
    The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday
to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first
time ever, a government source said on Sunday.
    Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European
Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain
to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about
its reinvestment policy until December [nL3N1WZ47X].
    The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies at 95.578 <.DXY> [USD/] while sterling idled at
$1.3081 <GBP=> as the market waited for more developments on
Brexit.
    Prime Minister Theresa May will tell parliament that 95
percent of Britain's divorce deal has now been settled. But she
will repeat her opposition to the EU's proposal for the land
border with Northern Ireland and many see the risk of a
leadership challenge being mounted [nL8N1X10YY].
    Saudi Arabia also remained in the spotlight after Riyadh
called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a ""huge and
grave mistake"" but sought to shield its powerful crown prince
from the crisis [nL8N1X10M8] [nL2N1X107K] [nL2N1X1068].
    U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders are pushing
Saudi Arabia for more answers. 
    In commodity markets, Brent crude futures <LCOc1> climbed
past op $80 per barrel, with U.S. sanctions against Iran's crude
exports due to be implemented next month. [O/N]
    Gold prices edged higher towards the 2 1/2-month peak hit
last week <XAU=> [nL3N1X21L0].

    Oct 22 (Reuters) - Emerging market equities rose on Monday
led by blue-chip Chinese stocks which rallied to their biggest
one-day gain in almost three years, while a weaker dollar
bolstered most developing market currencies, with South Africa's
rand firming 1 percent.
    Chinese stocks <.SSEC> <.CSI300> rose more than 4 percent,
extending Friday's gains, on the promise of more stimulus as
China revealed tax change measures to support the economy and
companies. [nL3N1WZ1AA]
    That helped MSCI's emerging market stock index <.MSCIEF>
gain more than 1 percent, with most stock markets from Taiwan
<.TWII> to South Africa <.JTOPI> moving higher.
    In a week that will see numerous central bank meetings, most
emerging market currencies also firmed against a largely weaker
dollar as the euro strengthened due to easing concern over
Italy.[FRX/]    
    ""We might have a bit more positive sentiment this week given
that we have had some of the big issues out of our way,"" said
Jakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske
Bank.    
    Emerging markets have been under pressure this year with
Chinese stocks down 19 percent, hit by the U.S.-China trade
stand-off, tensions with Saudi Arabia and the West and
uncertainly about the global growth outlook. 
    Among currencies, Turkey's lira <TRY=> weakened slightly,
and the Russian rouble <RUB=> firmed ahead of respective central
bank meetings later this week at which analysts expect interest
rates to be left unchanged. [nL8N1WZ5Q7] 
    South Africa's rand <ZAR=> climbed with attention focused on
its medium-term budget policy statement, which is due on
Wednesday. New Finance Minister Tito Mboweni will stick closely
to previous budget forecasts for the coming two fiscal years,
with only slight slippages due to poor revenues, economists
predicted in a Reuters poll. [nL8N1WW2TV]
    ""The focus will be on the balance between growth supporting
measures and debt sustainability. Therefore, we believe all the
attention would be on the structure of expenditures and
Treasury's economic growth forecasts,"" Credit Suisse analysts
said about the budget in a briefing note.
    Most Eastern European peers including the Polish zloty
<EURPLN=> and Czech crown <EURCZK=> steadied on news that
Moody's had kept Italian government's credit rating outlook at

1902,4587,8c24301380f1e1b3c645008e7ddfd645,German growth could rebound after weak Q3: Bundesbank,2018-10-22 18:00:02,EUR,0,2018-10-22 18:00:02,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    FRANKFURT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Germany's economy struggled in
the third quarter on a dip in car manufacturing but the drivers
of its recent expansion remain in place, so growth should
rebound in the final three months of the year, the Bundesbank
said on Monday.
    With the European Union implementing a new motor vehicle
emissions certification system, German auto makers struggled to
gain regulatory clearance while production was also dampened by
big dealership discounts to clear stock before the new rules
came into effect.
    Germany has been the engine of the euro zone's five-year
growth run and its recent wobbles have increased worries that
growth cycle may be coming to a premature end, before some
countries have had time to fully recover from the bloc's debt
crisis less than a decade ago.
    ""The economic upswing in Germany is still fundamentally
intact,"" the Bundesbank said in a regular monthly economic
report. 
    ""Business climate improved noticeably in the third quarter,
according to the Ifo Institute, so a significant expansion of
economic output is expected for the current quarter,"" the bank
added.
    Still, third quarter growth figures, due to be published in
mid-November, are likely to be sluggish as retail sales were
modest and construction output pulled back from earlier highs,
exacerbating the hit to growth from a big drop in industrial
production. 
    The car industry's struggles continued until the end of the
quarter but other segments of industry fared better and the
backlog of industrial orders also remained high, the Bundesbank
added.
    The German government recently cut its 2018 growth forecast
to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent and also lowered the 2019
projection to 1.8 percent from 2.1 percent, citing the impact of
global trade disputes, labour shortages and the auto sector’s
difficulties. [nL8N1WR30F]

    By Karin Strohecker and Tom Wilson
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares crept higher on
Monday on relief over Italy's budget, tracking rallies in Asia
markets after China promised to provide stimulus to stabilise
its economy and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.
    Promises of tax cuts and coordinated official statements of
support for stock markets in the world's second-largest economy
saw Chinese shares stage their biggest one-day surge in three
years [nL3N1X206H][L3N1X21FI]. Shanghai blue chips <.CSI300>
jumped around 4.3 percent, adding to Friday's bounce on
Beijing's pledge of support for the economy and companies. 
    Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.4 percent. Markets elsewhere
in Asia also enjoyed healthy gains. <.HSI> <.MIAPJ0000PUS>
<.TWII>.     
    European stocks <.STOXX> climbed 0.2 percent after Moody's
kept Italy's sovereign rating stable on Friday instead of
cutting it to negative. The decision fuelled a rally in Italian
government bonds and boosted shares in the country's banks.
[nL8N1X21L1]
    The Moody's report and China's verbal support for its
economy helped markets look beyond worries over the impact on
global growth from policy tightening by the Federal reserve and
the U.S.-China trade war, market participants said. 
    ""It looks like the Chinese authorities will do what they can
to stem the negative effects of those factors,"" said Investec
economist Victoria Clarke. 
    The mood was set to travel to U.S. markets, where E-Mini
futures for the S&P 500 <ESc1> were 0.1 percent higher. Nasdaq's
<NQc1> added 0.4 percent. 
    This week is the peak period of the U.S. earnings season,
with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Caterpillar among the
companies reporting [nL2N1WY22W].
    Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P
500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the
third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
    ""The season on an absolute basis will likely wind up being
'strong' and the vast majority of companies will exceed
consensus expectations,"" said analysts at JPMorgan in a note.
    ""However, headwinds are building at the margin in the form
of U.S. dollar strength, supply chain disruptions owing to all
the trade uncertainty, and rising costs. Even the mere hint of a
turn in profit fundamentals would have severe ramifications.""
    The outlook for global growth in 2019 has dimmed for the
first time, according to Reuters polls of economists, who
cautioned that the U.S.-China trade war and tightening financial
conditions would trigger the next downturn. [nL3N1WY2Q9]

    ITALIAN RELIEF
    On currency markets, the euro <EUR=> rallied after the
Moody's report before pairing gains. By late morning it was down
0.1 percent at $1.15. 
    The single currency has benefited from comments by Italian
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who reiterated the country
does not intend to leave the euro. 
    Bond yields dropped across the curve, with 10-year yields
enjoying their biggest one-day drop since the June. [nL8N1X216H]
    But later in the day, Italy must explain to the European
Commission its breach of rules. It faces the rejection of its
budget, a move that could lead to sanctions. [nL8N1X10UW]
    The government expects the commission to decide on Tuesday
to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, for the first
time ever, a government source said on Sunday.
    Italy is also expected to be on the agenda when the European
Central Bank meets on Thursday. The bank is considered certain
to keep policy on hold and is likely to put off discussion about
its reinvestment policy until December [nL3N1WZ47X].
    The dollar was up 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies
at 95.796 <.DXY> [USD/]

    ROME, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury told the European
Commission on Monday it would stick to its contested budget
plans in defiance of EU fiscal rules, but promised to intervene
if it failed to meet its debt and deficit goals.
    In a letter to the Commission, Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria said he recognised that the 2019 budget, which is set to
hike next year's fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), was not in line with the EU Stability and Growth
Pact. 
    However, he said the government had to respond to years of
economic underperformance, adding it did not intend to further
expand the budget deficit in 2020 and 2021.
    ""(The budget) was a hard, but necessary decision in light of
Italy's delay in catching up to pre-crisis levels of GDP and the
desperate economic conditions in which the most disadvantaged
citizens find themselves in,"" Tria wrote. 
    ""The government trusts that what it has explained is
sufficient to clear up the setup of its budget and that the
(fiscal) law will not put at risk the financial stability of
Italy or other EU state members,"" he added.
    The European Commission sent Rome a warning letter about the
budget last week -- the first formal step of a procedure that
could lead to Brussels rejecting the fiscal package and imposing
fines on Italy.
    An EU spokesman said on Monday that the European Commission
would discuss and decide on Tuesday the next steps in the
procedure for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget. [nB5N1VQ00I]

fiscal package, and predicted that growth would ""take off"" once
government reforms were implemented.
    He pledged that next year's deficit would not exceed 2.4
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and dismissed any
suggestion that Italy might have to abandon the euro currency or
leave the European Union.

    * Says industry woes may help union talks

 (Adds German VC union saying 'no real progress')
    By Conor Humphries
    DUBLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Ryanair <RYA.I> hopes to reach
deals with all of its major unions by Christmas, its chief
executive said on Monday, in a sign an end may be in sight to
disruptions which have hit its profit and shares.
    The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, on Monday
reported a 7 percent fall in profits in the six months to Sept.
30 on high fuel costs and intense competition. 
    But it said these factors were helping it to resolve its
industrial relations troubles.
    ""Given the adverse environment that's out there for airlines
and the number of job losses being reported in recent weeks both
by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common
sense approach being taken by the unions,"" Chief Executive
Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation. 
    O'Leary said that recent progress in talks left Germany and
Belgium as the only two large markets for the airline where
recognition agreements had not been secured. 
    ""We would be hopeful of concluding agreements with them this
side of Christmas,"" he added.
    The fall in profit was less than the 9 percent drop forecast
by analysts and Ryanair shares were 4.2 percent higher at 12.00
euros at 1100 GMT.
    Ryanair's shares are almost 40 percent down from a peak of
19.39 euros in August last year before the industrial relations
issues began. 
    A staff revolt forced management to recognise unions for the
first time last December and the airline has since struggled to
put in place union recognition agreements. 
    A spokesman for Belgium's LBC-NVK union said it was waiting
for an offer from Ryanair on Thursday and had warned the airline
they could strike again if there is no progress. 
    A spokesman for German unions VC said he saw ""no real
progress"" in talks with Ryanair, which also needs to secure
recognition deals in the Netherlands and Sweden. 
    On Friday it said it had reached agreement with British,
Portuguese and Italian pilots and was close to a deal with
Spanish pilots, although the British union said the deal had not
been approved by its members yet. [nL8N1WZ3YN]
    Ryanair issued a profit warning on Oct. 1 citing damage to
bookings from strikes and cutting its forecast for full-year
profit by 12 percent. [nL8N1WH1EH]
    But on Monday, O'Leary said much of the weakness of recent
weeks was sector-wide rather than specific to Ryanair. 
    Over-capacity in European short-haul will push Ryanair fares
down by 2 percent in the six months to March 31 compared to the
same period last year, O'Leary forecast. He warned he would not
rule out a 3 percent fall. 
    ""We are entering into a grim winter in terms of declining
air fares,"" he told an analyst conference call. ""But moving into
the summer of 2019 I would expect to see some upward traction on
pricing... following oil prices with a 12-month lag."" 
    Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer,
reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the
six months to Sept. 30, better than the 1.127 billion euros
forecast in a company poll of more than 10 analysts. 
($1 = 0.8685 euros)

watchdog, BaFin, said on Monday it would negotiate its own
regulatory ties with its British counterpart to avoid market
disruption if Britain and the European Union fail to reach
broader agreements before Brexit.
    EU financial regulators are hoping to agree multilateral
memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with Britain's Financial
Conduct Authority to avoid a disorderly Brexit wreaking havoc.
    But progress on that broader effort partly hinges on whether
and when Britain and the EU agree final terms of a divorce
settlement and the outline of future trading terms before Brexit
in March. An EU summit this month failed to secure agreement on
these.
    In the first sign that a national regulator in the EU was
leaving nothing to chance and is willing to go it alone, BaFin's
deputy president, Elisabeth Roegele, said the watchdog was
examining fall-back scenarios.
    Those could include a bilateral agreement between BaFin and
UK regulators to “ensure the smoothest possible transition,” she
said.    
    Britain and EU regulators are trying to agree deals on a
wide range of areas to allow funds in one country to be managed
by staff in another country, and to clear the way for other
forms of outsourcing and the transfer of risks between
operations in different countries.
    Roegele said EU and UK regulators should agree at an “early
stage” on a procedure for consultation, cooperation and exchange
of information in the field of securities trading.
    “Such a commitment to transparency, market integrity and
investor protection serves to ensure the smooth functioning of
financial markets and financial stability and to maintain the
necessary confidence of market participants, especially
investors,” she said in a statement.
    Banks have said that Brussels is dragging its feet on
agreeing regulatory cooperation agreements in order to pile
pressure on lenders to staff new hubs in the EU before March and
shift the contracts to them. [nL8N1WY722]
    The chairman of France's markets watchdog AMF, Robert
Ophele, had said that cooperation agreements for supervising
cross-border asset managers will be in place before Britain
leaves the European Union next March. 
    ""This type of MOU is very easy to write. We have them with
many many countries and they all look the same,"" he had
said.[nL8N1WH336]

    * Polish regional elections disappoint ruling party

    PRAGUE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Central European currencies
headed higher on Monday as markets took some relief from Italy
retaining a stable outlook from Moody's ratings agency after an
expected downgrade.
    Stock markets in the region also rallied, led by a 0.3
percent rise for Prague <.PX>. Budapest markets were closed for
a holiday though the forint <EURHUF=> gained 0.1 percent to
323.00 to the euro in trading.
    Investors had worried that Moody's would not only downgrade
Italy's sovereign rating to Baa3 - the lowest investment grade -
but also set the outlook at ""negative"", increasing the risk of a
junk rating for the euro zone's third largest economy.
    With central Europe tightly integrated economically and
investors watching for any market effects from Italy's tensions
with the European Union over Rome's expansionary budget
spending, the region was able to gain some ground.
    The Czech crown <EURCZK=> was out front with a 0.2 percent
rise to 25.832 to the euro at 1031 GMT, while Poland's zloty
<EURPLN=> added 0.1 percent to 4.292.
    ""The crown is more market-driven rather than reacting to
fundamentals at the moment,"" a Prague-based trader said.
    In Poland, investors digested regional elections over the
weekend in which exit polls showed the ruling eurosceptic Law
and Justice (PiS) party posted limited gains but lost a
high-profile race for Warsaw mayor. [nL8N1X104A]
    The result did not have a major impact on the market but may
be felt later in the government's fiscal policy, increasing
chances of a rise in spending down the line, analysts said.
    ""We see local election results as neutral for the FX and
bond market,"" Erste Group Bank analysts said in a note.
    ""Ahead of parliamentary elections we may see further
increase in social benefits as was the case in local
elections...especially if the ruling party considers the local
elections result as disappointing.""

    By Liam Proud and Antony Currie
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - KKR’s <KKR.N> $7.1
billion splurge on a Fiat Chrysler-owned supplier is sending
auto industry valuations into a spin. The buyout group is paying
16 times next year's earnings for Magneti Marelli, which will be
merged with KKR portfolio company Calsonic Kansei. That's double
what publicly traded car-parts peers are worth, according to
Refinitiv data. Meanwhile, shares of marquee manufacturers trade
at an even bigger discount. 
    Shareholders have reasons to be downbeat about the sector. A
slowdown in China and worries that new fuel-economy standards
will hurt demand in Europe have led to a number of profit
warnings in recent months from suppliers like Continental
<CONG.DE> and Michelin <MICP.PA>, paints specialist PPG
Industries <PPG.N>, and carmakers Daimler <DAIGn.DE> and BMW
<BMWG.DE>. 
    So it could be that KKR overpaid. In fact, its return on
invested capital may be as low as 10.7 percent by 2023 assuming
it cuts 300 million euros of costs – or 2 percent of combined
revenue – grows operating profit 3 percent a year and pays 28
percent in taxes. That's a humdrum return for a private-equity
deal, putting the onus on KKR and Calsonic to slash more
expenses, boost revenue or hunt for more deals. 
    The deal is certainly a coup for FCA Chief Executive Mike
Manley who took over both the company and negotiations with KKR
in July after his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne, fell ill and
later died. Manley now gets to choose how to divvy up the
proceeds between shareholders and investments in electric- and
autonomous-vehicle technology, where FCA lags. 
    Still, the vote of confidence from a typically savvy
investor contrasts with how public investors feel about the
sector. All the major carmakers trade well below 10 times
earnings. Daimler and General Motors <GM.N> now trades below six
times 2019 estimates, while FCA, Renault <RENA.PA> and
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> languish around five times. That suggests
shareholders reckon the bottom line will shrink drastically. 
    Worse still, it looks like investors are assuming some
carmakers will soon be worthless. FCA, for example, should
generate 10.5 billion euros of free cash flow in the next three
years, using Refinitiv estimates. Even if it shrinks by 5
percent a year after that, FCA would earn its current enterprise
value in free cash flow by 2027 at an 8 percent discount rate,
implying it has no value whatsoever after that point. That
already looked over-pessimistic. KKR is helping to make the
point.   
    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Calsonic Kansei on Oct. 22 said it has agreed to buy Fiat
Chrysler’s car-parts business Magneti Marelli for a total
transaction value of 6.2 billion euros. The Japanese auto
supplier, owned by private-equity group KKR, said its Chief
Executive Beda Bolzenius will lead the combined group. 
    - The sale is the first big decision for newly minted FCA
Chief Executive Mike Manley, who took over in July after
long-time boss Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died due to
complications from surgery. 
    - KKR bought Calsonic from Nissan and other shareholders in
2016. At the time, it said it would help Calsonic, which relies

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 22: Portugal's 2019 budget plan maintains the 
strong commitment to fiscal consolidation that has supported the country's 
sovereign credit profile, Fitch Ratings says. Some spending commitments reflect 
the approach of elections next year and legacy banking sector costs are still 
being felt in the debt dynamics, but the government aims to achieve a 
close-to-balanced budget. 

The draft budget targets a 2019 fiscal deficit of 0.2% of GDP, down from the 
0.7% forecast for this year. 0.2pp of the narrowing is due to cyclical growth, 
and 0.3pp represents the improvement in the structural deficit. The deficit 
forecast is unchanged from April's 2018-2022 Stability Programme. 

These targets are consistent with recent macroeconomic and fiscal developments 
supporting our view that gross general government debt (GGGD) is on a firm 
downward trend. While the cyclical economic recovery is slowing (as it is in the 
eurozone as a whole), continued growth and earlier fiscal tightening have 
supported consolidation. Tax revenues grew by 5.1% in January-August 2018 
compared with 2.2% expenditure growth in the same period , reducing the deficit 
by EUR1.4 billion to just EUR580 million. The government estimates that it will 
generate a primary surplus of 2.7% of GDP in 2018, rising to 3.1% in 2019. 

Narrower deficits and stronger growth have seen Portugal's GGGD ratio start to 
fall in the last two years. The prospect of further declines through the medium 
term was an important driver of our two-notch sovereign upgrade to 'BBB'/Stable 
last December. We see debt-to-GDP falling below 100% by 2027, from its 2014 peak 
of 130.6%. 

We noted the possibility of fiscal loosening in the run up to the next general 
election, due by October 2019, when we affirmed Portugal's sovereign rating in 
June. The budget plan suggests that the approaching election has not triggered a 
reversal in the minority Socialist government's fiscal stance. It envisages 
unfreezing civil service wages and an above-inflation increase in public sector 
pensions, as well as a scheme to subsidise transport costs for families in and 
around Oporto and Lisbon. 

Nevertheless, revenues should benefit from stronger tax collections and a 
reduction in tax evasion according to the government's plans. The absence of 
large populist/Eurosceptic parties in Portugal may limit political risks to 
consolidation. 

Banking sector recapitalisation costs continue to increase the public debt, 
although banks are recovering from the impact of the eurozone crisis and 
recession. One-off items in the 2019 draft budget include potential state 
contributions to the contingent capital mechanism of Novo Banco (the 'good bank' 
created from Banco Espirito Santo), should these be needed. This could have a 
maximum impact of adding EUR850 million to public debt in 2019 (0.45% of GDP), 
following the payment of EUR430 million in 2Q18. In total, stock-flow 
adjustments in 2019 amount to 1.4% GDP, also including a marked difference 
between the cash and accrual deficit. 

This is consistent with our view that one-off expenditures relating to the 
legacy of the banking and sovereign crises will continue, albeit in smaller 
amounts. The  headline  budget  deficit  in  2017  was  3%  of  GDP,  due to a 
large  one-off item - the recapitalisation of Caixa Geral de Depositos.

High general government debt and weak banks remain sovereign rating weaknesses, 
although the health of the banking sector is improving. Major Portuguese banks 
all returned to profitability in 2017 thanks to lower operating costs and loan 
impairment charges. Capitalization and asset quality have also improved. High 
non-performing loans remain a key weakness, although these have fallen from 
nearly 18% in 2016 to 12% at end-June through portfolio sales, write-offs and 
cures, and the economic recovery. We expect further falls in 2018-2019. 

Our next scheduled sovereign rating review is due on 30 November.

    * Amendment would in effect make EU's backstop plan illegal
    * DUP has no immediate comment on Telegraph report

 (Adds government comment, detail)
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Northern Irish party which
props up British Prime Minister Theresa May will back an
amendment proposed by rebel Brexiteer lawmakers that will
effectively make the European Union's backstop proposal illegal,
a Telegraph newspaper reporter said.
    Brexit talks have stalled over a disagreement on the
so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.
    May has rejected the EU's proposal - for Northern Ireland to
remain in the bloc's customs union - as it would potentially
create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain.
    Prominent Brexiteer Steve Baker, a former junior Brexit
minister, will try to block the EU's backstop plan on Wednesday
by attaching amendments to legislation passing through
parliament.
    Northern Ireland has been without a fully functioning
executive since January 2017, and Baker's amendment would
prevent officials acting in the absence of a devolved government
to implement any trade or regulatory barriers between Northern
Ireland and mainland Britain.    
    ""DUP will back amendment being tabled by Tory Eurosceptics
on Wednesday that will effectively make the EU’s NI backstop
illegal,"" Steven Swinford, the Telegraph's deputy political
editor, said on Twitter. 
    ""Yet another headache for No. 10, with 40 Tory MP already
poised to support it.""
    The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 lawmakers provide
May with a slim working majority in parliament, say the EU's
backstop proposal would tear Northern Ireland from the rest of
Britain. The DUP had no immediate comment on the report.
    Only seven Conservative lawmakers have to rebel for May to
lose a vote in parliament, if all opposition party lawmakers
vote against the government, so if 40 Conservatives backed the
amendment the DUP's decision would not sway the outcome.
    But the scale of votes against the government could provide
an indication of how many may ultimately refuse to back any
final Brexit deal with the EU when it is voted on in parliament.
    The Times reported that the opposition Labour Party was
likely to abstain on the amendment, however, meaning the
government would still win the vote. A spokesman for the Labour
Party said it would make a decision later on Monday.
    May's spokesman said the government would look at the
amendments ""in the usual way"". 
    ""It's worth pointing out the legislation's purpose: it is
necessary to provide the Northern Ireland civil service with the
certainty and clarity they need to continue to deliver public
services,"" he told reporters.

 (Adds deal multiple, analyst, BREAKINGVIEWS link, updates
shares)
    By Junko Fujita and Agnieszka Flak 
    TOKYO/MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan's Calsonic Kansei,
owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR <KKR.N>, has agreed to buy
Fiat Chrysler's <FCHA.MI> Magneti Marelli for 6.2 billion euros
($7.1 billion) to form the seventh-largest independent car parts
supplier.
    The first big deal by FCA's newly-appointed chief executive
Mike Manley, who took over in July after the sudden death of
long-time boss Sergio Marchionne, creates a company with revenue
of 15.2 billion euros ($17.5 billion), the companies said.
    The newly formed Magneti Marelli CK Holdings is likely to
cut costs through synergies and expand its customer base as
components makers try to keep up with a shift by carmakers into
autonomous driving, connected cars and electric vehicles.
    ""This combination with Calsonic Kansei has emerged as an
ideal opportunity to accelerate Magneti Marelli's future
growth,"" Manley said on Monday of the FCA unit, which
specialises in lighting, powertrain and high-tech electronics. 
    FCA shares were up 3.6 percent at 1358 GMT as investors
welcomed the hefty price tag, which will boost FCA's net cash
position, raise expectations of a share buyback and pave the way
for dividend payments the carmaker promised under its new
five-year strategy plan unveiled in June.[nL5N1T31MQ] 
    It will also help FCA pay for much needed investments in
hybrid and electric cars in order to remain compliant with
stricter future emissions regulations in the EU and elsewhere.
    ""Getting this transaction completed at the price agreed is a
significant early milestone and accomplishment,"" George
Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said of Manley and his
team's ability to match Marchionne's deal-making reputation.
        
    GLOBAL AMBITION
    Marchionne had set in motion a process to spin off the unit
and distribute its shares to FCA shareholders by early 2019, but
said in June that FCA would still be ""receptive"" to an offer.
    Neither FCA nor its top shareholder, Fiat's founding Agnelli
family, will have a stake in the combined business but FCA said
it would enter into a multi-year agreement to secure supplies to
its plants and also to maintain operations and staff in Italy.
    KKR bought Calsonic from Nissan and other shareholders in
2016, saying it would help the parts maker, which relies on the
Japanese carmaker for most of its sales, to expand globally.
    Calsonic has been in talks with FCA for months and made an
initial 5.8 billion euro bid, sources have said. [nL8N1W7400]
    FCA does not break out earnings for Magneti Marelli, which
sits within its components unit alongside robotics specialist
Comau and castings firm Teksid. The unit employs around 43,000
people and operates in 19 countries.
    Calsonic is paying around 17 times next year's estimated
earnings for Magneti Marelli, according to Galliers'
calculations. That's more than double what listed rivals such as
Valeo <VLOF.PA> or Continental <CONG.DE> are worth, according to
Refinitiv data.
    ""As this transaction highlights, there is still value in
parts of current supplier portfolios, if crystallised
appropriately,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said, adding
that the sale could lead to a special dividend of as much as 2
billion euros. 
    A takeover of Magneti Marelli had seemed elusive as
potential bidders were offering too little or were only
interested in some parts of the business. 
    FCA also preferred the Calsonic offer to a pure private
equity bidder because it limits the risk of the unit being
broken up, sources have said. 
    With the Magneti Marelli sale wrapped up, focus will likely
shift to Teksid and Comau, the remaining components businesses
within FCA's portfolio, which have attracted interest from
rivals and private equity firms in the past.
    JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were financial advisers to FCA
on the Magneti Marelli deal, which is expected to close in the
first half of next year and is subject to regulatory approvals.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Spain's Supreme Court sought on
Monday to clarify who was responsible for paying stamp duty on
mortgages, upholding a ruling last week that banks were
responsible while saying it would make a final decision on who
should pay it in future early next month.
    Spanish bank shares fell on Thursday after the Supreme Court
unexpectedly overturned an earlier ruling in a case which
analysts estimate could cost them between 1.7 billion and 10
billion euros ($2-$11.5 billion) in compensation.
    Although banking shares recovered some of their losses on
Friday after Spain's highest court said it would review the
criteria and the impact of the stamp duty, which applies to the
value of the mortgage taken out on a property, they fell again
on Monday as it said the ruling was final. [nL8N1WY30D]
    However, it did not state from when clients were entitled to
be compensated or who would foot the bill in the future, with
shares in Bankia <BKIA.MC> falling 4.5 percent and Banco
Sabadell <SABE.MC> dropping by 4.9 percent.
    The back and forth over the decision by the Supreme Court
could have an impact on banks' mortgage lending business and has
prompted the Spanish banking association AEB to demand greater
legal security and predictable rules.
    A source at a Spanish bank said that some clients were now
visiting branches asking for clauses to be added to their
mortgage contracts, while others were even considering delaying
their decisions over signing new home loans.
    Although last week's ruling does not state from when clients
are entitled to be compensated, the Spanish legal systems allows
customers to potentially claim compensation from tax authorities
for cases going back four years.
    Gestha, a union of tax inspectors, on Monday estimated that
around 1.5 million clients could be entitled to claim 3.6
billion euros for the last four years from Spain's tax agency or
regional authorities.
    The ruling comes at a sensitive moment for Spanish banks as
they struggle to glean earnings from loans with interest rates
at historic lows and as increasing competition erodes margins.  
    It is the latest legal setback for Spanish lenders after a
European Court of Justice ruling in December 2016 that banks had
to compensate customers who were sold mortgages with interest
rate floors that were not clearly explained.
    The Supreme Court said the final ruling would be made on
Nov. 30.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 22: Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'Strong' 
Investment Management Quality Rating to Sabadell Prudente. The Outlook is 
Stable.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The rating is driven by the fund's strong investment process, which is well 
structured, incorporating both the full investment expertise of Sabadell's most 
senior investment staff and a rigorous fund-selection process. The rating also 
reflects Sabadell's strong position in the Spanish market and the combination of 
deep human resources and technological and risk resources that are well suited 
to the fund's requirements. Lastly, the fund has performed well compared with 
peers, achieving top quintile three-year risk-adjusted returns to end-September 
2018.

The 'Strong' rating is based on the following category scores:

Investment Process: Strong

Investment Resources: Proficient

Risk Management: Strong

Investment Performance: Strong

Company and Client Servicing: Strong

Fund Presentation

The fund is a UCITS multi-strategy low volatility fund of fund with a maximum 
25% equity exposure. The fund's objective is to outperform and index of Spanish 
peer funds. It was launched in 2001, with substantial revisions to the strategy 
most recently in 2012 and 2015. It had approximately EUR4.7 billion in assets 
under management (AUM) as of end-September 2018, making it the third-largest 
fund in its peer group.

Strong Investment Process

Fitch considers the investment process strong, benefitting from the full 
strength of Sabadell's most senior investment personnel and a robust fund 
selection process incorporating both qualitative and quantitative factors. The 
strategy benefits from a conservative investment approach, which is consistent 
with its stated investment objectives.

Strong Human Resources, Adequate Technology

Fitch considers that the depth of investment staff is strong, given the size of 
the investible universe, number of funds managed and the model portfolio 
process. The involvement of Sabadell's most senior investment professionals in 
the management of this fund is a strongly positive factor. Roles and 
responsibilities are clearly defined and segregated. Technology resources 
provide an adequate fit to the fund's requirements.

Strong Risk Management

Fitch considers the risk management framework to be sound. Risk management is 
effected by an independent team based on a daily and monthly risk-limit 
monitoring accompanied by defined escalation processes. The risk management 
framework incorporates scenario analysis based on assumed equity volatility 
regimes and redemptions, value at risk (VaR) measurement, and stress testing.

Top Quintile Risk Adjusted Returns

The fund has generated strong performance compared with domestic Spanish peers. 
The fund generated nominal gross performance of 3.3% over the three years to 
end-September 2018, which ranks it fourth among its close peers. It achieved 
this performance with adequately managed volatility, resulting in a Sharpe ratio 
of 0.15 which ranks it fourth among close peers for risk adjusted returns.

Strong Company and Client Servicing

Fitch considers Sabadell Asset Management to be a strong company. Sabadell Asset 
Management is a 100% subsidiary of Banco Sabadell, the fourth-largest private 
bank in Spain. It had EUR37 billion in AUM at end-December 2017, and has been 
growing ahead of market. It provides asset management across all main asset 
classes, with the majority of its AUM in investment funds. Client servicing is 
of good quality, we believe.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The rating may be sensitive to material adverse changes to any of its rating 
drivers, notably through weakened financial conditions, weakening performance or 
deterioration of processes and policies. A material deviation from Fitch's 
guidelines for any key rating drivers could cause the rating to be downgraded.

1965,4715,94e5add55d00efc91ddbd1c830f7220b,INSIGHT-How the man behind Khashoggi murder ran the killing via Skype,2018-10-23 1:51:24,EUR,0.94771,2018-10-23 1:51:37,"{'USD': 'Positive', 'EUR': 'Positive'}","    Oct 22 (Reuters) - He ran social media for Saudi Arabia's
crown prince. He masterminded the arrest of hundreds of his
country's elite. He detained a Lebanese prime minister. And,
according to two intelligence sources, he ran journalist Jamal
Khashoggi's brutal killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by
giving orders over Skype.
    Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman, is one of the fall guys as Riyadh tries to stem
international outrage at Khashoggi’s death. On Saturday, Saudi
state media said King Salman had sacked Qahtani and four other
officials over the killing carried out by a 15-man hit team.
    But Qahtani's influence in the crown prince's entourage has
been so vast over the past three years - his own rise tracking
that of his boss - that it will be hard for Saudi officials to
paint Qahtani as the mastermind of the murder without also
raising questions about the involvement of Prince Mohammed,
according to several sources with links to the royal court.
    ""This episode won't topple MbS, but it has hit his image
which will take a long time to be repaired if it ever does. The
king is protecting him,"" one of the sources with ties to the
royal court said.
    Qahtani himself once said he would never do anything without
his boss' approval.
    ""Do you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an
employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the
king and my lord the faithful crown prince,"" Qahtani tweeted
last summer.
    Qahtani did not respond to questions from Reuters. His
biography on Twitter changed in recent days from royal adviser
to chairman of the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity,
Programming and Drones, a role he had held before.
    Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the operation that led
to Khashoggi's death and ""certainly did not order a kidnapping
or murder of anybody"", a Saudi official said on Saturday.
Officials in Riyadh could not be reached for further comment.
    As the crisis has grown over the past three weeks, Saudi
Arabia has changed its tune on Khashoggi's fate, first denying
his death, then saying he died during a brawl at the consulate,
and now attributing the death to a chokehold.
    A senior Saudi official told Reuters that the killers had
tried to cover up what happened, contending that the truth was
only now emerging. The Turks reject that version of the story,
saying they have audio recordings of what happened.
    The kingdom has survived other crises in the past year,
including the fallout of the crown prince's short-lived
kidnapping of Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri in 2017.
Hariri, too, was verbally humiliated and beaten, according to
eight Saudi, Arab and Western diplomatic sources. The man
leading that interrogation: Saud al-Qahtani.
    France intervened to free Hariri, but Western capitals did
not take Riyadh to task for detaining a head of government - and
Prince Mohammed emerged emboldened, according to these Saudi
sources.
    This time is different, with some Western capitals
increasingly critical of the murder and the Saudi explanation.
    Germany has announced it will stop arms sales, while
Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement asking for
an ""urgent … clarification of exactly what happened Oct 2.""
    President Donald Trump has swung between saying he is
unhappy with the Saudi investigation but also that he does not
want to jeopardise U.S. arms sales to the country.
    
    SKYPE CALL
    To stem the fallout of the Khashoggi killing, the crown
prince, commonly known by his initials MbS, allowed Qahtani to
take the fall, according to one source close to the Saudi royal
court. 
    A second senior Saudi official said Qahtani had been
detained following his sacking by royal decree, but he continued
to tweet afterwards. The sources with links to the royal court
said he was not believed to be under arrest.
    In the Khashoggi killing, Qahtani was present as he has been
in other key moments of MbS's administration. This time, though,
his presence was virtual.
    Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Saudi journalist often critical of
Saudi Arabia and its leadership, walked into the Istanbul
consulate at around 1 pm on Oct 2, to pick up some documents
that would allow him to marry. 
    Turkish security sources say he was immediately seized
inside the consulate by 15 Saudi intelligence operatives who had
flown in on two jets just hours before.
    According to one high-ranking Arab source with access to
intelligence and links to members of Saudi Arabia’s royal court,
Qahtani was beamed into a room of the Saudi consulate via Skype.
    He began to hurl insults at Khashoggi over the phone.
According to the Arab and Turkish sources, Khashoggi answered
Qahtani’s insults with his own. But he was no match for the
squad, which included top security and intelligence operatives,
some with direct links to the royal court.
    A Turkish intelligence source relayed that at one point
Qahtani told his men to dispose of Khashoggi. ""Bring me the head
of the dog"", the Turkish intelligence source says Qahtani
instructed.               
    It is not clear if Qahtani watched the entire proceedings,
which the high-ranking Arab source described as a ""bungled and
botched operation"".
    The Arab source and the Turkish intelligence source said the
audio of the Skype call is now in the possession of Turkish
President Tayyip Erdogan. The sources say he is refusing to
release it to the Americans.
    Erdogan said on Sunday he would release information about
the Turkish investigation during a weekly speech on Tuesday.
Three Turkish officials reached by Reuters declined to comment
ahead of that speech.
    The senior Saudi official who laid out the official version
of events – that Khashoggi had got into a fight – said he had
not heard about Qahtani appearing via Skype, but that the Saudi
investigation was ongoing.
    
    QAHTANI’S RISE
    Qahtani, 40, has earned a reputation at home as both a
violent enforcer of princely whims and as a strident
nationalist. In blogs and on social media, some liberal Saudi
journalists and activists dubbed him the Saudi Steve Bannon for
his aggressive manipulation of the news media and
behind-the-scenes strategizing.
    Qahtani wrote odes on Twitter to the royal family under the
pen name Dari, which means predator in Arabic. Some of his
opponents on social media call him Dalim, a figure in Arabic
folklore who rose from being a lowly servant to much greater
heights.
    According to his biography on his Twitter account, Qahtani
studied law and made the rank of captain in the Saudi air force.
After launching a blog, he caught the eye of Khaled al-Tuwaijri,
the former head of the royal court, who hired him in the early
2000s to run an electronic media army tasked with protecting
Saudi Arabia’s image , according to a source with ties to the
royal court.
    Tuwaijri is under house arrest and could not be reached for
comment.
    Qahtani rose to further prominence after latching onto
Prince Mohammed, who was part of his father Salman's court as
Riyadh governor, then crown prince and finally king in 2015
    Tasked with countering alleged Qatari influence on social
media, Qahtani used Twitter to attack criticism of the kingdom
in general and Prince Mohammed in particular. He also ran a
WhatsApp group with local newspaper editors and prominent
journalists, dictating the royal court’s line.
    When Riyadh led an economic boycott against Qatar in June
2017, Qahtani ramped up his attacks on the small Gulf state.
Online, he urged Saudis to tweet the names of anyone showing
sympathy with Qatar under the Arabic hashtag ""The Black List"".
    The high-ranking Arab official and Saudi sources with ties
to the royal court said Qahtani was MbS's ""bad cop"" late last
year when 200 people, including Saudi princes, ministers and
business tycoons, were detained and put under house arrest at
the Ritz Carlton in an anti-corruption sweep. Qahtani oversaw
some of the interrogations, the Arab official said.
    
    A KIDNAPPING
    The extent of Qahtani’s power is perhaps best illustrated by
the kidnapping of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri last
year, several of the Saudi and Arab diplomatic sources said.
    The Saudis were incensed at the inability of Hariri, a Sunni
Muslim and a Saudi client, to stand up to their regional rival
Iran and Hezbollah, the Shi'ite paramilitary movement that acts
as Tehran’s spearhead in the region. Hariri belonged to the same
multi-party coalition government as Hezbollah.
    The Saudis were particularly dismayed that Hariri had failed
to deliver a message to a top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to stop interfering in Lebanon and
Yemen. Hariri claimed he had delivered the Saudi message, but an
informer, planted by Qahtani in Hariri's circle, gave the Saudis
the minutes of the meeting which showed that he had not done so.
    The Saudis lured Hariri to Riyadh for a meeting with MbS.
Upon his arrival on Nov. 3, 2017, there was no line-up of Saudi
princes or officials, as would typically greet a prime minister
on an official visit. Hariri later received a call that the
meeting with the crown prince would take place the next day at a
royal compound.
    When Hariri arrived, he was ushered into a room where
Qahtani was waiting for him with a security team, according to
three Arab sources familiar with the incident. The security team
beat Hariri; Qahtani cursed at him and then forced him to resign
as prime minister in a statement that was broadcast by a
Saudi-owned TV channel.
    ""He (Qahtani) told him you have no choice but to resign and
read this statement,"" said one of the sources. ""Qahtani oversaw
the interrogation and ill-treatment of Hariri.""
    Another source said it was the intervention of French
President Emmanuel Macron that secured his release following an
international outcry.
    Macron claimed credit in May for ending the crisis, saying
an unscheduled stopover in Riyadh to convince MbS, followed by
an invitation to Hariri to come to France, had been the catalyst
to resolving it. Lebanese officials confirmed to Reuters that
Macron's quick intervention secured Hariri's return.
    Saudi officials could not be reached for comment about the
sequence of events or Qahtani's involvement. French officials
declined to comment when asked about Qahtani's role.
             
    AN OFFER TO RETURN HOME
    At least three friends of Khashoggi told Reuters that in the
months after the journalist moved to Washington a year ago he
received multiple phone calls from MbS’s right-hand man urging
him to return to Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi had balked, they said,
fearing reprisals for his Washington Post columns and outspoken
views.
    Qahtani had tried to reassure the former newspaper editor
that he was still well respected and had offered the journalist
a job as a consultant at the royal court, the friends said.
    Khashoggi said that while he found Qahtani gentle and polite
during those conversations, he did not trust him, one close
friend told Reuters. ""Jamal told me afterwards, 'he thinks that
I will go back so that he can throw me in jail?"" 
    The second senior Saudi official confirmed that Qahtani had
spoken to Khashoggi about returning home. The ambush in Istanbul
seems to have been another way to get him home.
    How much did the crown prince know about his trusted aide’s
plan to abduct Khashoggi? 
    Most of the 15 hit-man team identified by Turkish and Saudi
authorities worked for the kingdom's security and intelligence
services, military, government ministries, royal court security
and air force. One of them, General Maher Mutreb, a senior
intelligence officer, who is part of the security team of Prince
Mohammed, appeared in photographs with him on official visits
earlier this year to the United States and Europe.
    The high-ranking Arab official and the Turkish intelligence
source said it was Mutreb's phone that was used to dial in
Qahtani while Khashoggi was being interrogated. 
    Reuters tried to contact members of 15-man team but their
phones were either switched off, on voicemail or no longer in
service.
    The Saudi official said Deputy Intelligence Chief General
Ahmed al-Asiri put together the 15-man squad from the
intelligence and security forces. Asiri was one of the five
officials dismissed on Saturday.
    Another key figure was Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy, a forensic
expert specialised in autopsies attached to the Saudi Ministry
of Interior. His presence – equipped with a bone-saw Turkish
sources say was used to dismember the journalist – is hard to
explain in an operation Saudi officials now say was aimed at
persuading Khashoggi to return home.
    It is hard to imagine that the crown prince could have not
known about such a delicate operation, the Saudi sources with
ties to the royal court say.
    The Saudi official who spoke on Saturday said an existing
standing order provided authorisation to ""negotiate"" with
dissidents to return home without requiring approval, but that
the team involved with Khashoggi exceeded that authorisation.
    Another Saudi official close to the investigation said that
Qahtani decided on his own to organise Khashoggi’s kidnapping
and that he asked Asiri to get a team together, but that their
plans had gone wrong.
    Qahtani's final act may be to serve his boss by assuming the
responsibility for the crisis that has hit Saudi Arabia since
Khashoggi's murder. The Saudi king has sacked Qahtani and
ordered a restructuring of the general intelligence agency. 
    To head it, he named MbS.

control of the northern Italian province of Trento, ousting the
centre-left coalitions that have ruled for decades, in the
latest breakthrough by the anti-immigrant party.
    The League's junior health minister Maurizio Fugatti was
elected provincial governor on Monday with almost 47 percent of
the vote, backed by a coalition including Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and local civic lists. 
    The League, led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini,
garnered more than 27 percent, almost twice as much as the
centre-left Democratic Party and quadrupling its vote at the
previous regional election in 2013.
    The League, which won 17 percent of the vote at a national
election in March, has seen its popularity surge on the back of
a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration, and is now
Italy's leading party with more than 30 percent, according to
opinion polls.
    Trento is one of the two provinces in the region of Trentino
Alto Adige, which enjoys autonomous legislative and
administrative powers that give it a significant degree of
independence from the central government.
    In German-speaking Alto Adige, the region's other province,
the Südtiroler Volkspartei (SVP) - a local party which normally
governs with the centre left - led the way with almost 42
percent of the vote. The League got 11 percent.
    The SVP is now widely expected to govern Trentino Alto Adige
with the League.
    ""For the first time in the history of Trento and Alto Adige
the PD and the left will pack their bags and go home,"" Salvini
said on Twitter.

    ORTENBERG, Germany, Oct 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor
Angela Merkel on Monday called the killing of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a ""monstrosity"" and
vowed to halt all German arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the
case is cleared up.
    Merkel decried what she called ""the monstrosity there in the
Saudi consulate in Turkey"".
    ""It must be cleared up. As long as it's not cleared up,
there will be no arms exports to Saudi Arabia. I assure you of
that very decidedly,"" Merkel said at a campaign rally in the
town of Ortenberg ahead of elections in the state of Hesse.
    Riyadh has given multiple and conflicting accounts on what
led to Khashoggi's death. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Adel
al-Jubeir called the killing a ""huge and grave mistake"" but
sought to shield Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince.
[nL8N1X10M8]
    Merkel first called for a stop to arms exports on Sunday,
raising questions about whether that would also affect weapons
deliveries that had previously been approved. Her spokesman told
reporters earlier on Monday that was being reviewed.
    Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's conservatives and
head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said it was
clear that all deliveries of weapons to Saudi Arabia should be
halted.
    ""Even those deals that were already approved cannot happen
now, as long as the case has not been resolved, and as long as
there have been no substantial consequences in Riyadh,"" Roettgen
told broadcaster ZDF. ""We would completely lose our
credibility.""
    Economy Minister Peter Altmaier earlier had called on other
European Union member states to follow its example.
    ""The government is in agreement that we will not approve
further arms exports for the moment because we want to know what
happened,"" Atmaier told broadcaster ZDF.
    So far this year the German government approved weapons
exports worth more than 400 million euros ($462 million) to
Saudi Arabia, making it the second-biggest recipient of German
arms after Algeria.

    By George Hay
    ABU DHABI, Oct 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Epic
natural-resource wealth, a ruling family becoming more
progressive, and a pot of cash to invest in diversifying the
economy. Until recently, asset managers looking for all that,
plus Gulf exposure, would think first of Saudi Arabia. Ditto
start-ups and governments attracted by the $45 billion pumped
into SoftBank’s <9984.T> Vision Fund or $20 billion destined for
a Blackstone <BX.N> infrastructure fund from the kingdom. With
Riyadh’s reputation now crushed following the murder of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Qatar may be their best alternative.
    Pivoting to Doha is less weird than it sounds. True, in June
2017 the tiny desert peninsula was blockaded by Bahrain, Egypt,
the United Arab Emirates and Saudi for a litany of alleged sins,
precipitating a $30 billion non-resident funding exodus from its
banking system. But Qatar switched trading partners and plonked
$40 billion of reserves and overseas deposits from its central
bank and $300 billion sovereign wealth fund into its lenders.
Already $16 billion of that has been refinanced by Asian and
European banks and investors, Fitch reckons.
    Assuming Qatar can refinance the rest – which should be
easier given a potential 4.7 percent budget surplus in 2018 over
last year’s 2.9 percent deficit – it would have $40 billion of
spare cash. If it was feeling racy, it could leverage that and
turn it into a Vision Fund-scale investor. But it doesn’t matter
that the Qatar Investment Authority tends to be rather more
conservative. Doha’s hike of liquefied natural gas production
from 77 million tonnes to 110 million tonnes by 2024 could
create an extra $40 billion of revenue. With annual capital
investment due to halve from around $27 billion as the 2022
soccer World Cup nears, the QIA could be packing serious
firepower.
    Rather than splash out on Saudi-style adventures like
mega-city NEOM, Qatar could invest in steady infrastructure
assets – around Africa, for example, maybe partnering with
Chinese entities. Or it could look to turn itself into a hub for
gas and energy technology. But a Vision Fund-style tech investor
is at least feasible. And Qatar’s more enlightened social
policies and approach to press freedoms might endear it to more
discerning American and European startups or municipalities
seeking capital. Maybe next year investors will head to Doha
instead.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 23: Fitch Ratings says the Belgian government's 
move to encourage the entry of a fourth mobile operator at next year's planned 
spectrum auctions could be successful as a result of regulatory conditions that 
could help reduce peak funding requirements for a new venture. 

While a typical business case of the fourth operator is challenging, a more 
radical 'maverick' approach could improve the risk-return dynamics for 
investors. Such an entry would have a significant impact on the competitive 
dynamics of the telecoms market and the credit profile of the three main 
telecoms operators Proximus, Orange Belgium and Telenet (BB-/Stable). 

The Belgian government is set to auction mobile spectrum across a number of 
frequency bands including 700, 900, 1400, 1800, 2100, 3600 MHz bands in 2H19. 
The auction has been structured to encourage the entry of a fourth mobile 
operator by setting a number of favourable conditions. These include reserving 
70 MHz of spectrum across mid, low and high frequency bands, mandated national 
roaming for eight years after 20% coverage, the possibility of spectrum trading 
after six years and spectrum sharing after approval and staggered geographic 
coverage obligations.

The regulatory conditions that Belgium is providing for a new entrant are 
broadly similar to Poland, which saw the entry of fourth mobile operator P4 over 
a decade ago. Since its launch, P4 has grown from market challenger to market 
leader with around a 29% subscriber market share. Central to the company's 
success was strong implementation, the deployment of a low-cost business model 
and the ability to minimise the venture's peak funding requirement that helps to 
reduce risk and improve payback and investment returns.

Key to reducing P4's peak funding requirement were the availability of a long 
duration national roaming agreement, which would allow the use of existing 
mobile networks on a wholesale basis and sufficient frequencies that support the 
deployment of 2G, 3G and 4G technologies. These enabled P4 to lower the upfront 
cost of deploying a mobile telecom network and instead take a paced approach 
that could gradually be funded through cash flow generation. 

A new mobile entrant in Belgium would have similar scope to reduce its peak 
funding requirement for capex and operating cost. The new entrant would, 
however, need to match this with a commercial strategy to grow the customer base 
and build scale. This is a significant challenge for a mobile-centric new 
entrant and an area of highest investment risk, given the maturity of the 
Belgian mobile market and prevalence of fixed-mobile convergence in 
consumer-buying patterns.

Iliad, which launched as a fourth mobile operator in Italy in 2Q18 grew its 
customer base to over 1 million within a few months through significant pricing 
discounts. The discounts create a 'sales-pull', the economics of which are 
supported by cost savings in direct distribution and marketing. Like Italy, the 
Belgium telecoms market features low handset subsidies but similar or higher 
average revenue per user levels. Italy, however, has a pre-paid subscriber share 
of around 70% compared with Belgium's of less than 30%, which may have aided 
Iliad's rapid growth.

The deployment of 5G over the next two to three years may also be an area that 
could support the business case for a new entrant. The technology will improve 
capacity and speed of data services, which will for the first time enable 
mobile-centric operators to target data segments of the market that are 
currently addressed through fixed line services.  While we do not believe 5G 
will be a substitute for fixed line data service across most market segments, it 
will, however, enable mobile operators to grow the addressable market size of 
mobile services. 

The possible entry of a fourth mobile operator in Belgium will have a 
significant impact on the competitive dynamics of the market with both MVNOs and 
incumbent operators exposed. Orange Belgium is likely to be the most exposed due 
to its predominantly mobile revenue stream. Telenet and Proximus have 
significant revenue from the business segment, fixed line services and 
convergent-based products that would help weather the impact on group level 
finances. However, both organisations in our opinion would benefit from a more 
radical approach to their cost structure, particularly given the opportunity for 
fixed-mobile broadband substitution in certain segments of the market.

2017,4863,56c2ba4a54ae3b7de00d5ffd1b19d44e,France begins deliberations on new aircraft carrier,2018-10-23 18:00:18,EUR,0.11266,2018-10-23 18:04:00,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    PARIS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - France will make a decision on the
replacement of its flagship aircraft carrier the Charles de
Gaulle at the start of 2020, its armed forces minister said on
Tuesday.  
   The carrier has been in service since 2001 but Paris is
looking to build a vessel that would take into consideration
expected technological advances post-2030 and be capable of
carrying a planned new Franco-German fighter jet.
    ""The Charles de Gaulle will need a successor,"" Florence
Parly said in a speech at a defence exhibition in Paris.
    ""The first step, which starts today, is the study phase to
determine what and how we want our future aircraft carrier to
be. We have given ourselves 18 months,"" she said.
    Three other Western aircraft carriers have been built since
the Charles de Gaulle was first deployed. The U.S. Navy's Gerald
R. Ford and America, and the British Royal Navy's Queen
Elizabeth, which cost about 3.1 billion pounds ($4.03 billion). 
    
    Parly said the study will assess the size requirements, 
propulsion options - both conventional and nuclear - and
aircraft-launching capabilities.
    A number of French defence firms, ranging from Rafale
warplane maker Dassault <AVMD.PA> to systems' contractor Thales
<TCFP.PA>, are among companies involved in the study phase. 
    The French navy recently completed an 18-month mid-life
upgrade of the Charles de Gaulle. Its most recent activity was
as part of support operations against Islamic State militants in
the Levant region and its battle group is due to return to sea
in the first quarter of 2019.

rescue fund said on Tuesday Greece had no urgent need to issue
new debt for the coming two years but urged a gradual approach
with a possible new issuance when sovereign yields drop from
current levels.
    Greece exited its third bailout in a decade in August. As
part of the financial programme, euro zone lenders gave Greece a
last tranche of loans worth 15 billion euros ($17.19 billion) to
bolster a cash buffer against market pressure for a couple of
years.   
   As a consequence of that deal, ""now there is no urgent need 
for them to go to the markets,"" Klaus Regling, who chairs the
European Stability Mechanism rescue fund, told a news
conference. 
   He said the Greek cash buffer now stood at 22 billion euros,
which meant that ""they don't need to go to the markets for two
years.""
    However, he added that Greece's full return to market
financing should happen gradually with a possible new issuance
before 2020 following two ""quite successful"" auctions last year.
 
    ""The secondary market's yields are higher than they were six
months ago. I would expect when secondary market yields come
down again they (the Greek authorities) will do it,"" Regling
said.
     The head of the rescue fund underlined that it was a
decision that Greece would make on its own while taking into
account national and international developments.
    ""I am confident they will do the right thing,"" he told
reporters.

    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Sterling gained half a percent
versus the dollar and euro on Tuesday after a media report that
the European Union could offer British Prime Minister Theresa
May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal.
    The report by Ireland's RTE News followed a Reuters story on
Monday that EU negotiators were looking at ways to promise
Britain a customs deal. [nL8N1X250D]
    EU diplomats have told Reuters that the bloc is examining 
ways to solve the Irish border problem by keeping the whole of
the United Kingdom, and not just Northern Ireland, inside the
EU’s customs territory. 
    This would be fully settled only in post-Brexit negotiations
– and the EU would set stricter terms than May offered. The EU
also still wants some element of special protection for Northern
Ireland in the treaty, although it may be only hypothetical. 
    ""It’s more of the positive news that things are progressing
in terms of the Irish border issue,"" said ING analyst Viraj
Patel, adding that getting May's colleagues to buy into such an
agreement would prove very difficult. ""Until the market sees a
politically viable Brexit deal, sterling is not really going to
hold to short term spikes or gains.""
    The pound rose from below $1.30 <GBP=D3> to as high as
$1.3044 after the RTE report, up 0.6 percent on the day, before
giving up some of the gain. It also jumped versus the euro to as
much as 87.995 pence before easing back to 88.1 pence
<EURGBP=D3>. 
    May's spokesman said on Tuesday that the British leader was
confident she could get a Brexit deal that will win the support
of parliament. [nS8N1TG02E]
    The prime minister had told parliament on Monday that the
Brexit deal with Brussels was 95 percent complete, and she urged
restive lawmakers to back her in the final stages of Britain's
exit from the EU, saying talks were in their most difficult
phase. [nL8N1X21VU]
    But opponents within her own party and in the opposition
have stepped up criticism of the deal she is trying to get, even
if an imminent challenge to May's leadership appears less
likely.
    Analysts said it would remain difficult to find a compromise
between May, her allies and those in her party that wanted a
sharper break from the EU. 
    ""It will be really, really hard to work out a viable
compromise and until that happens, GBP has further to fall,""
said Marshall Glitter, chief strategist at ACLS Global.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 23: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Aeroporti di 
Roma S.p.A.'s (AdR) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' and 
Short-Term IDR at 'F2'. The Outlook for the Long-Term IDR is Stable. At the same 
time, the agency affirmed AdR's senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB+'.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

AdR is Italy's largest airport operator and its ratings reflect the strong 
origin and destination (O&D) traffic at Rome's airports, which provides 
resilience to traffic shocks, a robust tariff and concession framework expiring 
in 2044, and moderate current and projected leverage.

The 'BBB+' rating also reflects AdR's exposure to loss-making Alitalia (AZ) and 
the limited visibility around the role that Rome's airports will play following 
the airline's entry into insolvency procedures (""amministrazione 
straordinaria""). 

Compared to peers in its rating category, AdR has a below-average leverage 
level, offset by its uncovenanted corporate-like debt structure and exposure to 
AZ.

Resilient Traffic, AZ Exposure - Revenue Risk (Volume): Midrange

The Rome airport system - which processes 47 million passengers annually - has a 
strong O&D base (78%), and a predominantly international, inbound and 
leisure-related traffic structure, driven by Rome's status as an international 
tourist and religious destination. Its exposure to competition is limited, as 
there are no other large international airports in AdR's wealthy catchment area. 


AdR's traffic demonstrated resilience in the 2008-2010 global financial crisis, 
although the Italian recession had a negative impact on 2012 and 2013 traffic. 
Exposure to troubled AZ (around 35% of traffic, 30% of aero revenues) is a 
weakness, as we perceive low visibility on the short- and medium-term prospects 
of the airline's operating and financial performance and related impact on AdR's 
traffic volumes.

Price Cap, Dual Till - Revenue Risk (Price): Midrange

AdR's tariff framework provides revenue visibility and is better than other 
major European airports, as it offers higher protection against traffic 
shortfalls through possible partial tariff adjustments. Tariffs are set within a 
price cap dual till system tracking inflation and capex. The roll-out of the 
capex plan, if realised in full, would mechanically trigger significant tariff 
growth, which may entail some price elasticity in the medium term.

Ambitious Capex Plan - Infrastructure Development and Renewal: Midrange

The execution of AdR's EUR1.8 billion capex plan between 2017 and 2021, 
increasing to EUR10 billion by 2044, remains a big challenge and key driver for 
increasing tariffs and cash flow generation. The plan is significant in size, 
but has some flexibility in case of structural shocks on traffic volumes, like a 
material downsizing of AZ operations at Rome Fiumicino airport. Execution risk 
is substantially mitigated by the company's integration with experienced 
infrastructure operator Atlantia (BBB+/RWN).

Unsecured Bullet Debt - Debt Structure: Midrange

AdR's debt is typical of a corporate, with senior unsecured, fixed-rate debt, 
predominantly non-amortising and lacking material structural protections. Debt 
structure is mainly made up of bonds (83%), but AdR has also established 
relationships with banks, as well as the European Investment Bank and Cassa 
Depositi e Prestiti, to provide alternative funding at attractive terms. There 
are no debt maturities until late 2020. 

Debt is non-recourse to AdR's parent Atlantia, but we consider the presence of 
such a well reputed sponsor and its well established relationships with bank and 
capital markets a supporting factor in AdR's refinancing process. 

Financial Profile

AdR's strong and stable cash flow generation should fund growing, albeit 
flexible dividend distribution and a share of the large capex plan. Additional 
debt should make up the difference. Under the updated Fitch Rating Case (FRC), 
we expect Fitch-adjusted net leverage to increase from 2.2x in 2017 to 3.6x in 
2022, slightly below last year's FRC of 3.9x in 2021.

PEER GROUP 

AdR's closest peers are London Gatwick (BBB+/Stable), Brussels (BBB+/Stable) and 
Copenhagen (BBB/Stable for consolidated entity) airports. Compared to Gatwick, 
AdR's better traffic resilience and lower leverage (five-year average: 2.9x vs 
6.9x for Gatwick) is offset by a relatively weaker catchment area, 
covenant-light debt structure and exposure to loss making AZ. Compared to 
Brussels airport, AdR's exposure to AZ and higher capex requirements offset its 
lower leverage (five-year average: 2.9x vs 4.2x for Brussels). Copenhagen 
airport has a similar role to AdR, with some hub functions operated by 
financially troubled airline, but its rating is one notch lower as it is more 
highly leveraged and has a less straightforward capital structure.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

AdR is rated on a standalone basis, but we may reassess the links between AdR 
and Atlantia if we change the rating approach for the Atlantia group following 
Atlantia's co-acquisition of Abertis Infraestructuras S.A. (BBB+/RWN).

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative 
Rating Action:

- projected Fitch-adjusted net leverage sustainably above 5x under FRC

Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive 
Rating Action:

- no material loss of traffic and revenues as a result of AZ restructuring 
process, leading to projected Fitch-adjusted net leverage sustainably below 4x 
under FRC

CREDIT UPDATE

Performance Update

Following robust cumulative double-digit growth since 2014, 2017 traffic was 
almost flat (-0.6%); growth in extra-EU passengers (+6.4%) offset a shrinking 
domestic traffic (-8.1%) where domestic carrier AZ lowered its capacity. The 
traffic mix proved positive to both aero and commercial revenues thanks to 
materially different tariffs for international versus domestic pax and higher 
willingness to pay for long-haul passengers. The same trend was evident in 
August 2018 YTD traffic (+3.6%), where extra-EU passengers (+15.1%) more than 
offset a still stagnant domestic market (-1.0%). 

Tariffs for 2018 are little changed versus 2017 (-1%), amid delays in the 
roll-out of the capex plan and a mild inflation environment. FY17 EBITDA stood 
at EUR519 million, above our expectation of EUR480 million in last year's Fitch 
base-case scenario.

Performance Update: Alitalia

Due to a high cost base and the growing penetration of low-cost carriers in the 
short- and medium-haul European market, in May 2017 loss-making AZ entered into 
""extraordinary administration"".

In 2017, AZ's extraordinary administrators started a sale process that has since 
stalled due to the political uncertainties in Italy and the change in government 
in March 2018. We now understand that a deal, in which a state-owned entity 
would buy a majority stake, could be finalised by the end of the year. There is 
currently no visibility on the final outcome of the negotiations and the 
strategic plan of the new AZ, but our downside sensitivity shows AdR's 
resilience to an AZ liquidation scenario. Exposure to connecting revenues is 
limited and O&D traffic should remain generally steady, if briefly diminished, 
as other airlines take up more capacity.

Fitch Cases

The Fitch base case assumes 3% traffic growth in 2018, scaled down to average 
1.9% in 2019-2022, aligned with our assumptions on world and Italy GDP growth. 
Amid delays in the rollout of the capex plan observed in the current regulatory 
period, we reduced the 2018-2022 capex plan by EUR0.5 billion to EUR1.5 billion 
- to be spent in the following regulatory period - and a flat tariff until 2021. 
Projected Fitch-adjusted net leverage should reach 2.8x in 2020, increasing to 
3.5x in 2022.

The FRC takes a more prudent stance, as it assumes 2.5% traffic growth in 2018, 
reduced to 1.6% average yoy until 2022, and the cost of debt at 4.5% for new 
lines. Fitch-adjusted net leverage should climb to 2.9x in 2020 and 3.6x in 
2022.

An AZ liquidation is not our base-case scenario. However, we have run a scenario 
assuming a liquidation of AZ and where AdR's leverage should remain below the 5x 
negative trigger until 2022 assuming (i) AdR loses all of AZ's 9 million pax 
connecting traffic and associated revenues, (ii) AdR does not materially catch 
up traffic following the shock, (iii) there is no recovery of this traffic 
shortfall through the tariff, and (iv) the dividend payout ratio remains 
unchanged at 100%, but (v) the capex plan is reduced to 50%.

Asset Description 

AdR is a 99% owned subsidiary of Atlantia. It is Italy's largest airport 
operator serving 46.9 million pax in 2017 by running Rome's two airports, 
Fiumicino (87.4% of total pax) and Ciampino (used by low-cost carriers) under a 
long-term concession contract expiring in 2044. It has a strong origin and 
destination base, with volumes underpinned by Rome's status as the national 
capital and an international tourist and religious destination.

    ROME, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission has
rejected Italy's 2019 budget and will ask Rome to present a new
document within three weeks, Italian news agency AGI reported on
Tuesday, citing EU sources.
    The Commission will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m.
(13:30 GMT) to formally announce the decision, AGI said.
    Italy's government of the right-wing League and
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has been locked in a dispute
with Brussels over fiscal issues and presented a budget plan
this month that hikes the deficit to 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product.
    That was sharply up from a targeted 1.8 percent this year,
flouting EU requirements that the deficit should fall steadily
towards a balanced budget.
    Since receiving beefed-up powers in 2013 over member states'
budgetary plans, the Commission has never asked a country to
submit a revised budget.
    The AGI report sent Italian bond yields higher across the
board. (nL8N1X35B6)
    The EU executive warned last week in a letter to Rome that
the budget represented an ""unprecedented"" deviation from Italy's
previous fiscal commitments, while Italian ministers have traded
insults with commissioners.
    In recent days Italy has adopted more moderate tones but 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said there is no reason to
change the deficit target.

    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa
May will face her Conservative Party lawmakers in a private
meeting in parliament on Wednesday, her spokesman said, as she
seeks to calm growing tensions over her Brexit strategy.
    May will make a rare appearance at a meeting of the party's

    May again failed to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week

post-Brexit transition period, keeping Britain under EU
governance with no say in it, to help end the deadlock has
angered both hardline supporters of Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt/Paris/London-October 23: Fitch Ratings has affirmed 
Deutsche Bahn AG's (DB) Long-Term Foreign Currency and Local-Currency Issuer 
Default Ratings (IDR) at 'AA' and affirmed its Short-Term Foreign Currency and 
Local-Currency IDR at 'F1+'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. 
Fitch has also affirmed Deutsche Bahn Finance GmbH's senior unsecured rating at 
'AA' and assigned ratings of 'AA' to the EUR25 billion debt issuance programme 
and the AUD5 billion Kangaroo programme as well as 'F1+' rating to the EUR2 
billion Commercial Paper programme. The notes issued by Deutsche Bahn Finance 
GmbH are fully guaranteed by DB.

Fitch reviewed DB under the Government Related Entities Criteria applying the 
top-down approach. DB is viewed as a credit-linked entity to its sole owner, the 
Federal Republic of Germany (Germany; AAA/Stable). The affirmation considers our 
assessment of the 'strength of linkage' and 'incentive to support' factors as 
stated below and, notably, for Status, Ownership & Control our 'Strong' 
assessment based on the current federal government's commitment not to dilute 
its share in DB and force the privatisation of its shareholding. 

DB is an international servicer of mobility and logistics and acts in more than 
130 countries, employing more than 310,000 people (1H18: 316,919). DB is 
operating in a quasi-monopoly in its core business DB Long-Distance and is 
market leader in regional transport, having a market share above 65%. DB owns 
and services the largest railway infrastructure networks in Europe. It has about 
33,000 kilometres of tracks in Germany and is mainly responsible for the 
maintenance and development of the German rail-network infrastructure. In 1H18, 
DB generated a turnover of EUR24.2 billion and reported EBITDA of EUR2.2 billion 
(company figures).

KEY RATING DRIVERS

Status, Ownership and Control (Strong)

DB is established as a stock-holding company and is subject to bankruptcy 
proceedings. However, given DB's 100% ownership by the German state and its 
importance as manager of the German network railway infrastructure, it plays a 
strategic role in the transportation planning policies of the central and 
regional governments. The stakeholder does not have direct control of its 
operational business, but DB is decisive for the implementation of the 
government's long-term railway infrastructure development plan and is in a 
frequent exchange with government representatives. As sole shareholder, the 
state can appoint 50% (equalling the maximum for a stock-holding company 
according to German law) of the members of the supervisory board, ensuring 
direct control of the company's management board.

We view DB's company profile as credit-positive. DB group combines the 
railway-operating business with the management of the track infrastructure. This 
is the driver for DB's high leverage but the set-up is different from other 
European railway operators, such as SNCF Mobilites (A+/Stable/F1), which have 
separate business arms, but makes DB less exposed to the economic cycle.

Following DB's establishment as a stock-holding company, there has been 
discussion of a partial privatisation excluding the infrastructure units. The 
government has said it intends to keep its 100% stake, at least for the current 
coalition, with next elections taking place 2021.

Support Track Record & Expectations (Very Strong)

Due to DB's core mission, the state supports 2017-2021 scheduled capex of about 
EUR58 billion, of which approximately 60% is covered by investment grants, in 
line with previous provision of subsidies. The federal government also provided 
a EUR2.7 billion support package for 2017-2021 to strengthen DB's financial 
profile. Due to this, the federal government increased DB's equity by EUR1 
billion (2017: EUR14.2 billion) and agreed to receive EUR350million a year less 
in reduced dividend payments (2017: EUR600 million instead of EUR950 million). 
Also, DB contractually receives grants as a provider of regional transport. The 
German States support regional transport and the rail concession fees accounted 
for EUR3.9 billion, about 45% of DB Regio's total revenues in 2017.

DB would likely receive timely liquidity support from the government, in case of 
need, even if this would be above the government's statutory duties, to prevent 
the bankruptcy or default of DB.

The government is required under the constitution to retain majority ownership 
of the country's rail infrastructure and is obliged to ensure that it remains 
functional to support the German economy, supporting the assessment of the two 
factors above. 

Socio-Political Implications of a Default (Moderate)

Considering DB Group and its diversified business profile, we believe it would 
be very difficult to substitute DB in the short to medium term in its core 
long-distance, regional, and freight-transport businesses and as servicer of the 
country's rail network. Such a transition process could lead to service 
disruptions and these would likely have significant political or economic 
repercussions in central government. However, we believe that DB would be able 
to maintain its services were such a situation to arise, and this drives our 
moderate assessment, and we assume the state would provide support to avoid the 
risk to default.

Financial Implications of a Default (Strong)

A default of DB could lead to a reputational risk for Germany, which is Europe's 
largest bond issuer, issuing benchmark bonds. DB is a frequent issuer in the 
domestic and international capital markets for debt funding, and Germany 
supports DB's standalone funding strategy. DB has several debt-issuance 
programmes in place, ensuring its short-term and medium- to long-term 
refinancing and funding needs. DB further receives non-repayable investment 
grants from the state.

We consider DB to be a proxy-funding government vehicle for the maintenance and 
development of Germany's railway infrastructure. The government is 
constitutionally obliged to finance the railway infrastructure investments and 
DB has to comply with this duty, largely supported by government grants.

A default of DB could change investors' view of the credibility of Germany, 
hiking yields of future bonds issued or increasing the margins on new loans. In 
light of the reputational risk that Germany's treasury may face, and taking into 
account the German Laender as the largest subnational issuer group to face 
negative repercussions, we view the financial implications of DB's default as 
strong.

Standalone Credit Profile assessed at 'a-': DB has high capex needs, and 
corresponding debt financing has increased the company's indebtedness in recent 
years. In 1H18, DB reported short- and long-term financial debt of EUR23.5 
billion (2017: EUR22.1 billion). According to Fitch calculations, net debt to 
EBITDA was 4.0x in 2017 and our Rating Case expects Fitch-calculated net debt to 
EBITDA to peak at 6.6x in 2018 and to improve consistently to 5.0x by 2021. DB's 
debt servicing (debt repayment and interest expenditure of EUR3,044 million in 
2017) was comfortably covered by its available cash of EUR3,397 million at 
end-2017, while cash in 1H18 (EUR3,673 million) is sufficient to cover DB's 2018 
expected debt servicing of EUR2,864 million (Fitch estimates). Committed bank 
lines of EUR2 billion further support short-term liquidity needs.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Loosening links between DB and the sovereign or a dilution of support could lead 
to a widening of the notching. A change of our assumptions towards stronger 
socio-political and/or financial implications of a default could lead to a 
narrowing of the notching.

Any negative rating action on Germany will be reflected in DB's ratings, 
assuming that the links between the sovereign and DB remain unchanged.

Deutsche Bahn Finance GmbH's senior unsecured rating is equalised with DB's IDRs 
based on DB's guarantee provided and therefore will move in tandem with DB's 
ratings.

maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast

conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it 
in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification 
of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are 
available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's 
factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of 
relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its 
advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as

in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the 
report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. 
This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or 
sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals 
identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible

changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the

any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000

    Oct 24 (Reuters) - UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit
plan could leave Britain in a ""long running"" multiyear
transition period, the London Times reported on Wednesday citing
leaked documents seen by the newspaper.
    According to the leaked documents, the plan ""could in
theory, lead to a long running IP (implementation period)"" and
the arrangement could last for many years on a ""rolling"" basis
with an ""annual decision point"" where any transition extension
is reviewed, the Times reported http://bit.ly/2EJ625L.    
    The documents were drawn up by May's principal Europe
adviser, Oliver Robbins, on instructions from May's office,
according to the report.
    The documents reveal that cabinet ministers have been
presented with different models to work out what would happen if
a trade deal to govern UK's future relationship with the EU was
not reached by the end of the transition period, the Times said.

    By Simon Jessop
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world's largest
asset manager, will keep its biggest European operation and
regional headquarters in Britain after Brexit, moving ""only very
few"" roles to expanded offices in the Netherlands and France, a
memo to staff seen by Reuters showed.
    The commitment by the U.S. firm, which employs around 3,000
staff in Britain and manages around $6.3 trillion worldwide,
means it will still have three times as many staff in Britain as
in all of the remaining 27 European Union countries combined.
    After Brexit, Budapest will become the company's biggest
European Union office, with around 450 staff mainly focusing on
technology and back-office functions.
    The news will be a welcome boost for the City of London and
Prime Minister Theresa May's government as the clock counts down
to the country's March 2019 departure from the EU and talks over
an exit deal between London and Brussels near a conclusion.
    BlackRock had been among the most high-profile financial
services firms yet to confirm its Brexit plans, although more
are expected to announce them in the coming weeks as most
prepare for the worst-case scenario of a breakdown in talks.
    BlackRock said it was making two key changes to the way it
is structured. The first will see its Netherlands office take on
an expanded role to become the main legal entity for much of the
business carried out for EU clients. 
    The second, confirmed in September, will see its Paris
office expand to become a hub for so-called 'alternative'
investments such as real estate and infrastructure. [nFWN1VZ0EW]
    ""We have been preparing for the operational, legal and
strategic impacts of Brexit for several years, and at this
stage, we can tell you that only very few roles will be affected
by our decision to extend the regulatory permissions for
existing entities in Continental Europe,"" the memo said.
    BlackRock confirmed the contents of the memo.
    Total moves out of Britain over the next couple of years
would be minimal, a source familiar with the matter said, with
the Netherlands office adding 10 to 20 people through moves and
local hires, mostly in risk and legal.
    The Paris office, which currently houses 40 staff, mostly in
sales, would double to around 80 people over that time, but most
of those staff would be hired locally, he added.
    However, BlackRock appeared to leave the door open to
further staff moves depending on how the talks and post-Brexit
regulatory regimes change.
    ""As there is still much political and regulatory uncertainty
on the horizon, we remain flexible and continue to monitor all
developments very closely. We will keep you posted of further
developments,"" the memo said.

    By Lawrence White and Emma Rumney
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Barclays <BARC.L> reported a
profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.08 billion) for the
third quarter, as its under-pressure investment banking division
booked increased trading revenues despite difficult market
conditions.
    The bank also said it will redeem $2.65 bln worth of
preference shares, in a move it said would reduce its annual
funding costs by 165 million pounds a year.
    The transatlantic consumer and wholesale lender fashioned by
Chief Executive Jes Staley said income from its markets trading
business rose 19 percent in the third quarter, in a positive
sign for an investment banking-led strategy that has drawn
criticism from some cost-conscious investors, including activist
Edward Bramson. 
    Barclays reported a better than expected core capital ratio
of 13.2 percent at the end of the third quarter.
    That number had been depleted by fines and misconduct costs
in recent years and was a further source of concern for
investors, but Barclays in August signalled confidence in
capital levels by announcing a better than expected interim
dividend. [nL5N1UT1GM]
    The bank reiterated it was on track to pay a dividend of 6.5
pence per share for 2018.
    Barclays also said the Irish central bank had given
permission to expand its Irish operations, as it transfers the
ownership of all of its European branches to the entity, ahead
of Brexit on March 29.
    The bank's profit figures exclude costs from litigation and
fines for misconduct, which have blighted Barclays in recent
years as it paid out for a host of misdeeds during and after the
2008 financial crisis.
    Barclays group profits for the first nine months of the year
fell in comparison with the same period last year, as it booked
a 1.4 billion pound settlement with the U.S. Department of
Justice over mis-selling mortgage backed securities.

Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - In the end it was Theresa May who
asked to address her restive Conservative Party lawmakers at a
private meeting today rather than being ""summoned"" to hear their
complaints about her Brexit handling. That would suggest the
meeting is likely to be less awkward for her than first imagined
- even possibly allowing her to argue afterwards there was an
expression of loyalty towards her. The encounter comes amid
local media leaks of government planning for some of the most
extreme Brexit outcomes. On the one hand, The Times cites
documents drawn up by her chief Europe adviser which speak of a
""long-running implementation period"" (i.e transition phase) that
could be rolled over on an annual basis if needed - effectively
leaving the UK in an open-ended Norway-style relationship with
the EU. At the other extreme, the FT reports that plans were
discussed at a stormy cabinet meeting for Britain to charter
ships to ferry in critical food and medicines in the event of a
""no-deal"" Brexit.
    NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will be pushed at a
briefing this morning to respond to Donald Trump's plans to
withdraw from a 1987 treaty limiting arms in Europe. The move,
which came largely out of the blue but was confirmed by his
adviser John Bolton in Moscow last night, has created much
anxiety within NATO. Some in the alliance see it as the latest
example of the split between the Trump White House and the rest
of the US administration. More widely it is evidence of Trump
abandoning a core piece of NATO policy in a unilateral fashion.
Germany has said it will fight the proposal using all diplomatic
channels possible: the battle starts when Washington's NATO
ambassador presents the plan to fellow alliance envoys in
Brussels on Thursday.
    European capitals will be closely watching Italian PM
Giuseppe Conte's talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. Rome
is a firm critic of existing EU sanctions on Russia put in place
after its Crimea annexation but has not yet stated whether it
would veto fresh ones over, for example, the Skripal poisoning.
How or whether Rome uses that issue in leverage over its budget
stand-off with Brussels remains to be seen.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    A late rally for Wall St stock indices on Tuesday has helped
take the edge off an increasingly anxious mood on world markets
but the S&P still ended down for the 5th straight day, losing
more than half a percent. Although the rally from five-month
lows eased some nerves, the index failed to recapture its
200-day moving average and remains on course for its worst month
since at least August 2015. Peak-to-trough losses in October
were as much as 8.5 percent at one point yesterday. Earnings
season angst and worries about deteriorating corporate guidance
despite decent third quarter bottom lines has been one of main
drivers of the selloff this week, with markets wary of outlooks
from big industrial stocks such as Halliburton and Caterpillar
and fearful that rising trade tensions between the United States
and China will start to hit the big tech firms too. Caterpillar
stock dropped almost 8 percent on Tuesday after just failing to
lift its full-year 2018 steer for the first time in three
quarters. Microsoft will be the mostly closely watched update
later on Wednesday after the market closes. Global markets were
steadier overnight, with Chinese and Japanese equity benchmarks
eking out small gains and the MSCI all-country index flat for
the day so far, but at risk of recording its 6th straight daily
loss after hitting its lowest in more than year on Tuesday.
    European stocks futures opened up about half a percent amid
a deluge of earnings on this side of the pond and with the banks
in focus. But S&P futures were still in the red overnight and
10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped to 3.14 percent, with the
2-10-year yield curve flattening to its lowest in about three
weeks. Apart from earnings jitters, more general fears of ebbing
world growth amid escalating trade wars and
economically-sensitive political tensions from Saudi Arabia to
Italy and Brexit are enough to keep investors worried. Global
flash manufacturing business surveys for October out through the
day will be another key sounding on confidence. French
industrial confidence fell to its lowest reading in almost two
years this month, early PMI readings showed. A combination of
global demand concerns and Saudi commitments to keep supplies
buoyed enough to offset the loss of embargoed Iranian crude has
dragged Brent crude oil prices to its lowest in a month this
week but it hovered just above $76 per barrel first thing. 
    In currency markets, the safe-haven yen gave up much of
Tuesday’s gains against the dollar and the greenback was a touch
firmer more broadly. Sterling was off a fraction as markets eye
UK PM May’s meeting with backbenchers from her own ruling
Conservative party later today amid concerns about a leadership
challenge. Italian 10-year government bond yields were steady
below the week’s highs, with markets eyeing the next steps after
the European Commission on Tuesday asked Italy to resubmit its
draft budget with lower deficit targets.  Deputy PM Salvini
insisted again early on Wednesday that there would be no
changes, but also stressed Italy did not want to leave the euro
or European Union.
    In European corporate news, it’s a big days for banking
shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe.
Deutsche Bank stock lost almost 3 percent after announced a
steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track
to swing to a profit this year. Nordea also had a weak quarter
and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity.
Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned to cut at least 1,600
jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter
operating profit slightly above market expectations. In the UK,
Barclays  reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as
its under-pressure investment banking division booked increased
trading revenues despite difficult market conditions. Still in
financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose.

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SNAPS LOSING STREAK AS LUXURY SHINES (0725 GMT)    
    European shares are finally bouncing back after suffering five straight days of losses,
their longest losing streak since January's sell-off, as corporate updates take centre stage.
    Luxury, recently hit by worries over a slowdown in China and rich valuations, is clearly in
the spotlight after strong sales figures from Kering <PRTP.PA> that showed demand for Gucci
handbags proved more resilient than expected in the third quarter, even though it fell from
recent highs. [nL8N1X36I1]
    Shares in Kering are shooting up 10 percent, on track for its best day since early 2009 and
one of the top gainers in Europe, while rivals too are enjoying a nice bounce: LVMH <LVMH.PA> is
up more than 2 percent. Other top gainers in Europe such as razor and pen maker BIC <BICP.PA>,
oilfield services firm Saipem <SPMI.MI> and aerodefence group Safran <SAF.PA> are rising
following their earnings update. 
    Not all earning updates were well received: Boliden <BOL.ST> is tumbling 9 percent after
lower metal prices dented profits.  [nASP0001MY]

    WILL EARNINGS HELP LIFT MORALE? (0655 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to rise at the open although it is not clear at this stage
whether it will only be a limited and technical rebound. That will depend pretty much how
today’s new batch of corporate results are digested by the market. 
    One probable piece of good news is Kering, which is set for big gains at the open after its
results. 
    It’s also a big day for banking shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe. 
    Deutsche Bank announced a steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track to
swing to a profit this year. 
    Nordea also had a weak quarter and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity. Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned

    In the UK, Barclays reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as its under-pressure
investment banking division booked increased trading revenues despite difficult market
conditions.
    Still in financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose. 
    Heineken is also a big one with sales at the world’s second largest brewer rising in Q3. 
    In the tech sector, which got a beating yesterday and is also close to bear market
territory, STMicro Q3 profits rose on strong automotive, imaging sales. Other blue chips
reporting include France’s Safran and Edenred, Spain’s Iberdrola as well as Norway's Telenor and
Norsk Hydro. 
    Also, in what could be a blow to one of the most high-profile Franco-German tie-up, sources
told Reuters that Siemens and Alstom will receive a warning this week from European Union
antitrust regulators that their plan to create a rail champion will hurt competition.

    NO REBOUND IN SIGHT (0540 GMT)
    After five sessions in the red in a row and hitting two years low, there is still no rebound
in sight for European shares. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 147 points lower and Paris' CAC to
lose 74 points. An expection perhaps for London with the FTSE expected to open 69 points higher.

    STRASBOURG, Oct 24 (Reuters) - European Council President
Donald Tusk told the European Parliament on Wednesday that he
would be ready to call a special summit on Brexit whenever
negotiators said ""decisive progress"" had been made toward a
deal.
    Briefing lawmakers on last week's regular summit, Tusk
recalled that EU leaders had agreed that they would meet again
to endorse a deal if their negotiator Michel Barnier judged that
enough progress toward a deal had been made. A meeting pencilled
in for Nov. 17-18 is still on hold.
    ""I stand ready to convene a European Council, if and when
the Union negotiator reports that decisive progress has been
made,"" Tusk said. ""The Brexit talks continue with the aim of
reaching a deal,"" he added, saying no one wanted talks to fail.
    He repeated that he believed leaders would extend Britain's
status-quo transition period after Brexit in March if London
asked for that -- an issue May raised at the summit.
    ""It was made clear by the UK that more time is needed to
find a precise solution,"" Tusk said. ""Therefore, there is no
other way but to continue the talks. Leaders expressed their
full trust and support for Michel Barnier.""

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 24: Recent improvements in the supply of labour and 
the share of adults in employment have helped to mitigate the slowdown in 
supply-side growth potential in developed markets (DMs) says Fitch Ratings in a 
new report. 

The last five years have seen steep increases in the share of the working age 
population in employment (the employment rate) across most advanced economies. 
This has gone a long way in offsetting the impact of weaker demographics and 
labour productivity. By means of illustration, the unweighted 10 DMs covered by 
Fitch in its Global Economic Outlook (Fitch 10) average GDP growth has fallen to 
1.7% p.a. over the last five years compared with 1.9% p.a over the last 20 years 
as a whole, but the contribution from labour productivity and demographics fell 
by 0.8pp over that period. This highlights the benefits of improved labour 
market inclusion on GDP. Rising female (and elderly) labour force participation 
and falling unemployment rates look like structural trends in a number of DMs.  

Japan, the UK and Spain have witnessed the sharpest increase in the employment 
rate over the past five years. This represents a marked acceleration from the 
longer-term trend. ""The pickup is all of the more striking in Japan and the UK 
as these two countries already had a high employment rate in 2012-13 relative to 
peers. The bulk of the pick-up in job creation in developed markets has stemmed 
from a sharp drop in the unemployment rate in Spain, while in Japan the steep 
rise in the participation rate has played a much larger role,"" says Maxime 
Darmet, Associate Director in Fitch's Economics team.  

Today's  report provides updated projections for potential GDP for the Fitch 10 
DMs. Potential GDP growth was revised upwards modestly for seven countries, with 
only one downward revision. Canada and Spain have seen upward revisions of 
0.2pp, and the US, Japan, Germany, Italy and Switzerland positive revisions of 
0.1pp. The UK sees the only downward revision at 0.1pp. ""We have a slightly 
brighter outlook for trend employment rates and trend labour productivity in 
most countries, which underpin our projections of moderately higher potential 
growth for the next five years,"" said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch 
Ratings. 

Potential growth is still expected to be subdued over the next few years at less 
than 2% p.a on average for most advanced countries - well below longer-term 
historical post-war averages. This reflects deteriorating demographics and a 
long-term slowdown in labour productivity that is not expected to be reversed in 
any meaningful way in the next five years. Nevertheless the last five years have 
seen some marginal improvements in labour productivity performance and we expect 
a pick-up in the contribution of capital deepening to labour productivity over 
the next five years, partly reflecting stronger investment.   

Australia is still estimated to have the highest potential GDP growth, at 2.4% 
p.a. on average, supported by continued robust expansion in the population. US 
potential GDP growth is projected at 1.9% p.a., revised up in response to recent 
corporate tax reform, which should strengthen labour productivity by encouraging 
capital deepening. At the other end of the scale, potential growth in Italy is 
projected at just 0.5% p.a., weighed down by very weak productivity. Potential 
growth in Japan is also projected to be low at 0.8% but this masks very poor 
demographics offset by a strong productivity and employment outlook. UK 
potential growth is now projected at 1.6% p.a., revised down on the back of 
weaker prospects for net immigration flows and growth in the working-age 
population.

Potential growth in Germany has been upgraded to 1.4% p.a. on the back of 
improved forecasts for capital deepening. Potential growth in Spain is now 
estimated at 1.5% p.a., following several years of strong growth performance and 
clearer evidence of declining structural unemployment. Growth potential in 
France is unchanged at 1.2% p.a. but this masks improvements in the outlook for 
structural unemployment and productivity growth, offset by a weaker demographic 
outlook. Canada's growth potential is now estimated at 1.7% p.a., supported by 
strong labour productivity and improved outlook for labour force participation 
growth. Switzerland's growth potential is estimated at 1.5%, supported by a much 
stronger outlook for growth in the working-age population growth than elsewhere 
in Europe due to net-immigration flows.       

The report also includes stylised projections of actual growth over the next 
five years, which take into account the scope for growth to exceed estimated 
supply-side potential as spare capacity in the economy is absorbed (or negative 
'output gaps' are closed). However, the 10 DMs in the report are estimated, on 
average, to have a zero output gap in 2018. This implies limited scope for DM 
economies to grow faster than estimated supply-side potential over the 
medium-term without rising inflation or deteriorating external imbalances.     

Today's report, ""Modest Improvements in Potential Growth"", covers the following 
countries: United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, 
Australia, Canada and Switzerland. It is available by clicking the above link,

    By Stefano Bernabei
    ROME, Oct 24 (Reuters) - European lawmakers have
short-listed Italy's Andrea Enria and Ireland's Sharon Donnery
to be the next head of the EU's banking supervisory body, two
sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.
    Enria is chairman of the European Banking Authority while
Donnery is the Irish deputy central bank chief.
    The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs
Committee held a closed-door hearing in Strasbourg on Tuesday to
assess three candidates who had put themselves forward to take
charge of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). 
    They subsequently passed on the names of Enria and Donnery
to the European Central Bank, which takes the decision, the
sources said. French financial markets regulator Robert Ophele
was the third candidate, sources told Reuters last month.
    The 25-member governing council of the ECB is expected to
hold a secret ballot on the nomination at a Nov. 7 meeting.
    Enria was not backed by the Italian ruling League party's
representative within the European Parliament, the sources said.
    ""The League was very critical about Enria's position against
banking rules for easing credit criteria to small and
medium-sized businesses,"" one of the sources said, asking not to
be identified since the procedure is not public.
    According to the second source, EU lawmakers underlined
Enria's international experience in its letter to ECB President
Mario Draghi. They said Donnery would offer a better gender

    Donnery has been seen for weeks as the favourite as she is
expected to enjoy German support after taking a no-nonsense
stance toward banks for hoarding massive piles of non-performing
loans, other sources said earlier.
    But Enria is also seen as a strong candidate for being tough
on bad loans, a major problem for banks in his native Italy, as

    The current head of the SSM, France's Daniele Nouy, is due
to step down when her term expires at the end of the year.
    An ECB spokesman declined to comment.
    The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs
Committee and the European Council must also approve the ECB's
choice of new SSM chief.

    DOES ANYONE LIKE EUROPE? (1027 GMT)
    Although today's rebound is gathering pace, it doesn't change the overall picture of Europe
being the least favourite region for investors.
    ""Europe remains by some distance the most out-of-favour region so far year-to-date,"" notes
Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. ""Global investors have chosen to vote with
their feet."" 
    ""Outflows - which cumulatively totalled a cool 21 billion euros in September - were across
the board in equity, bond, and alternative assets.""
    The earnings season so far isn't giving much of a reason for investors to come back into the
region either. 
    Morgan Stanley earlier this week noted early indications of a weaker earnings season - with
more EPS misses than beats for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
    Analysts at the U.S. bank also said it's unusual for earnings revisions to fall so sharply
so early in the season (see chart below).
    But are there still reasons to be hopeful? Raymond James' Bailey notes there are still signs
of improvement in euro zone consumer confidence and bank lending. He ends, ""it is better to be
greedy when others are fearful.""

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SNAPS LOSING STREAK AS LUXURY SHINES (0725 GMT)    
    European shares are finally bouncing back after suffering five straight days of losses,
their longest losing streak since January's sell-off, as corporate updates take centre stage.
    Luxury, recently hit by worries over a slowdown in China and rich valuations, is clearly in
the spotlight after strong sales figures from Kering <PRTP.PA> that showed demand for Gucci
handbags proved more resilient than expected in the third quarter, even though it fell from
recent highs. [nL8N1X36I1]
    Shares in Kering are shooting up 10 percent, on track for its best day since early 2009 and
one of the top gainers in Europe, while rivals too are enjoying a nice bounce: LVMH <LVMH.PA> is
up more than 2 percent. Other top gainers in Europe such as razor and pen maker BIC <BICP.PA>,
oilfield services firm Saipem <SPMI.MI> and aerodefence group Safran <SAF.PA> are rising
following their earnings update. 
    Not all earning updates were well received: Boliden <BOL.ST> is tumbling 9 percent after
lower metal prices dented profits.  [nASP0001MY]

    WILL EARNINGS HELP LIFT MORALE? (0655 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to rise at the open although it is not clear at this stage
whether it will only be a limited and technical rebound. That will depend pretty much how
today’s new batch of corporate results are digested by the market. 
    One probable piece of good news is Kering, which is set for big gains at the open after its
results. 
    It’s also a big day for banking shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe. 
    Deutsche Bank announced a steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track to
swing to a profit this year. 
    Nordea also had a weak quarter and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity. Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned
to cut at least 1,600 jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter operating
profit slightly above market expectations. 
    In the UK, Barclays reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as its under-pressure
investment banking division booked increased trading revenues despite difficult market
conditions.
    Still in financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose. 
    Heineken is also a big one with sales at the world’s second largest brewer rising in Q3. 
    In the tech sector, which got a beating yesterday and is also close to bear market
territory, STMicro Q3 profits rose on strong automotive, imaging sales. Other blue chips
reporting include France’s Safran and Edenred, Spain’s Iberdrola as well as Norway's Telenor and
Norsk Hydro. 
    Also, in what could be a blow to one of the most high-profile Franco-German tie-up, sources
told Reuters that Siemens and Alstom will receive a warning this week from European Union
antitrust regulators that their plan to create a rail champion will hurt competition.

    * Fresh setbacks could further weaken her national coalition
    * Greens aim for role as Germany's dominant centrist party
    * Three-way coalitions likely to become new norm in Germany

    By Paul Carrel and Douglas Busvine
    BERLIN/OFFENBACH, Germany, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Branding
themselves as the party of reason, Germany's Greens are budding
kingmakers in an election in the state of Hesse on Sunday that
promises the second thumping in as many weeks for conservative
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her ruling allies.
    The environmentalist Greens are building on momentum that
saw them come second in a state election in Bavaria on Oct. 14.
They are carving out a role as Germany's dominant centrist
party, which promises to shake up national coalition politics.
    Born in 1980 out of the ecologist movement of the late 1960s
and 1970s, the Greens are now very much part of Germany's
establishment, drawing voters fed up with infighting in Merkel's
awkward left-right coalition, mainly over curbing immigration.
    ""We are the only party that hasn't been driven crazy by
right-wing populism,"" Tarek Al-Wazir, the Greens' half-Yemeni
leader in Hesse, told 200 voters during a question-and-answer
session on Monday in Offenbach, just outside Frankfurt.
    Like Al-Wazir, Hesse evokes diversity: almost a third of its
6.2 million population is of a migrant background. It was also
the first state where the Greens entered government, teaming up
under Joschka Fischer with the Social Democrats in 1985.
    Sunday's election in Hesse, which includes the financial and
banking hub Frankfurt, may produce another first for the Greens.
    So popular is 47-year-old Al-Wazir - voters prefer him to
all other party leaders in Hesse - that there is a slim chance
of him becoming state premier after running a campaign focused
on pragmatism and his record as the state's economy minister.
    ""We believe it's important to talk about common sense in the
time of Trump,"" he said at Monday evening's two-hour session, at
which he switched easily between touting his policy achievements
and fielding questions on national and international issues.
    His pragmatic pitch is resonating. In Hesse, opinion polls
show the Greens are competing for second place with the
centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Merkel's conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) still lead, but with reduced support.
    Nationally, the Greens are polling in second place.
    ""The realignment of the German party system is in full
swing, and the Greens are in pole position to take over the role
as the new, truly centrist force,"" said Carsten Nickel, managing
director at Teneo Intelligence, a consultancy.
    
    NEW NORM
    Polls suggest the incumbent CDU/Greens government in Hesse -
a political match-up that itself was unheard of until recently -
may lack sufficient support to remain in power, opening up 
other potential coalition options involving the Greens.
    The CDU and Greens could team up with the business-friendly
Free Democrats (FDP); the Greens, SPD and FDP could, in theory,
join forces - though the FDP is not keen; or the Greens and SPD
could work with the far-left Linke.
    Under the latter two options, Al-Wazir could be premier. He
is not committing to any coalition until after the vote.
    ""Three-way coalitions will become the norm in Germany,"" said
Jan Techau at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a
think-tank.
    In Hesse, the Greens and SPD are tied on 21 percent support,
behind the CDU on 26 percent, a survey by pollster INSA for Bild
newspaper showed on Tuesday. The far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) was on 13 percent.
    Another poll last week put the Greens just ahead of the SPD.
    The polling reflects growing disenchantment with Merkel's
conservatives and the SPD - allies in her national government.
At the last Hesse election, in 2013, the CDU won 38.3 percent of
the vote, the SPD 30.7 percent and the Greens just 11.1 percent.
    A poor outcome for Merkel's CDU in Hesse, after her Bavarian
CSU allies suffered their worst result since 1950 two weeks ago,
would turbo-charge a debate about who succeeds her and when. She
has been chancellor for 13 years.
    ""So far, no obvious challenger has emerged, which is the
main reason why she is still in power,"" said Techau.
    But a poor CDU performance in Hesse would embolden Merkel's
enemies before her party's annual congress in December, when she
will seek re-election as chairwoman. Trying to shore up CDU
support, she is making four campaign stops in Hesse this week.
    Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already
come close to collapsing twice, and a weak SPD performance in
Hesse could reignite a debate in the party about whether it
should pull out of the coalition.
    ""The one thing that ties the SPD to Merkel is its fear of
virtual extinction in new (national) elections,"" said Nickel.
    The conservative CDU/CSU allies only formed their loveless
national alliance with the SPD in March after talks on a
three-way coalition of the conservatives, Greens and FDP
collapsed. Merkel has ruled three times with the SPD and once
with the FDP.
    Now the Greens are looking to the Hesse vote to make
themselves indispensable to any government. ""We want to make
sure that nobody can manage without us,"" said Al-Wazir.

2140,5209,fea41bebad368bb09b623968018aed94,Germany warns citizens against online criticism of Erdogan in Turkey,2018-10-24 19:36:15,EUR,0,2018-10-24 19:36:46,{'EUR': 'Positive'},"    BERLIN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Germany has warned citizens
visiting Turkey to be extra cautious about their social media
feeds in response to a spate of cases of Germans arrested for
online criticism of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's
government.
    The updated travel advice, published by the Foreign Ministry
on Tuesday, highlights how Berlin's attempts to repair relations
with Ankara have have so far delivered little for dozens of
German citizens imprisoned there since the failed coup in 2016.
    Hundreds of people died in the overnight putsch attempt,
which was followed by a vast security crackdown involving
thousands of arrests of alleged followers of exiled cleric
Fethullah Gulen, some of whom are German-Turkish dual citizens.
    Erdogan's government has accused the U.S.-based Gulen of
orchestrating the coup, something he has repeatedly denied.
    ""Arrests and prosecutions frequently related to social media
posts that were critical of the government,"" read the new travel
advice. ""In some cases merely 'liking' another's post of that
nature is enough,"" it adds.
    With Germany home to 3 million people of Turkish background,
relations been the two countries have always been complicated,
but they hit rock bottom in the wake of the post-coup round-up.
    A flurry of diplomatic activity, including a state visit by
Erdogan to Germany, has so far yielded little in the way of
reduced tensions, with Berlin deeply concerned at Ankara's
influence over Germany's Turkish community.
    The ministry added that even private comments could be
risky. ""Non-public comments on social media can be forwarded to
Turkish authorities via denunciations,"" it said. ""A conviction
for 'insulting the president' or 'spreading terrorist
propaganda' can lead to many years' imprisonment.""
    Social media have become the primary platform for political
opposition in Turkey, where traditional media are saturated with
positive coverage of Erdogan and his ministers.
    Turkish authorities have detained people who criticised a
military operation in Syria on social media and those who posted
comments about the economy ""in a provocative way"", as the lira
tumbled against the dollar this year. [nL8N1PJ1N5] [nI7N1V401M]
    Germany is has a large and growing community of exiled 
critics of Erdogan, many of whom Ankara wants to see extradited
on terrorism charges. Some complain they are subject to
surveillance by Turkey's intelligence services.

    MEASURING THE BEAR: NEARLY $6 TRILLION WIPED FROM GLOBAL STOCKS (1152 GMT)
    The bear is digging its claws in - and though today's a slightly brighter day for European
stocks, U.S. futures are down 0.4 to 0.5 percent indicating a weaker start on Wall Street. Risk
appetite, even when it returns briefly, still looks hesitant and faltering.
    Even amid Europe's rebound, there are persistent signs of weakness: Italy's bank stocks
index has just hit a 22-month low on worries over a showdown with the European Commission.
    Taking the measure of global stocks, it's clear how much damage this year has caused. 
    Some $5.7 trillion has been wiped off the MSCI All-Country World Index's market
capitalisation since its January peak, as you can see below. That's 11.5 percent of the January
total that's evaporated as investors grew increasingly bearish.

    BERLIN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Germany has warned citizens
visiting Turkey to be extra cautious about their social media
feeds in response to a spate of cases of Germans arrested for
online criticism of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's
government.
    The updated travel advice, published by the Foreign Ministry
on Tuesday, highlights how Berlin's attempts to repair relations
with Ankara have so far delivered little for dozens of German
citizens imprisoned there since the failed coup in 2016.
    Hundreds of people died in the overnight putsch attempt,
which was followed by a vast security crackdown involving
thousands of arrests of alleged followers of exiled cleric
Fethullah Gulen, some of whom are German-Turkish dual citizens.
    Erdogan's government has accused the U.S.-based Gulen of
orchestrating the coup, something he has repeatedly denied.
    ""Arrests and prosecutions frequently related to social media
posts that were critical of the government,"" read the new travel
advice. ""In some cases merely 'liking' another's post of that
nature is enough,"" it adds.
    With Germany home to 3 million people of Turkish background,
relations been the two countries have always been complicated,
but they hit rock bottom in the wake of the post-coup round-up.
    A flurry of diplomatic activity, including a state visit by
Erdogan to Germany, has so far yielded little in the way of
reduced tensions, with Berlin deeply concerned at Ankara's
influence over Germany's Turkish community.
    The ministry added that even private comments could be
risky. ""Non-public comments on social media can be forwarded to
Turkish authorities via denunciations,"" it said. ""A conviction
for 'insulting the president' or 'spreading terrorist
propaganda' can lead to many years' imprisonment.""
    Social media have become the primary platform for political
opposition in Turkey, where traditional media are saturated with
positive coverage of Erdogan and his ministers.
    Turkish authorities have detained people who criticised a
military operation in Syria on social media and those who posted
comments about the economy ""in a provocative way"", as the lira
tumbled against the dollar this year. [nL8N1PJ1N5] [nI7N1V401M]
    Germany is has a large and growing community of exiled 
critics of Erdogan, many of whom Ankara wants to see extradited
on terrorism charges. Some complain they are subject to
surveillance by Turkey's intelligence services.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Kering’s upbeat
view on Chinese demand sparked a rally in high-end stocks. But
the group has so far been less vulnerable to economic swings
than rivals thanks to its social media savvy. And the outlook
for spending may be less rosy if China’s consumer confidence is
any guide.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - French luxury fashion group Kering on Oct. 23 reported
third-quarter revenue of 3.4 billion euros, up 27.5 percent from
a year earlier on a comparable basis. Analysts had on average
expected an increase of 22 percent, according to Berenberg. 
    - Kering's financial director Jean-Marc Duplaix told an
analyst conference call that the group's main brands, which also
include Saint Laurent, had their best quarter yet this year in
terms of the pace of sales growth in mainland China. Duplaix
confirmed that assumptions of around 25 percent sales growth in
the fourth quarter would not be far off.
    - Kering’s share price was up 7.7 percent to 380.30 euros at
1050 GMT on Oct. 24, leading a rally in the luxury goods sector.
Rivals such as Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, the industry's biggest
conglomerate, Britain's Burberry, and Italian puffer jacket
maker Moncler rose by between 3 percent and 9 percent.

    The bear is digging its claws in - and though today's a slightly brighter day for European
stocks, U.S. futures are down 0.4 to 0.5 percent indicating a weaker start on Wall Street. Risk
appetite, even when it returns briefly, still looks hesitant and faltering.
    Even amid Europe's rebound, there are persistent signs of weakness: Italy's bank stocks
index has just hit a 22-month low on worries over a showdown with the European Commission.
    Taking the measure of global stocks, it's clear how much damage this year has caused. 
    Some $5.7 trillion has been wiped off the MSCI All-Country World Index's market
capitalisation since its January peak, as you can see below. That's 11.5 percent of the January

    DOES ANYONE LIKE EUROPE? (1027 GMT)
    Although today's rebound is gathering pace, it doesn't change the overall picture of Europe
being the least favourite region for investors.
    ""Europe remains by some distance the most out-of-favour region so far year-to-date,"" notes
Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. ""Global investors have chosen to vote with
their feet."" 
    ""Outflows - which cumulatively totalled a cool 21 billion euros in September - were across
the board in equity, bond, and alternative assets.""
    The earnings season so far isn't giving much of a reason for investors to come back into the
region either. 
    Morgan Stanley earlier this week noted early indications of a weaker earnings season - with
more EPS misses than beats for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
    Analysts at the U.S. bank also said it's unusual for earnings revisions to fall so sharply
so early in the season (see chart below).
    But are there still reasons to be hopeful? Raymond James' Bailey notes there are still signs
of improvement in euro zone consumer confidence and bank lending. He ends, ""it is better to be
greedy when others are fearful.""

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SNAPS LOSING STREAK AS LUXURY SHINES (0725 GMT)    
    European shares are finally bouncing back after suffering five straight days of losses,
their longest losing streak since January's sell-off, as corporate updates take centre stage.
    Luxury, recently hit by worries over a slowdown in China and rich valuations, is clearly in
the spotlight after strong sales figures from Kering <PRTP.PA> that showed demand for Gucci
handbags proved more resilient than expected in the third quarter, even though it fell from
recent highs. [nL8N1X36I1]
    Shares in Kering are shooting up 10 percent, on track for its best day since early 2009 and
one of the top gainers in Europe, while rivals too are enjoying a nice bounce: LVMH <LVMH.PA> is
up more than 2 percent. Other top gainers in Europe such as razor and pen maker BIC <BICP.PA>,
oilfield services firm Saipem <SPMI.MI> and aerodefence group Safran <SAF.PA> are rising
following their earnings update. 
    Not all earning updates were well received: Boliden <BOL.ST> is tumbling 9 percent after
lower metal prices dented profits.  [nASP0001MY]

    WILL EARNINGS HELP LIFT MORALE? (0655 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to rise at the open although it is not clear at this stage
whether it will only be a limited and technical rebound. That will depend pretty much how
today’s new batch of corporate results are digested by the market. 
    One probable piece of good news is Kering, which is set for big gains at the open after its
results. 
    It’s also a big day for banking shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe. 
    Deutsche Bank announced a steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track to
swing to a profit this year. 
    Nordea also had a weak quarter and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity. Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned
to cut at least 1,600 jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter operating
profit slightly above market expectations. 
    In the UK, Barclays reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as its under-pressure
investment banking division booked increased trading revenues despite difficult market
conditions.
    Still in financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose. 
    Heineken is also a big one with sales at the world’s second largest brewer rising in Q3. 
    In the tech sector, which got a beating yesterday and is also close to bear market
territory, STMicro Q3 profits rose on strong automotive, imaging sales. Other blue chips
reporting include France’s Safran and Edenred, Spain’s Iberdrola as well as Norway's Telenor and
Norsk Hydro. 
    Also, in what could be a blow to one of the most high-profile Franco-German tie-up, sources
told Reuters that Siemens and Alstom will receive a warning this week from European Union
antitrust regulators that their plan to create a rail champion will hurt competition.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES OPEN IN THE BLACK (0625 GMT) 
    European futures have opened in positive territory and are clearing the way for some kind of
a rebound it seems. Our earlier indications from some spreadbetters were that the CAC and the
DAX would open in the red.
 
 
   (Julien Ponthus)
    *****   
    
    NO REBOUND IN SIGHT (0540 GMT)
    After five sessions in the red in a row and hitting two years low, there is still no rebound
in sight for European shares. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 147 points lower and Paris' CAC to
lose 74 points. An expection perhaps for London with the FTSE expected to open 69 points higher.

    But are there still reasons to be hopeful? Raymond James' Bailey notes there are still signs
of improvement in euro zone consumer confidence and bank lending. He ends, ""it is better to be
greedy when others are fearful.""

    OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SNAPS LOSING STREAK AS LUXURY SHINES (0725 GMT)    
    European shares are finally bouncing back after suffering five straight days of losses,
their longest losing streak since January's sell-off, as corporate updates take centre stage.
    Luxury, recently hit by worries over a slowdown in China and rich valuations, is clearly in
the spotlight after strong sales figures from Kering <PRTP.PA> that showed demand for Gucci
handbags proved more resilient than expected in the third quarter, even though it fell from
recent highs. [nL8N1X36I1]
    Shares in Kering are shooting up 10 percent, on track for its best day since early 2009 and
one of the top gainers in Europe, while rivals too are enjoying a nice bounce: LVMH <LVMH.PA> is
up more than 2 percent. Other top gainers in Europe such as razor and pen maker BIC <BICP.PA>,
oilfield services firm Saipem <SPMI.MI> and aerodefence group Safran <SAF.PA> are rising
following their earnings update. 
    Not all earning updates were well received: Boliden <BOL.ST> is tumbling 9 percent after
lower metal prices dented profits.  [nASP0001MY]

    WILL EARNINGS HELP LIFT MORALE? (0655 GMT) 
    European shares are expected to rise at the open although it is not clear at this stage
whether it will only be a limited and technical rebound. That will depend pretty much how
today’s new batch of corporate results are digested by the market. 
    One probable piece of good news is Kering, which is set for big gains at the open after its
results. 
    It’s also a big day for banking shares with the sector deep in bear territory in Europe. 
    Deutsche Bank announced a steep decline in third quarter profit but said it was on track to
swing to a profit this year. 
    Nordea also had a weak quarter and reported a steeper-than-expected fall profit, citing
difficult market conditions and lower corporate activity. Sweden's Handelsbanken said it planned
to cut at least 1,600 jobs over the coming four years as it reported third-quarter operating
profit slightly above market expectations. 
    In the UK, Barclays reported a profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds as its under-pressure
investment banking division booked increased trading revenues despite difficult market
conditions.
    Still in financials, reinsurer Scor's Q3 profit rose. 
    Heineken is also a big one with sales at the world’s second largest brewer rising in Q3. 
    In the tech sector, which got a beating yesterday and is also close to bear market
territory, STMicro Q3 profits rose on strong automotive, imaging sales. Other blue chips
reporting include France’s Safran and Edenred, Spain’s Iberdrola as well as Norway's Telenor and
Norsk Hydro. 
    Also, in what could be a blow to one of the most high-profile Franco-German tie-up, sources
told Reuters that Siemens and Alstom will receive a warning this week from European Union
antitrust regulators that their plan to create a rail champion will hurt competition.

    EUROPEAN FUTURES OPEN IN THE BLACK (0625 GMT) 
    European futures have opened in positive territory and are clearing the way for some kind of
a rebound it seems. Our earlier indications from some spreadbetters were that the CAC and the
DAX would open in the red.

    *****   
    
    NO REBOUND IN SIGHT (0540 GMT)
    After five sessions in the red in a row and hitting two years low, there is still no rebound
in sight for European shares. 
    Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt's DAX to open 147 points lower and Paris' CAC to
lose 74 points. An expection perhaps for London with the FTSE expected to open 69 points higher.

around 2 percent this year, the country's influential think tank
IOBE projected in a quarterly review on Wednesday, sticking to a
previous forecast.
    The Foundation of Economic and Industrial Research
(IOBE)said increased export activity was the main driver,
expecting  consumer spending to pick up in the second half on
improved expectations.
    IOBE sees the 180 billion-euro economy expanding by about
2.4 percent in 2019, helped by a projected 12 to 14 percent rise
in investments and a projected 1.4 percent increase in private
consumption.
    Stronger domestic demand will be manifested in imports which
are seen rising by 6 to 6.5 percent.
    Greece, which emerged from its last bailout programme in
August, has been growing for six straight quarters after
expanding 1.5 percent in 2017. [nL8N1VP1VF] 
    ""An eight-year cycle during which the economy went through
three successive support programmes was completed in August. The
significant balancing of the economy that was achieved should
not be underestimated,"" said IOBE Chief Nikos Vettas.
    Without the security of bailout programmes and access to
capital markets not yet attained, it was of central importance
when access will be achieved and on what terms, given that the
economy's financing is currently anaemic, he said.
    ""The existence of a safety cushion should not lead to
complacency. The more the period of non-normal financing is
prolonged, the chances that normal funding will take place with
discomfort increase.""

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Private equity firm HarbourVest
said on Wednesday it will open a Dublin office to help minimise
any disruption to its clients and funds from Britain leaving the
European Union (EU) next year.
    HarbourVest, which has $50 billion in assets under
management and more than 400 employees, is not planning to
reduce the size of its London office but will have fund managers
in Dublin, its managing director John Toomey said.
    Many firms without regulated EU operations outside Britain
are working on the assumption of a ""hard Brexit"", where they
will no longer be able to sell their services across the EU
without an operation regulated by an EU member country.
    Disagreement over what to do about the Irish border after
Britain leaves the EU has stalled a Brexit deal in recent weeks.
 
    Some investment management firms with a base in Britain are
opening offices on the continent as part of plans to ensure they
can sell to EU clients after Britain exits the bloc.
    HarbourVest said it will open the Dublin office once it has
Irish AIFM (Alternative Investment Fund Managers) authorisation.
    Blackstone <BX.N> is among a number of financial services
companies to have chosen Luxembourg as the site for a European
Union subsidiary while several hedge funds, including Winton,
have opted for Dublin.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

    By Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - An uncompromising challenge to
EU budget rules by Italy is providing the first big test for
reforms introduced to save the euro zone nine years ago as
financial crisis threatened to tear it apart.
    The reforms remain a work in progress, and in urgent need of
fuller implementation before the bloc's next crisis strikes.
    But the defiance from Rome that has locked it into an
unprecedented standoff with Brussels - and given fresh legs to a
discredited image of financially responsible northern euro zone
nations pitted against a profligate south - seems certain to
delay that process and probably dilute it for good.
    In May 2010, the then 16 countries sharing the euro clubbed
together to create a rescue fund whose first task was to save
Greece from going bust.
    The ensuing bailout programme, only concluded in August when
the country exited its third rescue package, produced a
consensus that closer economic cooperation was needed to better
protect the system against future shocks.
    With that in mind, euro zone states are now moving towards
giving their bailout fund new powers of economic monitoring.
    They also aim to strengthen a second fund designed to
protect the banking system, extend national guarantee schemes
for bank deposits across the whole currency bloc and introduce a
euro zone budget.
    Germany and its neighbours insist that, before they take on
more bloc-wide financial commitments, financial risks within it
must be substantially reduced.
    But as a populist government in debt-laden Italy lays out
plans to spend more borrowed money in clear contravention of EU
rules, the deposit scheme and euro zone budget are becoming a
more distant prospects.
    ""It is going to be more difficult now. When you talk about
deposit insurance, the appetite is smaller. Italy is an
additional argument not to even think about it,"" one senior euro
zone official said.
    The EU is due to present the next phase of the integration
package in December - and officials expect it to underwhelm.
    ""We are still heading for some minimalist package of
reforms. We are going to get some ESM (bailout fund)
strengthening, we are going to get the backstop to the Bank
Resolution Fund and not a lot more,"" a second senior official
said.
    ""The idea of a euro zone fiscal capacity does not seem to
have a lot of viability, I am sceptical whether it will
translate into something in reality,"" the second official said.
    
    DISCIPLINE BY MARKETS
    Italy's refusal to keep in check its bloated public finances
also ruins the positive impression that southern countries -
notably the bloc's third sovereign bailout recipient Portugal -
made with reforms that helped counter the German focus on more
fiscal discipline.
    And it might bring back discussions, championed by Berlin,
about setting up a debt restructuring mechanism for countries
that lose market access - a fate that could theoretically befall
Italy if investors begin to doubt its ability to repay a debt
pile equivalent to 133 percent of GDP.
    ""My fear is that because of the situation in Italy, Germany
can say that market discipline is a good thing because the (EU)
Commission cannot enforce the rules,"" a third official said.
    ""Maybe this can also start to convince France, if we have
countries that deliberately break the rules and don't really
care about the Stability and Growth Pact (on fiscal discipline)
any more,"" he said.
    But while officials agree that ultimately only the markets
hold the power to force Italy to change its fiscal policy - a
view shared by the government in Rome - leaving it only to
investors to exert pressure could be dangerous.
    ""The markets will discipline irresponsible behaviour, but
they do it very late and they do it in a very extreme way,"" the
second official said.
    The Pact requires governments to cut their structural
deficits, which exclude one-offs and business cycle swings,
every year until the books are balanced. Public debt must be cut
every year too.
    If they don't, the Commission can start disciplinary steps
that can end in fines -- a prospect Rome now faces if it ignores
the Commission's demand to change the 2019 budget so that the
structural gap falls rather than rises. 
    Italy has no supporters among other euro zone governments.
    But with the challenge to Brussels having enhanced the
popularity of ruling coalition heads Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di
Maio among domestic voters, it is still unlikely to yield.
    Unless markets force them to, they certainly have no
incentive to back down before European Parliament elections in
May, officials believe.
    This makes the current clash far more dangerous for Brussels
and supporters of closer economic integration than previous
spats over fiscal policy with France, Spain or Portugal, or
indeed previous Italian administrations, a fourth official said.
    ""In the past, we had to deal with governments breaking EU
rules but at least willing to cooperate. In the case of Italy,
we have an uncooperative government,"" the official said.

    By Huw Jones
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    The European Commission had no comment.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

    By Kate Holton
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Transport company
boss Chris Blackburn is contemplating spending almost a million
pounds for a chance to keep his trucks on European roads if
Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March.
    Upgrading the emissions standards of his fleet would allow
him to compete for the 984 annual European travel permits
allocated for British trucks next year.
    Competition will be fierce. Some 38,000 British trucks
routinely drive in the EU and, if there is no Brexit deal, they
will only be able to carry on with a permit. Britain's EU
membership meant they have never needed one before. 
     Even if Blackburn funds the upgrade, there is no guarantee
the government will consider his business, moving industrial and
construction equipment, important enough to give him permits.
    Losing access would put a major strain on his 93-year-old
family firm, Chambers & Cook, which has annual revenue of around
20 million pounds.
    With barely five months to go, Britain has yet to agree exit
terms and companies do not know how they will trade with the
world's largest trading bloc.
     Blackburn's predicament highlights the uncertainty of an
industry which moves around 420 billion pounds ($547 billion) of
goods between Britain and Europe each year to support
manufacturers, retailers and even musicians.    
    ""No or too few permits would be catastrophic,"" the
53-year-old said at his Birmingham base, overlooking the M6
motorway.
    ""It is a gamble. It's a massive cost."" 
    Many businesses are preparing for the worst, a no-deal where
newly installed customs checks delay the movement of goods,
leading to tailbacks and shattering cross-border supply chains. 
    For the haulage and freight industry that means applying for
permits and international driving licences, increasing warehouse
space in Britain and Europe, ramping up customs capabilities and
looking into European vehicle registration. 
    They are also trialling different ports in case Dover,
Britain's main gateway to Europe, becomes gridlocked, delaying
the daily movement of up to 16,000 trucks. 
    Under government plans, two motorways and an airport in the
south of England will be used as car parks if needed. 
    ""Every hour that a vehicle is standing costs 50 pounds
because they're not earning,"" Richard Burnett, chief executive
of the Road Haulage Association told Reuters. ""Within weeks we
would see haulage companies go out of business.""
    The government says it is confident of securing a deal but
that the industry should prepare to use permits. It will also
seek new bilateral agreements as quickly as possible if needed. 
  
    
    JUGGLING RESOURCES
    For Blackburn, the priority is to get his company into shape
to win as many permits as possible, so he can then juggle his
resources by, for instance, allowing a driver set for Europe to
pick up a permit from one returning to the UK. 
   The annual ECMT permits are issued by the International
Transport Forum each year for travel in 43 countries including
Russia, Turkey, Albania and Armenia and EU member states. 
    The annual permits, only for trucks meeting Euro 6 emissions
standards, have rarely been used by British trucks as they
typically only travel in the EU. Britain will allocate them to
hauliers based on goods and travel frequency.
    Chambers & Cook sends up to 20 trucks into Europe a day,
mostly through Dover but it also has operations in the north
east port of Immingham.
    While the vast majority of goods go via Dover's fast
roll-on, roll-off ships, Immingham and other ports offer
unaccompanied trade, where loaded trailers are picked up around
the country, dropped at the port and left to be loaded onto
European-bound vessels. 
    The service is slower and limited in its capacity however,
but the fact that hauliers used to fast trade are considering
such options show the level of concern. 
    James Colson, overseeing Brexit planning for Yusen Logistics
and its 2,000 UK staff, could use Portsmouth and Poole on the
south coast for France and the Iberian peninsula, or Harwich,
Hull, and Newcastle for northern Europe and Scandinavia.
    ""They're already pretty full, hence why we're starting now,""
he said, of their early trials. 
    Colson hopes to get permits as Yusen moves goods for
mainstream sectors including automotive, aerospace,
pharmaceuticals, and retail.
    
    ALARM
    Businesses operating in more niche areas are worried that
they will not be considered important enough for the permits. 
    Transam Trucking's fleet of black trucks are built for
moving the stages, screens and sound equipment used by the likes
of U2, Elton John and Iron Maiden.
    ""People are looking for tours next summer and customers are
asking questions,"" Transam's Natasha Highcroft told Reuters.  
     Only 60 of Transam's 150 trucks are Euro 6 emissions
standard so this would also limit permit use. The value of the
goods they move, and the tight timeframes required, mean they
could not do unaccompanied shipping.    
    David Rogers and his family-owned EM Rogers moves cars all
over Europe for testing. He hopes they would be a priority due
to Britain's leading role in the global automotive chain, but
nothing is clear. ""It's frightening,"" he said. ""There aren't
many people who can do what we're doing"".
    Rogers has a business in the Netherlands and could increase
the number of lorries registered there, but that is not an
option available to many. 
    The alarm comes at a difficult time for the industry, with
many British firms saying they have struggled to compete against
European companies with cheaper labour and diesel. 
    Supporters of leaving the EU have always acknowledged it
could cause short term disruption but say ultimately Britain
will be freed of red tape and able to trade more widely. A
survey of truck drivers taken before the 2016 referendum showed
a majority backed Brexit.
    Blackburn, talking next to photographs showing Chambers &
Cook trucks from the 1960s and 1970s, said he could not
understand why politicians were taking so long to agree a deal.
    ""They've had a lot of time and haven't achieved anything,""
he said. ""As it's looking like there's a significant chance of
no deal, our current plan is to assume that happens.""

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The European Union might grant
temporary permission for clearing houses in Britain to continue
serving EU customers if there is a no-deal Brexit next March, an
EU document seen by Reuters showed.
    LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> clears the
bulk of euro-denominated derivatives, contracts used by
companies and banks to shield themselves against unexpected
moves in currencies and interest rates.
    But customers in the bloc would not be allowed to use LCH or
other UK-based clearing houses if Britain crashed out of the EU
without agreeing a deal, putting at risk contracts with a
nominal value of trillions of euros.
    ""As regards cleared derivatives, it appears that there might
be potential risks to financial stability in a no deal
scenario,"" the undated document, which sets out the European
Commission's draft contingency plans in case of a no-deal
Brexit, said.
    ""On this basis, the Commission will continue to assess the
situation and take the necessary measures to mitigate risks in
this area,"" it added.
    Financial industry bodies such as ISDA want the EU to
authorise LCH to continue clearing euro-denominated contracts in
time for next March to avoid potential disruption.
    But such measures would be aimed at facilitating ""a
transition to achieving sufficient capacity within the EU"", the
document said.
    Granting temporary authorisation for LCH and other clearers
in London to continue serving EU customers would give euro one
rivals such as Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> Eurex in Frankfurt
time to absorb chunks of derivatives positions from Britain.
    Transferring positions from one jurisdiction to another has
never been done in a short time on a large scale before, and is
a cumbersome process.
    The European Commission had no comment.
    
    SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED
    The document is the clearest sign yet that Brussels is
willing to take steps to mitigate a no-deal Brexit despite 
public silence in the face of increasingly strident calls from
the Bank of England and market participants for joint action.
    A senior UK regulator has said privately that persuading its
counterpart, the European Central Bank, to back EU action
publicly is proving to be very hard.
    The BoE wants Brussels to mirror measures that Britain is
taking to ease market concerns by allowing cross-border clearing
to continue, and for derivatives and insurance contracts to
remain valid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
    But EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said last
week that the priority is for the EU and Britain to agree on a
divorce settlement and transition period, which would do away
with the need for no-Brexit deal measures.
    Britain and EU leaders failed to make sufficient progress at
a summit last week, and future arrangements for the border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland remain a major sticking point.
    The document said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit to
financial stability has ""already diminished significantly"" as
banks and insurers adjust contracts or move activities to new
hubs in the EU.
    The document said that cross-border insurance contracts
would ""remain valid and the performance of existing obligations
under the contract would generally continue to take place"".
    ""The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority
is working with national authorities to address residual risks
for certain EU27 policyholders,"" it said.
    Cross-border bilateral or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
contracts that are not cleared will also ""in principle remain
valid and can in almost all cases be executed until maturity"",
the document said.
    ""In view of this assessment, adoption of mitigating measures
in these two areas is not part of the Commission's contingency
planning.""

    * Rome in for long haul in challenge to EU budget rules

    * Talks on debt restructuring methods may get second life

    By Jan Strupczewski
    BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - An uncompromising challenge to
EU budget rules by Italy is providing the first big test for
reforms introduced to save the euro zone nine years ago as
financial crisis threatened to tear it apart.
    The reforms remain a work in progress, and in urgent need of
fuller implementation before the bloc's next crisis strikes.
    But the defiance from Rome that has locked it into an
unprecedented standoff with Brussels - and given fresh legs to a
discredited image of financially responsible northern euro zone
nations pitted against a profligate south - seems certain to
delay that process and probably dilute it for good.
    In May 2010, the then 16 countries sharing the euro clubbed
together to create a rescue fund whose first task was to save
Greece from going bust.
    The ensuing bailout programme, only concluded in August when
the country exited its third rescue package, produced a
consensus that closer economic cooperation was needed to better
protect the system against future shocks.
    With that in mind, euro zone states are now moving towards
giving their bailout fund new powers of economic monitoring.
    They also aim to strengthen a second fund designed to
protect the banking system, extend national guarantee schemes
for bank deposits across the whole currency bloc and introduce a
euro zone budget.
    Germany and its neighbours insist that, before they take on
more bloc-wide financial commitments, financial risks within it
must be substantially reduced.
    But as a populist government in debt-laden Italy lays out
plans to spend more borrowed money in clear contravention of EU
rules, the deposit scheme and euro zone budget are becoming a
more distant prospects.
    ""It is going to be more difficult now. When you talk about
deposit insurance, the appetite is smaller. Italy is an
additional argument not to even think about it,"" one senior euro
zone official said.
    The EU is due to present the next phase of the integration
package in December - and officials expect it to underwhelm.
    ""We are still heading for some minimalist package of
reforms. We are going to get some ESM (bailout fund)
strengthening, we are going to get the backstop to the Bank
Resolution Fund and not a lot more,"" a second senior official
said.
    ""The idea of a euro zone fiscal capacity does not seem to
have a lot of viability, I am sceptical whether it will
translate into something in reality,"" the second official said.
    
    DISCIPLINE BY MARKETS
    Italy's refusal to keep in check its bloated public finances
also ruins the positive impression that southern countries -
notably the bloc's third sovereign bailout recipient Portugal -
made with reforms that helped counter the German focus on more
fiscal discipline.
    And it might bring back discussions, championed by Berlin,
about setting up a debt restructuring mechanism for countries
that lose market access - a fate that could theoretically befall
Italy if investors begin to doubt its ability to repay a debt
pile equivalent to 133 percent of GDP.
    ""My fear is that because of the situation in Italy, Germany
can say that market discipline is a good thing because the (EU)
Commission cannot enforce the rules,"" a third official said.
    ""Maybe this can also start to convince France, if we have
countries that deliberately break the rules and don't really
care about the Stability and Growth Pact (on fiscal discipline)
any more,"" he said.
    But while officials agree that ultimately only the markets
hold the power to force Italy to change its fiscal policy - a
view shared by the government in Rome - leaving it only to
investors to exert pressure could be dangerous.
    ""The markets will discipline irresponsible behaviour, but
they do it very late and they do it in a very extreme way,"" the
second official said.
    The Pact requires governments to cut their structural
deficits, which exclude one-offs and business cycle swings,
every year until the books are balanced. Public debt must be cut
every year too.
    If they don't, the Commission can start disciplinary steps
that can end in fines -- a prospect Rome now faces if it ignores
the Commission's demand to change the 2019 budget so that the
structural gap falls rather than rises. 
    Italy has no supporters among other euro zone governments.
    But with the challenge to Brussels having enhanced the
popularity of ruling coalition heads Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di
Maio among domestic voters, it is still unlikely to yield.
    Unless markets force them to, they certainly have no
incentive to back down before European Parliament elections in
May, officials believe.
    This makes the current clash far more dangerous for Brussels
and supporters of closer economic integration than previous
spats over fiscal policy with France, Spain or Portugal, or
indeed previous Italian administrations, a fourth official said.
    ""In the past, we had to deal with governments breaking EU
rules but at least willing to cooperate. In the case of Italy,
we have an uncooperative government,"" the official said.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> has
announced plans to intensify competition with rival London Stock
Exchange <LSE.L> ahead of Brexit, saying it would expand a
profit-sharing scheme.
    The Frankfurt-based exchange's Eurex Clearing said it will
expand its ""partnership"" programme to include repurchase or repo
agreements and foreign exchange traded among banks from the
first quarter of 2019.
    The more volume that users pass through Eurex, the bigger
share of profit they will get. It is similar to a long-standing
programme at the LSE's LCH unit, which dominates
euro-denominated clearing in Europe. [nL8N1MK137]
    Financial centres such as Frankfurt and Paris are vying to
win a share of London's financial market, Europe's biggest, as
UK-based financial firms shift some business to new EU hubs
ahead of Brexit.
    The aim of the repo programme is to increase choice and
efficiency for market participants in special repo and general
collateral instruments, and to grow in the dealer-to-client repo
business, Eurex said.
    LCH's Paris subsidiary clears repo-related business.
    Some EU policymakers want euro-denominated clearing moved
from London to the euro zone after Brexit.
    In the event of a no-deal Brexit, London would likely remain
a clearing centre for EU customers to give rivals like Eurex
time to build up capacity, an EU document indicated on
Wednesday. [nL8N1X5247]
    Eurex launched its programme a year ago to capture a chunk
of LCH's euro interest rate swaps business, though it is still
dwarfed by its London counterpart.
    The OTC FX market is still largely uncleared, Eurex said.
    ""Eurex Clearing is currently working with market
participants to be the first major clearinghouse to offer a
comprehensive cross-currency swap clearing service,"" it said in
a statement.
    Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley
have expressed an early interest to join both new segments,
Eurex said, adding that Citigroup, DekaBank and LBBW may
participate in the repo programme.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen and Swiss franc
gained only briefly on Thursday as currency traders showed
little reaction to a wave of selling across stock markets,
although China's offshore yuan hit a 22-month low on worries
about an economic slowdown.
    The euro recovered from Wednesday's two-month lows, before
the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting.
    Despite the downturn by stocks, worries about corporate
earnings growth and doubts about the global economy, forex
investors only tiptoed into the yen and Swiss franc, two
currencies historically bought during downturns [nL2N1X41ON].
    ""To a large extent, until today there had been a lack of
reaction in the FX markets. We are starting to see this come
through,"" said Christin Tuxen, FX strategist at Danske Bank.
    Relatively small currency swings reflected how recent data
had showed a ""loss of momentum in global growth"", Tuxen said,
rather than a risk of recession or something serious enough to
spook investors.
    The yen rose as high as 111.82 <JPY=> versus the dollar,
then retreated in European trading to settle at 112.275, flat on
the day.
    The Swiss franc gave up all its gains versus the dollar to
trade at 0.9982 <CHF=> and was down 0.2 percent against the euro
<EURCHF=>.
    The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1417 <EUR=>, up from its
two-month lows of $1.1378. The dollar index <.DXY> was off 0.1
percent at 96.333.
    The Australian dollar, often viewed as a bellwether for
global risk, rose 0.2 percent to $0.7074 <AUD=>. 
    However, in a sign that the worries about global growth and
particularly in China are beginning to bite, the offshore yuan
<CNH=> hit its weakest since the start of January 2017, down 0.3
percent on the day at 6.9668.
    
    ECB IN FOCUS
    Investors will be looking for any new guidance from the ECB
at its meeting later on Thursday on a possible slowdown in
growth, as well as the row between Brussels and Rome over
Italy's budget plans. [nL9N1T2012]
    The ECB is not expected to offer any surprises. Instead, it
will confirm that quantitative easing is on track to end next
year.
    Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note that after recent
falls in the single currency, euro/dollar may face a short
squeeze if the ECB was surprisingly bullish.
    ""The global economy is continuing to face higher inflation
and tightening capacity, suggesting that central banks may need
to continue tightening even in the face of rising market
volatility,"" they said. 
    Sterling recovered from six-week lows to $1.2906 <GBP=>
after British Prime Minister Theresa May received a show of
support from her Conservative Party before the next round of
Brexit talks [nL8N1X457G].

Link to Fitch Ratings' Report(s): European Money Market Fund Compare - August 
2018

https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10049781

Fitch Ratings-London-October 25: Fitch Ratings has published its end-August 2018 
money market fund (MMF) Compare, which covers in total about EUR0.5 trillion 
equivalent assets under management across 53 Fitch-rated MMFs. It is a European 
MMF interactive comparison tool that provides investor education and helps 
promote more informed investment decision-making following the European MMF 
reform implementation in July 2018.

The portfolio metrics in 'MMF Compare' are derived from Fitch's MMF rating 
surveillance process. Fitch receives regular portfolio holdings data from fund 
administrators and managers, which it cleans, standardises and enriches in 
accordance with a globally consistent rating methodology. These data serve as 
the basis for calculating key portfolio credit, market and liquidity risk 
metrics that Fitch uses when rating MMFs.

The MMF Compare is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link 
above.

factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains 
will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the

certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro was steady on Thursday
after the European Central Bank stuck to its plans for ending
bond purchases by the end of the year and as traders prepared
for President Mario Draghi's press conference.
    Investors will be looking for any new guidance from Draghi
on recent signs of a possible slowdown in euro zone growth, as
well as the row between Brussels and Rome over Italy's budget
plans. [nL8N1X522B] [nL9N1T2012]
    The ECB kept rates on hold and remains on course to claw
back unprecedented monetary stimulus even as the growth outlook
darkens.
    Morgan Stanley analysts said that after recent falls in the
single currency, euro/dollar may face a short squeeze if the ECB
and Draghi strike a surprisingly bullish tone.
    ""The global economy is continuing to face higher inflation
and tightening capacity, suggesting that central banks may need

    The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1409 <EUR=>, recovering
from two-month lows of $1.1378 hit on Wednesday. The dollar
index <.DXY> was off 0.1 percent at 96.333.
    Elsewhere, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained only
briefly as currency traders showed little reaction to a wave of

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 25: Deutsche Bank's 3Q18 earnings were weaker, both 
yoy and qoq, as the restructuring of the investment bank resulted in a weaker 
revenue base, says Fitch Ratings. The bank generated a 0.6% pre-tax return on 
risk-weighted assets (RWA) in the quarter and in 9M18, which is low compared 
with peers that have reported to date. Earnings are unlikely to improve for the 
full year, given seasonally weaker revenue and additional restructuring expenses 
expected in the fourth quarter. 

Revenues reduced significantly (-9% yoy and -6% qoq), affected by the bank's 
business exits, loss of market share in some segments and a weak trading 
environment in the main products and geographies of its Corporate and Investment 
Bank (CIB). Execution on cost targets has shown some success, but the bank will 
have to demonstrate that it can achieve its cost targets without affecting the 
franchise further. Stronger and more resilient revenues will also be required 
for earnings targets to be met. The Negative Outlook on the bank's 'BBB+' 
Long-Term Issuer Default Rating reflects our view that the bank continues to 
face challenges in reaching its strategic targets. 

Operating expenses declined moderately in 3Q18, by 1% qoq and 4% yoy, and 
management remains committed to its full-year cost target of EUR23 billion, 
adjusted for restructuring, litigation and impairments (of which EUR17.4 billion 
was incurred in 9M18) as well as further progress in 2019. Restructuring 
expenses were lower than anticipated in 9M18 and management expects that these 
will amount to EUR600 million for the full year, lower than initially indicated. 


Profitability was aided by continued very low loan impairment charges, which 
year-to date amount to a modest EUR273 million (9bp of loans at amortised cost) 
in a very favourable credit environment.

CIB's 3Q18 pre-tax profit declined 62% yoy, and on a net basis the division 
generated a weak return on tangible equity (RoTE) of only 1%. CIB revenue 
decreased 13% yoy, reflecting lower revenue across most businesses, with the 
notable exception of equity origination where the bank reported strong business 
flows. Fixed income sales and trading revenue decreased 15% yoy, driven by low 
volatility in rates in Europe and business exits from the US. Equities trading 
was affected by higher funding costs in prime finance, which is also an area the 
bank has been scaling back, and lower income from cash equities, while equity 
derivatives performed strongly. 

Within CIB, transaction banking undershot management's expectations as revenues 
decreased 5% yoy, because of modest underlying business developments and 
non-recurrence of revenue contribution from credit insurance recoveries. The 
bank remains committed to strengthening this business, including through 
stronger client coverage and cross-coverage with other CIB areas, but low 
interest rates continue to put pressure on earnings.

The Private and Commercial Bank's results were also modest, generating a 5% RoTE 
after a 37% yoy decline in pre-tax profit. Results were affected by higher 
investment spend, including in relation to strengthening the Italian and 
Portuguese businesses, and by the sale of the Polish and Portuguese retail 
operations. The increase in costs was not matched by revenue increases, which 
remain challenged by the low interest rate environment. The division targets a 
RoTE of 12% by 2021 but progress towards this target will likely be back-loaded, 
given the length of time it will take to achieve synergies from the integration 
of the retail businesses, and depending on the timing of interest rate rises.

The Asset Management division's pre-tax contribution to the group decreased 27% 
to EUR143 million, after the deduction of non-controlling interest  because of 
the non-recurrence of a prior year's gain. Underlying profitability at DWS (the 
entity corresponding to the division) improved yoy.

Deutsche Bank's fully-loaded CET1 ratio increased to 14% because of a decrease 
in RWA, driven by lower  credit and operational risk. The bank expects the ratio 
to decline because of regulatory adjustments, of which about 20bp-40bp are from 
the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) undertaken by the ECB, which 
should come through over the next year, and 20bp from a change in lease 
accounting. The 4% fully-loaded leverage ratio was stable compared with 
end-June, when improvements due to business volume reductions had already 
largely been incorporated. The bank confirmed its 4.5% leverage ratio target.

Liquidity remained comfortable, as reflected by a EUR254 billion liquidity 
buffer (EUR268 billion at carrying value) and 148% liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) at end-3Q18, which is an important rating driver. The bank's liquidity 
buffer decreased by EUR16 billion in the quarter, and it plans to reduce some of 
the excess liquidity that it built up in the aftermath of 4Q16, when it suffered 
some funding outflows. The bank has indicated that over time it would consider 
lowering the LCR to a level that is more in line with its peers. It was also 
considering having a lower proportion of the buffer invested in cash compared 
with the current 66% (62% based on carrying value) in order to remove some of 
the associated earnings drag. 

Fitch expects that the bank will continue to manage liquidity prudently and in 
accordance with its business model, which in our opinion is associated with a 
funding profile more sensitive to changes in market confidence, given the higher 
share of capital markets businesses and the ongoing restructuring.

ECB's statement issued after its policy meeting on Thursday: 
    
    Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we
decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We
continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at
least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as
necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
    Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will
continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase
programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of 15 billion euros
until the end of December 2018. We anticipate that, subject to
incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we
will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an
extended period of time after the end of our net asset
purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain
favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary
accommodation.
    Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected,
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion
of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation
pressures. The underlying strength of the economy continues to
support our confidence that the sustained convergence of
inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even
after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the
same time, uncertainties relating to protectionism,
vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market
volatility remain prominent. Significant monetary policy
stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of
domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments
over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided
by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the
sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated
reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key
ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands
ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure
that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s
inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail,
starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP
increased by 0.4 percent, quarter on quarter, in both the first
and the second quarter of 2018. Incoming information, while
somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with
our baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic
expansion, supported by domestic demand and continued
improvements in the labour market. Some recent sector-specific
developments are having an impact on the near-term growth
profile. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpin
domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing
employment growth and rising wages. At the same time, business
investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable
financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing
investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global
activity is expected to continue supporting euro area exports,
though at a slower pace.
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets
and financial market volatility remain prominent.
    Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1 percent in
September 2018, from 2.0 percent in August, reflecting mainly
higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current
futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are
likely to hover around the current level over the coming months.
While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted,
they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost
pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking
ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the
end of the year and to increase further over the medium term,
supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic
expansion and rising wage growth.
    Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth
stood at 3.5 percent in September 2018, after 3.4 percent in
August. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth
is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow
monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad
money growth.
    The growth of loans to the private sector strengthened
further, continuing the upward trend observed since the
beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to
non-financial corporations rose to 4.3 percent in September
2018, from 4.1 percent in August, while the annual growth rate
of loans to households stood at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the
previous month. The euro area bank lending survey for the third
quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be
supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and
favorable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and
loans for house purchase.
    The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in
place since June 2014 continues to significantly support
borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to
financing – in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises
– and credit flows across the euro area.
    To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic
analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis
confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is
still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over
the medium term.
    In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy
measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to
raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing
vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in
euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to
increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost
euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal
policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal
buffers. This is particularly important in countries where
government debt is high and for which full adherence to the
Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound
fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent
implementation of the EU’s fiscal and economic governance
framework over time and across countries remains essential to
bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the
functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority.
The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to
complete the banking union and the capital markets union.

its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course
to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates
sometime after next summer.
    Following are highlights of ECB President Mario Draghi's
comments at a post-policy meeting press conference.
    
    ITALY BONDS
    I don't have a crystal ball... These bonds are in the banks'
portfolios. They are denting in to the capital position of the
banks - that is obvious, that's what it is.  
    I'm still confident an agreement will be found. You have
dent in capital expenditure and then you have weakening funding
conditions as well and all this is going to translate into
different lending terms. 
    
    ITALY BUDGET
    On Italy, you have to remember that Italy is a fiscal
discussion, so there wasn't much discussion about Italy... Vice
President Dombrovskis was there, and I asked him permission to
quote him to what he said. He said of course, 'we have to
observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking a
dialogue.' 

    (My personal perception is) I'm confident that an agreement
will be found.
        
    UNDERLYING INFLATION
    While measures of underlying inflation remain generally
muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
    Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up
towards the end of the year and to increase further over the
medium term.
    
    GROWTH RISKS STILL BROADLY BALANCED
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets,
and financial market volatility remain prominent.

    NEAR-TERM GROWTH IMPACT
    Some recent sector-specific developments are having an
impact on the near-term growth profile. 

    READY TO ADJUST ALL INSTRUMENTS 
    The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its
instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to
move towards the... inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    
    PROTECTIONISM, VOLATILITY
    Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in
emerging markets, and financial market volatility remain
prominent. 
    
    SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS
    Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to
support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and
headline inflation developments over the medium term.
    
    UNDERLYING STRENGTH
    ""The underlying strength of the economy continues to support
our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to
our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual
winding down of our net asset purchases.""

    SOMEWHAT WEAKER THAN EXPECTED
    ""Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected,
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion
of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation
pressures.""

President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that he was confident
Italy and the European Commission would resolve their standoff
over Rome's budget plans for 2019.

this week, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending,
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face
disciplinary action. [nL8N1X42NA]
    Draghi said the ECB had not examined the issue at length at
its policy-setting meeting that ended on Thursday as it is not a
monetary policy matter. 
    But he quoted European Commission Vice President Valdis
Dombrovskis, who was also at the ECB meeting, as saying: ""We
have to observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking
a dialogue.""
    Draghi said he personally believed the two sides would
resolve the matter.
    ""I'm confident that an agreement will be found,"" he said.

    Draghi said that while there may be some spillover to other
bond markets from Italy's problems, any impact was limited.
    Sources have told Reuters Italy would need to secure a
bailout from European institutions, which comes with strict
policy conditions, if it was to receive any help from the ECB.

    ITALIAN BANKS
    What can one do as far as banks are concerned given the
widening of the spreads that has taken place in the last five or
six months?
    The first answer to come to mind is reduce the tone and
don't question the constitutional existential framework of the
euro. 
    The second is reduce the spreads so do policies that lead to
a reduction in the spreads.
    
    ON WHETHER REINVESTMENTS WILL BE BASED ON THE CAPITAL KEY

use a different concept other than the capital key.""

Fund (IMF) chief Rodrigo Rato arrived at a Madrid prison on
Thursday to start a four-and-a-half year jail term for using
company credit cards to make costly personal purchases while
running state-owned lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>.
    Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent
figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the
IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state
bailout in 2012.
    Spain's High Court ruled in 2017 that Rato was responsible
for overseeing the misuse of credit cards at the bank, which
involved 64 former Bankia executives, including Rato.
    Corporate credit cards were used to buy jewels, holidays and
expensive clothes, as well as more mundane everyday personal
purchases. In total, prosecutors investigated some 12 million
euros in spending between 2003 and 2012.
    Carrying two suitcases and dressed in jeans, a grey shirt
and a blue sleeveless jacket, Rato thanked family and friends
for their support during the legal process against him before
entering the Soto del Real prison on the outskirts of Madrid.
     ""First of all I would like to say that I fully accept my
obligations before society, I recognise all the mistakes that I 
may have made and I ask for forgiveness from those who may have
felt deceived,"" Rato told reporters gathered outside the jail.
    He appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing, arguing
the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were legal.
    But Spain's Supreme Court confirmed earlier this month the
four-and-half year jail sentence from the High Court and said it
considered the sentence to be proportionate due to Rato's
preeminent position at Bankia.
    The so-called ""black cards"" case sparked widespread anger
when the scandal first broke in 2014, at a time when Spain was
recovering from years of recession, mass layoffs and a banking
crisis partly triggered by Bankia's massive bailout.
    Rato still faces two other legal cases, one over Bankia's
ill-fated public listing in 2011 -- with the trial expected to
begin at the end of November -- and another for tax fraud.

its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course
to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates
sometime after next summer.
    Following are highlights of ECB President Mario Draghi's
comments at a post-policy meeting press conference.
    
    FRAGILE MONETARY UNION
    Our monetary union remains fragile if it is not completed.
And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean the
capital market union, I mean the fiscal capacity design of a
fiscal capacity.
    And all these things are intertwined. Because the better it
is the capital market union, probably the less need we have for
a big fiscal capacity. To make progress on this... I would say
by and large, (we need) the right political contingency. It is
not something that central bankers or Eurocrats can push forward
by themselves. 

    FORWARD GUIDANCE
    (Forward guidance) has served us very well. It has kept
anchored the short-term part of the yield curve while the QE was
actually addressing the long-term part of the yield curve. 
    
    ITALIAN BANKS
    What can one do as far as banks are concerned given the
widening of the spreads that has taken place in the last five or
six months?
    The first answer to come to mind is reduce the tone and
don't question the constitutional existential framework of the
euro. 
    The second is reduce the spreads so do policies that lead to
a reduction in the spreads.
    
    ON WHETHER REINVESTMENTS WILL BE BASED ON THE CAPITAL KEY  
    ""We haven't discussed (but) I'd be surprised if we were to
use a different concept other than the capital key.""  
    
    FUTURE POLICY TOOLS
    We haven't discussed what we are going to do next... We
didn't discuss anything at this meeting, so we are going to
discuss it in the next meeting, where we will also have the
projections, which will also cast some light on what's going to
happen next.
    We do think that we still have tools in our toolbox that we
can use different contingencies. We have not discussed any one
of them today. The TLTRO was raised by two speakers only, but
not in any detail. But this is just an example of how the
toolbox is still quite rich in terms of monetary policy
instruments.
        
    STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT
    The (European) Commission is the ultimate guardian of the
Stability and Growth Pact, not the ECB.
    
    ITALY BONDS
    I don't have a crystal ball... These bonds are in the banks'
portfolios. They are denting in to the capital position of the
banks - that is obvious, that's what it is.  
    I'm still confident an agreement will be found. You have
dent in capital expenditure and then you have weakening funding
conditions as well and all this is going to translate into
different lending terms. 
    
    ITALY BUDGET
    On Italy, you have to remember that Italy is a fiscal
discussion, so there wasn't much discussion about Italy... Vice
President Dombrovskis was there, and I asked him permission to
quote him to what he said. He said of course, 'we have to
observe and apply fiscal rules. But we are also seeking a
dialogue.' 

    (My personal perception is) I'm confident that an agreement
will be found.
        
    UNDERLYING INFLATION
    While measures of underlying inflation remain generally
muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
    Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up
towards the end of the year and to increase further over the
medium term.
    
    GROWTH RISKS STILL BROADLY BALANCED
    The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still
be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets,
and financial market volatility remain prominent.

    NEAR-TERM GROWTH IMPACT
    Some recent sector-specific developments are having an
impact on the near-term growth profile. 

    READY TO ADJUST ALL INSTRUMENTS 
    The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its
instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to
move towards the... inflation aim in a sustained manner.
    
    PROTECTIONISM, VOLATILITY
    Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in
emerging markets, and financial market volatility remain
prominent. 
    
    SIGNIFICANT STIMULUS
    Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to
support the further buildup of domestic price pressures and
headline inflation developments over the medium term.
    
    UNDERLYING STRENGTH
    ""The underlying strength of the economy continues to support
our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to
our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual
winding down of our net asset purchases.""

also subject to the assessment by the Governing Council that the
undertaking of the OMT doesn't prejudge the monetary policy for

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mediobanca <MDBI.MI>
is the outlier of Italy’s banking scene. The Milan-based bank’s
forecast-beating quarterly earnings suggest it has been almost
immune to this year’s sovereign bond market rout. It also has
few bad loans and high liquidity. Hence it can probably grab
market share from rivals that are more exposed to Italy’s
volatile political environment.
    Italy’s best-known investment bank, which has over the past
decade embraced wealth management and consumer banking, on
Thursday reported net profit of 245 million euros, above
consensus. It also has an unchanged common equity Tier 1 capital
ratio of 14.2 percent thanks to its relatively low direct
exposure to Italian government bonds. At 2.8 billion euros,
Mediobanca’s sovereign holdings represent 40 percent of CET1
against 90 percent for Italian rivals on average. This insulates
it from bond gyrations triggered by the spending plans of
Italy’s new populist government.
    A 100 basis point hike in the gap between Italian government
bond rates and their German equivalent lops only about 8 basis
points off Mediobanca’s CET1, the bank says, against the 35 to
40 basis points for peers cited by Fidentiis. A widening of the
spread from 310 basis points currently to 500 – a “danger zone”
that was reached during the 2011 euro zone crisis – would knock
a mere 0.16 percent from Mediobanca’s CET1. That puts it at the
back of the queue in terms of potential Italian bank forced
capital-raisers.
    Mediobanca is also relatively shielded from another
headache: writedowns on sour exposures. Its gross share of dud
loans is 4.5 percent of the total, against an estimated average
of 11 percent for Italian banks. Finally, 10 billion euros of
assets eligible for European Central Bank funding should provide
at least two years of liquidity in a crisis.
    As such a recent 20 percent share slide seems overdone. The
bank is trading at 0.74 times its tangible book value, below the
0.82 times average of large euro zone banks despite its 10
percent return on tangible equity. Investors should be looking
to own the equity, or even buy the bank, if they are inclined to
think positively about Italy’s finances. But there aren’t many
of those right now.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italy’s Mediobanca on Oct. 25 reported a net profit of 245
million euros for the quarter ending in September, higher than a
company-provided consensus of 220 million euros. Net profit was
down 18 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, which
included a capital gain from asset sales.
    - The bank reported a transitional common equity Tier 1
capital ratio (CET1) of 14.2 percent, stable from the end of
June despite rising interest rates in Italian sovereign bonds.
The impact on the ratio from a sharp fall in Italian government
bonds prices in the period was 2 basis points.
    - The bank said its direct exposure to Italian government
bonds was 2.8 billion euros, equal to about 40 percent of its
CET1 ratio.
    - Mediobanca shares have fallen almost 20 percent since a
March 4 general election that brought into power a populist
coalition in Italy. The shares were up 4.5 percent to 7.82 euros
at 1108 GMT on Oct. 25.

 (Rewrites throughout after ECB meeting)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields crept
higher on Thursday but remained near recent lows after European
Central Bank chief Mario Draghi expressed confidence in
underlying euro zone inflation while flagging risks to the
bloc's economy. 
    Acknowledging a weaker recent momentum in the euro zone
economy, Draghi reeled off what he called a ""bunch of
uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism, emerging markets
and financial market volatility. [nL8N1X56JH]
    A brief spike in borrowing costs while Draghi was speaking
quickly reversed, and by the end of the conference they were
flat to marginally higher on the day and within touching
distance of recent lows. 
    ""Draghi did a pretty good job of communicating the ECB is
still on track to remove stimulus but is at the same time
monitoring the risks without panicking or downplaying the
situation,"" said DZ Bank analyst Pascal Segesser. 
    ""He also said if markets and price stability is hurt there
would be measures they could take, tools they could use."" 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the bloc, was 1 basis point higher at 0.40 percent, only a shade
higher than where they were before Draghi started speaking.
<DE10YT=RR> 
    It is not far from a 1 1/2-month low of 0.378 percent hit
earlier in the session.     
    The euro reversed earlier gains and fell on Thursday after
Draghi said the monetary union remained fragile and failed to
assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy.
[L8N1X57UE]
    Rate hike expectations remained steady, with money market
investors pricing in around a 60 percent chance of a rate hike
in September 2019. <ECBWATCH>     
    Draghi also said he is still confident Italy will conclude
an agreement with the European Union on its spending plans, 
after the Commission took the unprecedented step of asking Italy
to resubmit its draft budget. 
    Asked about these comments soon after, Italian Deputy Prime
Minister Matteo Salvini said, ""I also want a deal, but on our
terms."" [nR1N1X4003]
    Italy's 10-year government bond yields, which had dropped 
earlier in the day on improved risk sentiment in global markets
and an upturn in Italian banking stocks, rose three bps through
the conference to 3.50 percent. <IT10YT=RR>     
    It was still down 11 bps on the day and the spread over
Germany was below recent highs at 311 bps. <DE10IT10=RR>  
    ""Draghi acknowledged a weaker momentum and talked about
country specific factors, but mentioned that while there are
also trade uncertainties, growth is turning to potential,"" said
Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.     
    Going into the ECB meeting, this week's euro zone business
surveys showed private-sector growth in the euro zone losing
more momentum than expected, pointing to the slowest quarterly
growth in more than two years. [nL9N1T2014]    
    The five-year five-year forward, a gauge of long-term
inflation expectations in the euro zone, was at its lowest point
since May 29 on Wednesday, standing at 1.667 percent and inching
away from the ECB's target of close to but below 2 percent

    BERLIN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - German tax revenues should
continue to rise over the next five years, Finance Minister Olaf
Scholz said on Thursday, but he warned that growth in the
revenues would slow, restricting room for manoeuvre in the
budget.
    Tax estimates showed federal government tax revenues would
total 321.3 billion euros ($365.48 billion) this year and rise
to 377 billion euros by 2023, Scholz said as he presented
bi-yearly tax estimates.
    Germany's public sector, which includes the federal
government, regional states, municipalities and social funds,
had a record surplus of more than 38 billion euros last year
after the economy grew 2.2 percent.
    In the first six months of this year alone the public sector
surplus was estimated at just above 48 billion euros, raising
the chance of a record surplus this year too.
    But the government has revised down its economic growth
estimates for this year and each of the next two years to 1.8
percent and Scholz warned that this should be mirrored in a less
rosy tax revenues outlook.
    ""We see a stabilisation of the tax revenues and this means
we must prepare ourselves for a normalisation of tax revenues,""
Scholz told a news conference. ""It remains the case that we
don't want new debt and we want to spend the money of our
citizens responsibly.""
    The figures presented by Scholz showed that tax revenues for
the federal government this year would be 2 billion euros higher
than an estimate in May.
    Scholz said the government was exploring slight increases in
spending on foreign aid, defence and research. He declined to
give details about the scale of the spending increases.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
preferred successor as head of Germany's conservatives warned
the Social Democrats (SPD) on Thursday that quitting the ruling
coalition after a weekend regional vote would trigger a federal
election.    
    With the conservatives and SPD facing a second local
election drubbing in two weeks, Sunday's vote in the western
state of Hesse could help decide how Merkel choreographs the end
of her 13-year stewardship of Europe's biggest economy.
    SPD members are piling pressure on their own leaders to
abandon the 'grand coalition' they reluctantly joined in March
and reinvent themselves.
    In unusually blunt language at a campaign event in the city
of Frankfurt, the general-secretary of Merkel's Christian
Democrats (CDU), spelt out what this could mean.
    ""If this government were to break apart now, it would lead
to new elections,"" said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who Merkel
promoted to the senior party post in February in a clear signal
that she is the chancellor's choice to succeed her.
    Opinion polls suggest a snap election would probably hurt
the conservatives and SPD most. 
    Merkel has been weakened by her 2015 decision to let more
than a million migrants into Germany and -- while polls show her
conservatives are still the biggest party -- their support has
fallen to 26-27 percent, meaning a coalition with the SPD might
no longer have sufficient support.
    The environmentalist Greens, on 16-20 percent have overtaken
the SPD in most surveys, and the far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) remain strong with 15-17 percent.
    SPD leader Andrea Nahles, in an interview with the RND
newspaper chain, warned party members against overreacting to
any losses in Hesse, and said it remained to be seen if Merkel's
conservatives and their Bavarian allies could overcome the
differences that have roiled the coalition in recent months.
    Infighting within Merkel's federal coalition, which also
includes Bavaria's CSU, has hit the popularity of all three
partners since they took office in March. The government came to
the brink of collapse in July due to a row over migrant policy.
    After coming second in an election in the southern state of
Bavaria on Oct. 14, the Greens are also set to be kingmakers in
Hesse, but big losses for the conservatives could spell the end
of the conservative-Greens alliance in the state. [nL8N1X33QJ]
    Merkel, in a final campaign speech in Hesse, urged
supporters to go to the polls on Sunday and be ""ambassadors"" for
continued conservative leadership in the state.
    ""Everyone who has the right to vote should do their part,""
she said in the city of Fulda, which borders the former East
Germany. ""You can only vote once every five years. That is when
the future of Hesse will be determined.""
    State premier Volker Bouffier told the rally it was critical
to avoid a leftist alliance taking power.
    ""Either we keep this successful model that we have in Hesse
or there is a leftist alliance,"" he said. ""Those are the
alternatives. Nothing else matters.""

    MADRID, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank <CABK.MC> on
Friday posted a 27.6 percent fall in third-quarter net profit
from a year earlier after it booked a 453 million euro ($515
million) one-off loss due to a stake sale in Spanish oil major
Repsol <REP.MC>.
    Caixabank, Spain's third largest bank, reported net profit
of 470 million euros in the period July to September. 
    Caixabank was under pressure to sell its 9.4 percent stake
in Repsol as it is trying to comply with tougher solvency
requirements and regulators are demanding banks to focus on
their core banking business.
    As end-September, Caixabank's fully-loaded capital ratio,
the strictest measure of solvency, remained at 12.9 percent.
    Taking into account the sale of its Repsol stake and real
estate asset disposals, the fully-loaded capital ratio at
end-September was 11.7 percent.
    Net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus
deposit costs, was 1.24 billion euros in the third quarter, up
3.1 percent from a year ago. NII was slightly below analysts'
forecasts of 1.23 billion euros for the quarter.
    On a quarterly basis, net interest income was up just 0.7
percent on the previous period.
    Like other European lenders, Spanish banks are struggling to
glean earnings from loans with interest rates at historic lows
and as increasing competition erodes margins.

    MADRID, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC>
on Friday announced a 37.4 percent decline in third-quarter net
profit to 127.2 million euros ($144.6 million) after
extraordinary costs of 88 million euros related to an IT outage
at its British unit TSB.
    Analysts had expected a net profit of 123 million euros.
    A botched migration of TSB computer systems in April locked
thousands of users out of their accounts and caused a surge in
attacks by fraudsters, prompting a regulatory investigation and
criticism of its chief executive.
    These costs come on top of an extraordinary charge of 203
million euros for the outage for the second quarter when TSB
experienced a net loss of 16,641 current account customers in
the second quarter of this year, data from Britain's payments
authority Pay.UK showed on Wednesday.
    The extraordinary costs related to the TSB outage included
an increase in interest rates on its premium account, impacted
commissions and fraud losses, the bank said. 
    The bank's handling of the crisis has tarnished its
reputation just as it tried to win more market share in Britain
and offset a squeeze in margins in its Spanish home market as a
result of ultra low interest rates in the euro zone.
    In September, the bank's chief executive Paul Pester
resigned after the botched IT project left thousands of the
bank's customers struggling to access their accounts or make
payments. [nL8N1VQ1N9]

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Costs from an IT outage at its
British bank TSB hit Sabadell's <SABE.MC> third quarter earnings
on Friday, but shares in the Spanish banking group rose as it
exceeded forecasts.
    Sabadell said its its third-quarter net profit had fallen 37
percent after a botched migration of TSB's systems in April
prompted a regulatory investigation and the exit of its CEO.
    The Spanish bank reported net attributable profit for the
quarter of 127 million euros ($145 million), against analyst
forecasts of 123 million euros, lifting its shares by 4.9
percent to 1.0835 euros at 0824 GMT.
    ""Core revenues came in 4 percent above our estimates, with
strong growth across net interest income and fees. This was
driven by a stronger than expected loan growth in Spain,
particularly in the large corporate and retail mortgage
segments,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.
    Spanish rival Caixabank <CABK.MC> reported a decline of 27.6
percent in third-quarter net profit to 470 million euros, after
one-off losses due to a stake sale in Repsol, with its shares
largely flat in early trading. [nL8N1X60U3]
    Sabadell said the extraordinary costs relating to the TSB
outage included an increase in interest rates on its premium
account, impacted commissions and fraud losses. 
    
    NET INTEREST INCOME IMPROVING
    The latest TSB charge of 88 million euros relating to the IT
outage comes on top of an extraordinary charge of 203 million
euros taken by Sabadell in the second quarter.
    Sabadell also said it expected a final net one-off charge of
30 million euros in the fourth quarter, taking the total costs
related to the TSB IT migration to 321 million euros.
    The bank's handling of the crisis tarnished its reputation
just as it tried to win more market share in Britain and offset
a squeeze in margins in its Spanish home market as a result of
ultra low interest rates in the euro zone.[nL8N1VQ1N9]
    In the latest quarter, Sabadell's net interest income, a
measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 932.6
million, down 0.9 percent from a year ago due to pressure from
low interest rates. However, this was up 3.8 percent against the
previous quarter on lower funding costs.
    Sabadell continued to reduce its non-performing assets by
538 million euros in the quarter at a time when the European
Central Bank is urging lenders to remove these toxic assets from
their balance sheets.

2349,5763,3527e2ffb885bc70eec3f22a5ff0004f,UPDATE 1-Euro zone inflation expectations unchanged despite growth slowdown: ECB survey,2018-10-26 16:48:44,EUR,0,2018-10-26 16:48:53,{'EUR': 'Positive'}," (Adds detail)
    FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Euro zone prices are expected
to continue growing at 1.7 percent per year until 2020 despite
weaker underlying inflation and economic growth, a European
Central Bank survey showed on Friday.
    The ECB confirmed a day earlier plans to wind down its 2.6
trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) stimulus programme at the end of
this year and raise interest rates sometime after next summer
because it still sees inflation holding up despite uncertainties
around growth.
    Its latest Survey of Professional Forecasters on Friday
backed up that line of thought, with unchanged expectations for
headline inflation for this year and the next two, at 1.7
percent, and in the longer term at 1.9 percent.
    But the forecasters polled by the ECB cut their estimates
for core inflation, which strips out the more volatile energy
and food prices, and economic growth for this year and the next.
    ""Respondents typically attributed their revisions to
external factors such as higher energy prices weighing on
disposable income, with many also noting ... some dampening
impact on exports and investment due to increased uncertainty
surrounding the outlook for world trade,"" the ECB said.
    The euro zone's central bank targets a headline inflation
rate ""below, but close to 2 percent"" over the medium term.
    In its survey, the ECB also noted that growth in core prices
was still accelerating, albeit now 10 basis points more slowly
at 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent the next.
    ""The expected pick-up in underlying inflation remained
underpinned by a pick-up in annual growth in compensation per
employee, which was expected to increase to 2.3 percent by
2020,"" the central bank said.

    By Padraic Halpin
    DUBLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Allied Irish Banks <AIBG.I> chief
executive Bernard Byrne is joining an exodus which Ireland's
second-biggest lender has blamed on a pay cap and growing demand
for bankers as international financial firms move to Dublin due
to Brexit.
    AIB said on Friday Byrne would depart next year, leaving it
looking for a new CEO as well as a chief financial officer after
Mark Bourke said last month he was quitting. [nL5N1VR421] 
    It will also revive the debate on the ban on bonuses and a
cap on pay introduced during Ireland's banking crisis a decade
ago.
    AIB chairman Richard Pym said last week this had turned the
state-controlled bank, whose shares fell 6.3 percent to 3.92
euros at 0910 GMT, into a ""training ground"" for competitors.
    ""It was a very grim day in my life when Bernard told me that
he had an external opportunity which he wanted to pursue. The
fact that it came so soon after the resignation of our CFO, Mark
Bourke, made it doubly difficult,"" Pym said in a statement.
    AIB raised the prospect over a year ago that it could
potentially lose staff to international banks that are moving
operations to Dublin as a result of Brexit, and do not fall
under the Irish pay restrictions.
    Byrne, who declined to comment on his plans, told the Irish
Times last week that of AIB's 200 most senior managers, a
""mid-teens"" percentage had left since its 3.4 billion euro ($3.9
billion) listing last year, a slightly higher attrition rate
than normal that he said was accelerating. [nL8N1WX78B]  
    
    EASY TO LEAVE 
    Byrne also said last week that without pay, pension or share
incentives ""it's very easy to leave"" and that this was causing a
bit of a drag in terms of investor interest in AIB.
    The bank's shares are well below the 4.40 euro listing price
achieved at Europe's largest initial public offering of 2017 and
more than 30 percent down on a high hit early in 2018.
    Although AIB sought to introduce a deferred share plan for
senior executives earlier this year, it was voted down by the
government, which retains a 71 percent shareholding.[nL8N1RW5TK]
    While Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe acknowledged
the restrictions could act as a barrier to the retention of some
staff and launched a review, he said the policy was appropriate.
    Any policy change is complicated by the fact that Donohoe is
part of a minority government that has just begun talks over
whether to renew a cooperation deal or go to the polls. 
    Donohoe thanked Byrne in a statement, saying he would leave
AIB in a much stronger financial position as outlined in a
trading update in which the bank said it was on track to deliver
on full-year expectations. [nFWN1X51KM]

    MILAN, Oct 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The BlackRock of
Europe is sticking by a 7 pct adjusted net income target through
2020. That’s higher than what it managed in the third quarter.
But a faster rise in net inflows despite choppy market
conditions is better than the outflows seen by rivals.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Milan/London-October 26: Fitch Ratings has placed Bank of Cyprus 
Public Company Limited's (BoC, B-/Positive/B) conditional pass-through (CPT) 
mortgage covered bonds - rated 'BBB+' - on Rating Watch Positive (RWP).

The rating action follows the upgradeof Cyprus's Country Ceiling to 'A' 
following the upgrade of the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' (see ""Fitch 
Upgrades Cyprus to 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable"" dated 19 October 2018 at 
www.fitchratings.com). As a consequence, Fitch will review and set the asset and 
cash flow assumptions for the analysis of Cypriot residential mortgage loans up 
to the revised Country Ceiling.

Fitch expects to resolve the RWP within six months.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The 'BBB+' rating on the mortgage covered bonds is based on BoC's IDR of 'B-', 
an IDR uplift of two notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of eight 
notches, a recovery uplift of three notches and the 47% overcollateralisation 
(OC) committed by the issuer. This provides more protection than the programme's 
unchanged 'BBB+' 44.5% breakeven OC. All uplift factors remain unchanged.

The 47% relied-upon OC is sufficient to support timely payments at the 'BB+' 
tested rating on a probability of default (PD) basis and offsets a 'BBB+' credit 
loss, corresponding to a three-notch recovery uplift above the tested rating on 
a PD basis. The breakeven OC components are unchanged as follows: a credit loss 
component of 14.3% and an ALM loss of 30.3%, which represents the cost of 
bridging interest rate mismatches and incorporates the cash flow effect of 
pass-through redemption.

The two-notch IDR uplift reflects the covered bonds exemption from bail-in and 
the low risk of under-collateralisation in a resolution scenario. The latter is 
based on Fitch's assessment of the strength of the Cypriot covered bond legal, 
supervisory and regulatory framework. The IDR uplift also takes into account 
that BoCs Long-Term IDR is driven by the bank's Viability Rating. The PCU 
reflects the CPT feature as well as the principal coverage and six-month 
interest provision required by law. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The rating of the covered bonds would be upgraded, provided sufficient 
protection is available to withstand stresses associated to rating scenarios 
above 'BBB+' and up to the revised Country Ceiling for Cyprus.

The Fitch breakeven OC for the covered bond rating will be affected, among 
others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered 
bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. 
Therefore the breakeven OC to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed 
to remain stable over time.

will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the 
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is 
offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of 
relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its 
advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as 
audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, 
the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources 
with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the 
issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports 
should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any 
third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on 
in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. 
Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the 
information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and 
other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial 
statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings 
and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking 
and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature 
cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current 
facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that 
were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. 

The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or 
warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or 
any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the 
report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. 
This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and 
methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, 
ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, 
or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The 
rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or 
sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals 
identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible 
for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes 
only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute 
for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer 
and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be 
changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the 
adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular 
investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to 
any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other 
obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from 
US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In 
certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular 
issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 
(or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or 
dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to 
use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed 
under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act 
of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular 
jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and 
distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to 
three days earlier than to print subscribers. 

For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd 
holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which 
authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit 
ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to be used by persons who 
are retail clients within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001

Fitch Ratings, Inc. is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the 
""NRSRO""). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on 
Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on 
behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory), other 
credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the ""non-NRSROs"") and 
therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf 
of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit 
ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amundi <AMUN.PA> 
warrants the benefit of the doubt. Europe’s largest asset
manager is sticking to a plan to grow adjusted net income by 7
percent a year. That’s higher than the rate of growth seen in
the third quarter. But continuous rise in net inflows despite
choppy market conditions should give some comfort.
    The ‘BlackRock of Europe’ reported adjusted net income of
230 million euros in the quarter, up 5.8 percent from a year
earlier. Investors got disappointed by lower than expected net
income and performance fees, sending shares down more than 5
percent.
    But look beyond the quarterly data, and the trend in inflows
is surprisingly solid if compared with the depressed
performances of other international asset managers. Amundi
managed to add 6.1 billion euros of net inflows in the third
quarter, higher than the 2.6 billion euros of the previous one
and with an unbroken progression since it took on Pioneer
Investments from Italy’s UniCredit <CRDI.MI>  in 2017. Retail
inflows have been particularly strong since the start of the
year, in Italy as well as elsewhere, helping the group grow its
assets under management base to 1.48 trillion euros.
    Others are doing worse. Bigger rival BlackRock <BLK.N> 
reported net outflows for the third quarter, and so did Jupiter
<JUP.L>, Morgan Stanley <MS.N>  and DWS <DWSG.DE>. With an
annualised growth rate of 4.5 percent this year, Amundi may be
on track to register the best net inflow growth performance
among large global asset managers.
    Sure, there are clouds in the sky. A global trade war,
Brexit and Italy’s stand-off with European Union institutions
risk prolonging market jitters and making clients wary to commit
more funds to Amundi to manage. But the European asset manager
is at least starting on a more solid base.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - France’s Amundi, Europe’s biggest asset manager, confirmed
it expects 2018 adjusted net profit to rise 7 percent a year
until 2020 to 1.05 billion euros, after third-quarter profits
were boosted by additional client money going into its main
funds. 
    - Amundi, majority owned by Credit Agricole, reported
adjusted net profit of 230 million euros, up 5.8 percent
year-on-year. 
    - Amundi held nearly 1.5 trillion euros in assets under
management as of September 30. 
Amundi bought Pioneer Investments from Italy’s largest bank by
assets UniCredit for 3.5 billion euros in a deal finalised in
2017. 
    - Shares were down 6 percent to 51.4 euros at 0910 GMT on
Oct. 26.

    HELSINKI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Finnish consumer confidence
fell to a two-year low in October, data published on Monday
showed, in a sign that a period of strong economic growth was
coming to an end. 
    Consumer confidence fell to 16.8 points in October from 20.2
points in September, compared to a long-term average of 12.6,
Statistics Finland said.
    Industry confidence declined to 9 points from 10 points in
September. This was its lowest since August 2017 but still well
above the indicator's long-term average of 1 point, the
Confederation of Finnish Industries said in a separate
statement.
    ""The strongest growth in the Finnish economy is now behind
and from now on the course will be more moderate,"" Juhana
Brotherus, chief economist at Hypo Bank said in a statement. 
    ""The decline in household confidence combined with falling
shares and political instability raises concerns,"" Brotherus
wrote, referring to an ongoing dispute over employee rights
between Finland's government and the country's powerful labour
unions. [nL8N1WX3XJ]
    Latest forecasts for Finland's GDP growth vary from 2.5 to
3.0 percent for 2018 and from 1.8 to 2.4 percent for 2019.

    ""Stocks in Europe are expected to open around half a percentage point higher at the start of
the week providing some early relief, although as we’ve seen in the past in such environments,
this can very quickly change"", wrote Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. 
    It also looks unlikely that the UK budget, even with a promise to end austerity, or Merkel's
latest electoral defeat, will boost risk taking across European markets.

worst monthly performance since August 2015, opened in positive
territory on Monday in a tentative rebound from a sell-off which
has pushed them to a level not seen since December 2016.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Concern over China’s slowing
economy dented U.S. stock futures and kept world stocks under
pressure on Monday although European shares climbed thanks to
encouraging earnings reports and relief that Italy dodged a
ratings downgrade.
    The euro, however, fell to a session low after a senior
party source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek
re-election as party chairwoman after bruising losses for her
Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse.
[nS8N1WD01U]
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> was up 0.7 percent by 0929 GMT while
the leading index of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> rose 0.5
percent, boosted by a weaker euro. 
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> led the market with a 1.5 percent
gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low
following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign
rating unchanged, sparking relief there was no ratings
downgrade. [nL8N1X9150]
    This also boosted Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> up 2.7
percent.
    Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting
the farm on a turnaround in risk. 
    ""The only way I can summarize the core sentiment among the
European investors I met is something like 'pretty grim',"" wrote
Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, in a note to
clients.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tracking shares
in 47 countries, managed a 0.1 percent gain. The index is down
9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7 trillion in
market capitalisation since its January peak.
    Overnight losses in Asia were largely led by China’s
blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent.
    Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as
profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth
consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw
materials and manufactured goods. [nL3N1X700R]
    S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial futures declined 0.2 to 0.3
percent after the figures, reversing gains of as much as 0.4
percent earlier. <1YMc1> <ESc1> 
    Global financial markets have been hit by a range of
negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict
to tensions in Europe over Italy's budget and tightening
monetary policy.
    Many indices are already in official correction territory
amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global
growth.
    Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European
earnings at the fastest pace since Feb 2016, and weak results
from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S. stocks at the
end of last week.
    
    BOLSONARO WIN BOOST EMERGING STOCKS
    Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were a bright spot,
gaining 0.1 percent in their first rise in five sessions after
far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the second-round runoff
in Brazil's presidential election.
    Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed as investors cheered
the win. Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust <BRLA.L>
London-listed shares gained 7.4 percent while a Germany-listed
iShares MSCI Brazil ETF <.MBRABRL.DE> climbed 6.6 percent.
    ""Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is
that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing
the country's competitiveness,"" said UBS analysts. 
    In FX, the dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.2 percent to 96.553
after gaining 0.7 percent last week.
    The euro <EUR=> fell 0.2 percent to near a two-month low at
$1.1381. Sterling <GBP=> fell 0.2 percent, holding near a
two-month trough of $1.2775 ahead of Britain’s annual budget due
later on Monday. 
    Finance minister Philip Hammond will likely urge his divided
Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push for a
Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity.
    In commodities, oil also reversed early gains to dip on
growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude <CLc1> fell 58
cents to $67.01 per barrel and Brent crude <LCOc1> slid 71 cents
to $76.89.
    Spot gold prices <XAU=> edged lower as the dollar firmed.

step of a long-running effort to build the world's largest
toll-road group.
    The announcement comes few days after the death of Gilberto
Benetton, a prominent member of the Italian family that controls
Atlantia and a strong supporter of the acquisition. 
    It also follows the collapse in August of a motorway bridge
operated by Atlantia's unit Autostrade per l'Italia, a disaster
that exposed Atlantia to harsh criticism by the Italian
government and risked jeopardising the deal.  
    The Italian infrastructure group said in a statement it had
indirectly acquired 50 percent plus one share of Abertis.
    Spanish builder ACS takes a stake of 30 percent in the
Spanish motorway group, with ACS's German unit Hochtief
<HOTG.DE> holding 20 percent less one share in it.
    Under the same deal, Atlantia has also bought 23.9 percent
of Hochtief at a price of 143.04 euros per share, for a total
consideration of 2.4 billion euros.
    Shares in Atlantia were up more than 2.3 percent after the
announcement, in line with a similar rise in Italy's bluechip
index <.FTMIB>.
    
    LONG-RUNNING BATTLE
    Atlantia announced its intention to buy Abertis in May 2017
but a competing bid by ACS emerged some months later, locking
the two companies in a bid war.
    An agreement sealed last March between Italy's Benetton
family and Real Madrid soccer club Chairman Florentino Perez,
who heads ACS, created the basis for a joint bid.
    The shares in Abertis will be held via investment vehicles
Abertis HoldCo and Abertis Partecipaciones.
    The 16.5 billion euros jointly invested in the transaction
includes an equity injection of 6.9 billion euros in Abertis
HoldCo. 
    The financing package for the deal includes a 3 billion euro
amortising term loan, a 4.7 billion euro bridge-to-bond facility
and a 2.2 billion bridge-to-disposal facility. 
    Lazard <LAZ.N> and JP Morgan advised ACS and Hochtief on the
deal while Credit Suisse, Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> and Santander
<SAN.MC> worked for Atlantia.

    NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - NXMH, a Belgium-based
investment company, has acquired digital currency exchange
Bitstamp in an all cash deal, the exchange's chief executive
officer Nejc Kodrič said on Monday.
    Kodrič declined to disclose terms of the deal, which was
signed on Oct. 25. In 2016, Bitstamp was valued at $60 million,
up from a 2014 valuation of $39 million, according to Kodrič.
    Bitstamp is the largest digital currency exchange in the
European Union by volume, with turnover of $100 million per day.
 
    NXMH, with assets under management of more than 2 billion
euros, is the European subsidiary of South Korea-based NXC,
which invests in digital technologies. NXC also owns South
Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit. 
    Bitstamp and Korbit will operate independently.
    ""The sale wasn't planned. There was no active effort to go
around and solicit buyers,"" Kodrič told Reuters in an interview.
    ""The vibrant industry last year sparked potential interest
from buyers to make a footprint in the industry. We started to
get approached by buyers in the middle of last year,"" he added.
    Bitstamp had four interested buyers, the exchange's CEO
said, but opted to go with NXMH because it will allow the
Luxembourg exchange to operate as it is.
    Through the purchase, NXMH acquires an 80 percent stake in
Bitstamp. Kodrič retains a 10 percent ownership interest in the
exchange and will continue as CEO. 
    Pantera Capital Management LP, which made a $10 million
investment in the company in 2014, also sold part of its stake
in Bitstamp to NXMH.
    Kodrič and Damian Merlak founded the company in 2011. It has
grown to more than 3 million registered customers today.
    Merlak sold his entire 30 percent stake in Bitstamp with the
deal and has not been active since 2015, Kodrič said.
    Like all exchanges, Bitstamp has been affected by the
current decline in cryptocurrency prices. Kodrič said volume has
been down between 60-70 percent, but pointed out that Bitstamp
remained profitable in 2018 because current cryptocurrency
prices were still much higher than they were for most of last
year. 
    Kodrič and Merlak founded Bitstamp in August 2011 and the
company was first based out of a Slovenia garage with just a
server, a couple of laptops, and a thousand euros in capital.

    By Julien Ponthus
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European shares, set for their
worst monthly performance since August 2015, opened in positive
territory on Monday in a tentative rebound from a sell-off which
has depressed them to a level not seen since December 2016.
    At 0957 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was up 1
percent with most bourses firmly in the black with U.S. stock
futures turning positive despite worries about China's slowing
economy previously weighing on Asian shares.
    ""European markets enjoyed a stronger start to the week,
despite a sell-off in China as investors digested the impact of
a trade war with the US on industrial earnings"", said Russ
Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
    The banking sector <.SX7P> was the best-performing one, up
1.8 percent with HSBC <HSBA.L> rising 4.5 percent after Europe's
biggest bank by assets posted a higher-than-expected 28 percent
rise in third-quarter profit. [nL3N1X91W1]    
    On the other hand, Spain's state-controlled Bankia <BKIA.MC>
was down 4.7 percent after posting lower than expected Q3
results. 
    Italian banks shone after rating agency S&P kept its credit
rating two notches above non-investment grade for Italian
sovereign bonds. 
    Banco BPM <.BAMI.MI> shares rose 3.3 pecent, Ubi Banca
<UBI.MI> 3 pecent and Unicredit <CRDI.MI> 2.5 percent.
    Milan's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> posted the best regional rise, up
1.2 percent while London's FTSE rose 0.9 percent with investors
waiting to learn more about Britain's 2019 budget and what
impact it might have on individual companies.
    Frankfurt's <GDAXI> accelerated its gains to 1.3 percent 
after a senior party source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel
would not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference
in early December. 
    The open of Paris CAC 40 <.FCHI> resumed after being delayed
due to technical issues and was up 0.3 percent.   
    Another strong performing sector was healthcare <.SXDP>, up
1.7 percent with Novartis <NOVN.S> adding 1.9 percent. 
    The Swiss group and Pfizer Inc PFE.N are teaming up to
develop treatments for a liver disease many drug companies
believe will become a hugely lucrative market, as it is tied to
the obesity and diabetes epidemics.

    * Prices and climate are part of the appeal 
    * ""Golden visa"" scheme also attracts investors

    By Angeliki Koutantou
    ATHENS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Three times a week, hundreds of
Chinese investors arrive at Athens airport to be greeted by
Greek real estate agents who drive them straight into the city
to view apartments for sale.
    The visitors are drawn to Greece by rock-bottom property
prices and one of Europe's most generous ""golden visa"" schemes,
offering a renewable five-year resident's permit in return for a
250,000 euro ($285,000)investment in real estate.
    That's enough to buy a three-bedroom apartment in the
capital with a view to the Acropolis hill.
    It is also enough to bring the first glimmers of recovery to
the market since the Greek economy started to collapse after the
debt crisis in 2009, although prices are still down by about 40
percent from their peak.
    One Athens resident, who gave his name only as Vassilis, had
almost given up finding a buyer for his home last year when a
minivan pulled up outside his maisonette and a Chinese family of
four got out. A day later, he got an offer.  
    ""They didn’t see the house again. We went and got a
down-payment, and everything was set in motion,"" he said.
    Vassilis had bought the home in the up-and-coming suburb of
Gerakas for 320,000 euros ($367,000) in 2007 and decided to sell
in order to buy his two adult children their own apartments. He
sold it to the Chinese family for 220,000 euros.
    Real estate prices rose 0.8 percent in the second quarter
year-on-year after a 0.1 percent rise in the first – the first
pick-up since 2008, according to Bank of Greece data.
    Foreign direct investment in property jumped 91 percent to
287 million euros last year from 2016, the bank's data showed.
Meanwhile, taxes from property sales rose by an annual 41
percent in the seven months to July to 204.7 million euros,
according to data from state revenue authority AADE. 
    ""We are getting much more phone calls,"" said Lefteris
Potamianos, head of the Real Estate Association of Athens, which
 represents about 3,000 brokers.
    ""The overwhelming majority is foreigners and there are yet
some Greeks. Certainly, Chinese are by far ahead of the game.""
    Potamianos predicted house prices would rise an average 5-7
percent annually in the greater Athens area this year and the
next.

    THE FLIP SIDE
    It helps that the yuan has fallen more than 6 percent
against the dollar this year. Beijing restricts overseas
investment but Chinese investors are still finding ways to get
money out of the country.    
    People like Lian Wenmin, 29, a former accountant from
Beijing and potential golden-visa investor, say buying in Greece
is not just about taking advantage of low prices and getting a
visa that allows them to travel freely within the European
Union.
    Greece's warm climate is also part of the appeal, Lian says.
    ""Greece has very nice weather and I like the people, the
food,"" she told Reuters on the balcony of an apartment she is
thinking of buying in an upmarket area overlooking central
Athens.
    Lian plans to spend 250,000 euros on one or two apartments
in central Athens to rent out on a home-sharing site such as
Airbnb, and possibly on another property for herself in a
southern suburb.
    ""I can buy like two or three apartments with 250,000 but if
I spend the same amount of money in Beijing I can only buy one
apartment in a generally nice location of 30 square meters. It's
big difference,"" she said.
    Tighter restrictions on migration starting last year in the
United States, Canada and Australia - popular destinations for
Chinese in the past - have also worked in Greece's favour, said
Alice Ma, sales manager at Beijing-based Bloom Consulting.
    Portugal's five-year golden-visa programme has also
attracted Chinese interest along with investors from France and
Britain, but there buyers need to put in at least 500,000 euros.
 [nL8N1WC2NZ] [nL8N1WZ4GT]
    Ioannis Anastassiadis's Anastassiadis Group offers a wide
range of services to facilitate Chinese investment, including
providing lawyers and notaries to help secure the visa.
    ""Greece is slowly becoming a place which attracts people to
live here and to plan even the rest of their lives in Greece,""
he said. 
    For renters, the Chinese-led interest is not good news,
however.
    The buy-to-rent mentality of many of the buyers is pushing
up rents and sometimes leading to threats of eviction unless
renters agree to pay the higher prices, said Angelos Skiadas,
head of Greece's tenants association PASYPE.
    Rents across Greece rose by 8.4 percent in the 12 months to
September from a year earlier, according to a survey by the
Greek franchise of RE/MAX International.
    ""Since last year, the problem is becoming a nightmare,""
Skiadas said. ""Τenants are forced to leave because they are
being blackmailed by their landlords, while those who look for a
new house are faced with extravagant rents.""
    He said PASYPE plans to lobby the government to raise the
minimum rental period from three to six years.    
    Of the 3,404 residency permits issued since the golden visa
programme started in 2013, almost 1,700 have gone to Chinese
nationals, data from investment agency Enterprise Greece showed.
    Carrie Law, chief executive of Juwai.com, a Chinese website
for global real estate, said inquiries about Greece doubled in
the first quarter of 2018 and jumped three-fold in the second.
    ""It is a dramatic growth,"" she said.

    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Germany’s
chancellor has called time on her own tenure by deciding to not
seek re-election as chairwoman of her party, the Christian
Democrats. They could shift rightwards after her departure and
adopt a tougher line on those, like Italy, who flout Europe’s
budget rules.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her
Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as
party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior
party source said on Oct. 29.
    - Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up
the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as
chancellor.
    - The Christian Democrats were first in an election held on
Oct. 28 in the western state of Hesse but support for the party
fell by more than 11 points. The centre-left Social Democrats
(SPD), who are Merkel’s junior coalition partner, won about a
fifth of the vote, their worst result in the western state since
1946.

    MILAN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Italian regional lender BPER
<EMII.MI> is one of the possible partners for a tie-up with
Unipol Banca, the CEO of Unipol group <UNPI.MI> Carlo Cimbri
told daily la Repubblica on Monday.
    Financial group Unipol is already a shareholder in BPER with
a stake of 15 percent. 
    Cimbri, however, ruled out his group would ""fully
consolidate' BPER if it were to merge with Unipol Banca. 
    ""Our role will remain that of an important shareholder, but
nothing more,"" Cimbri told la Repubblica.
    BPER declined to comment on the report.
    Unipol, which also owns the country's second-largest insurer
UnipolSai <US.MI>, has been increasing its stake in BPER and has
been authorised by the European Central Bank to buy up to 20
percent of the regional bank. 
    Last summer, Unipol increased by about 5 percent its share
in BPER, with the aim of boosting the growth prospects of the
lender, with which it already has a bancassurance partnership
agreement. 
    But in August Cimbri said he did not intend to go above the
20 percent threshold.
    Last year, Unipol shifted 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of
bad loans at Unipol Banca to a special vehicle to get the
banking unit ready to take part in the expected consolidation of
Italy's banking system.
    BPER is expected to present a new business plan later this
year. According to daily Il Sole 24 Ore, the strategy will be
presented in November, potentially announcing a tie-up with
Unipol Banca.

    LATE MORNING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SEES BROAD BOUNCE (1123 GMT)
    The bounce we're seeing in Europe today is pretty broad with all country benchmarks and most
sectoral indexes trading firmly in the black. Relief over S&P's rating decision on Italy
[nL8N1X67LT], some good news from China for the auto sector [nL8N1X92LH] and strong results from
HSBC are lifting the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> up 1.3 percent, helping the market off earlier weakness
in Asia. 
    As you can see, Italy <.FTMIB> was the standout gainer, up 2.7 percent, while the German DAX
<.GDAXI> is also up a solid 2 percent as the rally in autos overshadows possible political risk
the euro zone's largest economy. [nS8N1WD01U]      
 
    Extra tidbit: five out of six stocks on the STOXX 600 were in positive territory.
    (Danilo Masoni)
    *****
        
    ON THE RADAR: HSBC IN THE SPOTLIGHT (0756 GMT) 
    Futures are indicating an open in positive territory even if there isn’t that much to cheer
up markets this morning between slower growth in China, another electoral blow for Merkel in
Hesse or the UK budget with an elusive promise to end austerity in Brexit-Britain.
    Today’s batch of macro indicators and Q3 earnings is also quite limited and it's definitely 
HSBC which is stealing the spotlight after beating forecasts for Q3. [nL3N1X54K0] 
    Still in the sector, Spain's Bankia Q3 net profit rose 1.7 pct and Deutsche Bank pulled the
sale of its Mexico unit to a local bank. [nL8N1X818B] 
    A few headlines in the pharmaceutical sector with Novartis, Pfizer joining forces on
potentially lucrative fatty liver disease, [nL8N1X66HA] and Takeda proposing to sell a drug to
win regulatory approval for Shire. [nL3N1X92S9]
    Kering announced it would buy back 1 percent of its shares and Daimler said it could
cooperate with Tesla in the future. 
    Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said it was planning to file
resolutions at Ryanair’s next AGM to replace Chairman David Bonderman. [nL8N1X80NQ]

    ***** 
    
    
    EUROPEAN FUTURES OPEN HIGHER (0713 GMT) 
    European futures have opened unequivocally in positive territory despite weakness in Asia,
particularly in China, and U.S futures trading in the red. 
    Indications from spreadbetters seeing a positive open in Europe are proving to be accurate: 
 
 
 
    (Julien Ponthus) 
    *****
       

    NOT MUCH OF A REBOUND IN SIGHT (0649 GMT) 
    The fact that S&P and Dow futures are in negative territory isn't doing much to beef up
morale and the same can be said about the end of the trading session in Asia.
    MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up just 0.13 percent and Chinese shares
took a hit as more evidence got about the economy slowing down. 
    There's really nothing much out there to substantiate hopes in a rebound just right now. 
    ""Stocks in Europe are expected to open around half a percentage point higher at the start of
the week providing some early relief, although as we’ve seen in the past in such environments,
this can very quickly change"", wrote Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. 
    It also looks unlikely that the UK budget, even with a promise to end austerity, or Merkel's
latest electoral defeat, will boost risk taking across European markets.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European shares climbed and U.S.
stock futures erased losses on Monday thanks to encouraging
earnings reports, while the euro fell briefly after sources said
German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election as
head of her CDU party.
    Her decision, which followed bruising losses for her
Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse, heralded
the eventual end of an era in which she has dominated European
politics. [nL8N1X926U]
    Senior party sources said Merkel wants to serve her full
term as chancellor until 2021, comment which eased investors'
nerves and subsequently drove the euro back into positive
territory. [nL8N1X92EG]
    Europe's autos sector <.SXAP> surged 4.7 percent, set for
its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China
was considering halving the tax on car purchases in an attempt
to boost demand for autos which has been hurt by a trade war and
slowing economic growth. [nL8N1X92LH] [nL3N1X940G]
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> jumped 2.1 percent by 1128 GMT,
boosted by BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, while the leading index
of euro zone stocks <.STOXX50E> rose 1.5 percent. 
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> led the market with a 2.8 percent
gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low
following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign
rating unchanged, prompting relief there was no ratings
downgrade. [nL8N1X92J0]
    This also pushed Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> up 4.5
percent, set for their strongest day since Sept. 10.
    Strong gains across Europe helped boost U.S. stock futures
back into the positive, with the Nasdaq futures <NQc1> up 1.4
percent, S&P 500 futures <ESc1> up 1.1 percent and Dow Jones
futures <1YMc1> up 0.7 percent.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tracking shares
in 47 countries, extended early gains to rise 0.4 percent. The
index is down 9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7
trillion in market capitalisation since its January peak.
    Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting
on a turnaround in risk. ""The only way I can summarize the core
sentiment among the European investors I met is something like
'pretty grim',"" wrote Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at
UniCredit, in a note to clients.
    Overnight Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s
blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent.
    Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as
profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth
consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw
materials and manufactured goods. [nL3N1X700R]
    Global financial markets have been hit by a range of
negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict
to tensions in Europe over Italy's budget and tightening
monetary policy.
    Many indices are already in official correction territory
amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global
growth.
    ""With the volatility of the last week or so, today’s
stronger open to markets should not be seen as a sea change but
more a pause for breath,"" said Edward Park, investment director
at Brooks Macdonald. 
    Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European
earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak
results from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S.
stocks at the end of last week.
    
    BOLSONARO WIN BOOSTS EMERGING STOCKS
    Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> climbed 0.4 percent in
their first rise in five sessions after far-right candidate Jair
Bolsonaro won the runoff in Brazil's presidential election.
    Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed as investors cheered
the win. Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust <BRLA.L>
London-listed shares gained 8.4 percent while a Germany-listed
iShares MSCI Brazil ETF <MBRABRL.DE> climbed 5.8 percent.
    ""Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is
that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing
the country's competitiveness,"" said UBS analysts. 
    Foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued with the
dollar index holding flat. 
    The euro <EUR=> recovered after its fall on the Merkel news,
and was last up 0.1 percent at $1.1407. Sterling <GBP=> held
flat and near a two-month trough of $1.2775 before Britain’s
annual budget due later on Monday. 
    Finance minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his
divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push
for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of
austerity.
    In commodities, oil prices dipped as investors priced in
growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude <CLc1> pared
early losses to fall 28 cents to $67.30 per barrel and Brent
crude <LCOc1> slid 29 cents to $77.33.

    NO 'MERKEXIT' RALLY ON THE DAX (1230 GMT)
    News that Merkel will not be seeking re-election as CDU party chairwoman has coincided with
Germany's DAX set for its biggest jump since April. Is that the effect of 'Merkexit' on
investors?
    Likely not. 
    Berenberg's economist Holger Schmieding just told us that the German chancellor's
announcement she will step down after her term ends in 2021 ""adds an extra layer of uncertainty""
to the political future of the euro zone's powerhouse and certainly can't be seen as a positive
right now.
    On the contrary, chances are that decision-making will be put on hold in the short-term and
one can't really see what pro-business policies the departure of ""Mutti"" (Merkel's 'mom'
nickname) could accelerate, if any, he said. 
    Schmieding's analysis is therefore more in line with the euro falling briefly and German
government bond yields edging up.
    As for the DAX, there is little doubt that the surge in European car stocks following
Bloomberg's report on China planning to cut car purchase tax, is the main reason for its rise.
    Volkswagen is up 5.8 percent, Daimler 5 percent and BMW 3.9 percent.

    LATE MORNING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SEES BROAD BOUNCE (1123 GMT)
    The bounce we're seeing in Europe today is pretty broad with all country benchmarks and most
sectoral indexes trading firmly in the black. Relief over S&P's rating decision on Italy
[nL8N1X67LT], some good news from China for the auto sector [nL8N1X92LH] and strong results from
HSBC are lifting the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> up 1.3 percent, helping the market off earlier weakness
in Asia. 
    As you can see, Italy <.FTMIB> was the standout gainer, up 2.7 percent, while the German DAX
<.GDAXI> is also up a solid 2 percent as the rally in autos overshadows possible political risk
the euro zone's largest economy. [nS8N1WD01U]      
 
    Extra tidbit: five out of six stocks on the STOXX 600 were in positive territory.

    ON THE RADAR: HSBC IN THE SPOTLIGHT (0756 GMT) 
    Futures are indicating an open in positive territory even if there isn’t that much to cheer
up markets this morning between slower growth in China, another electoral blow for Merkel in
Hesse or the UK budget with an elusive promise to end austerity in Brexit-Britain.
    Today’s batch of macro indicators and Q3 earnings is also quite limited and it's definitely 
HSBC which is stealing the spotlight after beating forecasts for Q3. [nL3N1X54K0] 
    Still in the sector, Spain's Bankia Q3 net profit rose 1.7 pct and Deutsche Bank pulled the
sale of its Mexico unit to a local bank. [nL8N1X818B] 
    A few headlines in the pharmaceutical sector with Novartis, Pfizer joining forces on
potentially lucrative fatty liver disease, [nL8N1X66HA] and Takeda proposing to sell a drug to
win regulatory approval for Shire. [nL3N1X92S9]
    Kering announced it would buy back 1 percent of its shares and Daimler said it could
cooperate with Tesla in the future. 
    Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said it was planning to file
resolutions at Ryanair’s next AGM to replace Chairman David Bonderman. [nL8N1X80NQ]

    EUROPEAN FUTURES OPEN HIGHER (0713 GMT) 
    European futures have opened unequivocally in positive territory despite weakness in Asia,
particularly in China, and U.S futures trading in the red. 
    Indications from spreadbetters seeing a positive open in Europe are proving to be accurate: 
 
 
 
    (Julien Ponthus) 
    *****
       

    NOT MUCH OF A REBOUND IN SIGHT (0649 GMT) 
    The fact that S&P and Dow futures are in negative territory isn't doing much to beef up
morale and the same can be said about the end of the trading session in Asia.
    MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up just 0.13 percent and Chinese shares
took a hit as more evidence got about the economy slowing down. 
    There's really nothing much out there to substantiate hopes in a rebound just right now. 
    ""Stocks in Europe are expected to open around half a percentage point higher at the start of
the week providing some early relief, although as we’ve seen in the past in such environments,
this can very quickly change"", wrote Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. 
    It also looks unlikely that the UK budget, even with a promise to end austerity, or Merkel's
latest electoral defeat, will boost risk taking across European markets.

expressed are her own.)
    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hitachi <6501.T> has
clinched a score-draw with Paul Singer in Italy. The Japanese
conglomerate has agreed to pay 12.7 euros a share for Elliott’s
32 percent stake in rail-signalling group Ansaldo STS <STS.MI>,
which will soon help run and maintain metro lines in Riyadh. The
deal, a prerequisite to taking the Italian company private at
the same price, has something for both sides.
    The agreement ends a long-running Italian saga. Hitachi
bought an initial 40 percent stake in Ansaldo STS for 9.65 euros
a share from state-controlled defence group Finmeccanica back in
2015. But it angered minority investors when it offered to buy
them out at 9.5 euros – the same price net of dividend – in
2016. Singer and other activists such as Amber Capital rejected
the offer, arguing it did not reflect Hitachi’s above-market
price for Finmeccanica’s loss-making rail group AnsaldoBreda.
    Monday’s deal puts that right. At 12.7 euros per share the
deal gives Ansaldo STS an estimated enterprise value of about
2.2 billion euros after net cash. That is just over 18 times a
2017 EBITDA of 120 million euros, significantly higher than
rivals Alstom <ALSO.PA> and Siemens <SIEGn.DE> but not too far
from the 17.4 times Bombardier <BBDb.TO> is currently trading
at, Refinitiv data shows. 
    Ansaldo STS probably deserves a premium to the broader rail
sector as it is focused on the signalling technology needed to
run trains smoothly. Also, with Italian revenues representing
only about a quarter of the total, it has been insulated from a
recent domestic stock market rout.
    Hitachi gets the scope to rethink its role in Europe, which
may even see it choosing Italy as its new headquarters to retain
EU market access after Brexit. The purchase of Ansaldo STS’s
technology was supposed to help boost Hitachi’s international
presence, but CEO Andy Barr has been unable to grow revenue from
2015 levels while the row with investors dragged on. Meanwhile
rail mega-mergers in China and Europe have reshaped the global
sector and risk leaving Hitachi behind unless it teams up, for
instance with Bombardier. 
    With Elliott off its back, Hitachi can now ponder its future
without arguing about the past. 
    On Twitter https://twitter.com/LJucca
    
    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Hitachi has reached an agreement to buy the stake held by
activist hedge fund Elliott Management in Ansaldo STS. 
    - Under the deal, Hitachi will buy the 31.79 percent stake
that Elliott owns in Ansaldo for around 808 million euros ($920
million).
    - Hitachi will then launch a tender offer for the rest of
the company’s shares at 12.70 euros, a premium of 9.5 percent on
Friday’s closing price of 11.60 euros.
    - Elliott and other activist investors had argued that an
original 2016 tender offer by Hitachi at 9.5 euros a share was
too low.

    By Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - European shares climbed and Wall
Street was set for a stronger open on Monday thanks to a surge
in autos stocks and relief that Italy dodged a ratings
downgrade.
    Europe's autos sector <.SXAP> jumped 4.9 percent, set for
its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China
was considering halving the tax on car purchases in an attempt
to boost demand for autos, which has been hurt by a trade war
and slowing economic growth. [nL8N1X92LH] [nL3N1X940G]
    Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> jumped 2.1 percent by 1310 GMT,
boosted by carmakers BMW <BMWG.DE>, Daimler <DAIGn.DE> and
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, while the leading index of euro zone
stocks <.STOXX50E> rose 1.5 percent. 
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> led the market with a 2.4 percent
gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low
following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign
rating unchanged, prompting relief there was no ratings
downgrade. [nL8N1X92J0]
    This also pushed Italian bank stocks <.FTIT8300> up as much
as 4.5 percent, set for their strongest day since Sept. 10.
    Strong gains across Europe helped boost U.S. stock futures
back into the positive, with the Nasdaq futures <NQc1> up 1.4
percent, S&P 500 futures <ESc1> up 1.1 percent and Dow Jones
futures <1YMc1> up 0.7 percent.
    The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, tracking shares
in 47 countries, extended early gains to rise 0.4 percent. The
index is down 9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7
trillion in market capitalisation since its January peak.
    Investors shrugged off news German Chancellor Angela Merkel
would not seek re-election as party chairwoman, as she said she
would serve her full term as chancellor until 2021. Analysts saw
little likelihood of policy disruption. [nL8N1X92EG]
    Her decision, which followed bruising losses for her
Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse, heralded
the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. 
    Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting
on a turnaround in risk. 
    ""The only way I can summarize the core sentiment among the
European investors I met is something like 'pretty grim',"" wrote
Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, in a note to
clients.
    Overnight Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s
blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent.
    Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as
profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth
consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw
materials and manufactured goods. [nL3N1X700R]
    Global financial markets have been hit by negative factors
from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict to tensions in
Europe over Italy's budget and tightening monetary policy.
    Many indices are already in official correction territory
amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global
growth.
    ""With the volatility of the last week or so, today’s
stronger open to markets should not be seen as a sea change but
more a pause for breath,"" said Edward Park, investment director
at Brooks Macdonald. 
    Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European
earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak
results from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S.
stocks at the end of last week.
    
    BOLSONARO WIN BOOSTS EMERGING STOCKS
    Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> built on early gains to
climb 0.7 percent in their first rise in five sessions after
far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the runoff in Brazil's
presidential election. [nL2N1X803H]
    Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed on his win.
Blackrock's Latin American Investment Trust <BRLA.L>
London-listed shares gained 8.4 percent while a Germany-listed
iShares MSCI Brazil ETF <MBRABRL.DE> climbed 5.8 percent.
    ""Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is
that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing
the country's competitiveness,"" said UBS analysts. 
    Foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued with the
dollar index leading, up 0.3 percent. 
    The euro <EUR=> fell on the Merkel news, down 0.2 percent at
$1.1381. Sterling <GBP=> dipped 0.1 percent, near a two-month
trough of $1.2775 before Britain’s annual budget due later on
Monday. 
    Finance minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his
divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push
for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of
austerity.
    In commodities, oil prices dipped as investors priced in
growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude <CLc1> fell 43
cents to $67.17 per barrel and Brent crude <LCOc1> slid 44 cents
to $77.18.

    MARKETS' MOOD MUSIC PICKS UP - BUT FOR HOW LONG?  (1333 GMT)
    Today's strong recovery is spreading from Europe to the U.S. with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 up
1.3 percent each in early deals.
    ""Sometimes the mood music of the markets just changes: One minute everyone is happily
humming along to S Club, then someone puts on Leonard Cohen instead,"" quips Jim Wood-Smith, head
of research at Hawksmoor Investment Management. 
    Today investors are definitely in the more upbeat category - despite weak industrial data
from China which hurt U.S. futures and which some expected to hang over the European session
too.
    So why today's rally? 
    The main driver - excuse the pun - is car stocks <.SXAP> which are set for their strongest
day since August 2015 on a report China is considering halving the tax on car purchases. 
    Some say it was about time for a rally.
    ""I think everyone is a bit shell-shocked at the extent of the moves,"" says a trader,
highlighting how far the autos sector in particular has fallen this year. 
    Another strong boost came from S&P's decision not to downgrade its rating on Italy's
sovereign debt. 
    ""With this Italy buys time before the next potential rating action... Fitch will be next in
January 2019,"" write Credit Suisse analysts. 
    Here's a reminder of the damage done this year - nearly $7 trillion of market cap wiped from

    NO 'MERKEXIT' RALLY ON THE DAX (1230 GMT)
    News that Merkel will not be seeking re-election as CDU party chairwoman has coincided with
Germany's DAX set for its biggest jump since April. Is that the effect of 'Merkexit' on
investors?
    Likely not. 
    Berenberg's economist Holger Schmieding just told us that the German chancellor's
announcement she will step down after her term ends in 2021 ""adds an extra layer of uncertainty""
to the political future of the euro zone's powerhouse and certainly can't be seen as a positive
right now.
    On the contrary, chances are that decision-making will be put on hold in the short-term and
one can't really see what pro-business policies the departure of ""Mutti"" (Merkel's 'mom'
nickname) could accelerate, if any, he said. 
    Schmieding's analysis is therefore more in line with the euro falling briefly and German
government bond yields edging up.
    As for the DAX, there is little doubt that the surge in European car stocks following
Bloomberg's report on China planning to cut car purchase tax, is the main reason for its rise.
    Volkswagen is up 5.8 percent, Daimler 5 percent and BMW 3.9 percent.

    BANKS ""REMAIN A LONG-TERM VALUE TRAP"" (1417 GMT)
    With banks up 2.3 percent today you'd be forgiven for thinking the sector is back on
investors' ""buy"" list - but Berenberg remains pessimistic on the prospects for European lenders.
    ""The days when rising interest rates were seen as a silver bullet for bank earnings now seem
distant,"" write analysts at the German bank. ""Today, structural pressures on banking revenues
are more widely accepted.""
    While many investors are pointing to banks as the next big value play at bargain-basement
prices, Berenberg say it's best to stay away as cheap valuations are ""predicated on 3 percent
per year consensus revenue growth"".
    ""With this unlikely to be achieved, the sector remains a long-term value trap, in our view,""
they write.
    Overall analysts have cut their 12-month forward earnings growth expectations to the lowest
since Oct 2016, IBES Refinitiv data shows (see below).
    Berenberg's key sells in the sector are those ""most at risk of revenue downgrades"" - which
they say are Caixabank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse and Societe Generale. 
    They prefer lenders they see as more focused on costs - ING, Nordea, RBS, and UniCredit.

    By Aimee Donnellan
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ireland’s 500,000
euro salary limit for Allied Irish Bank’s CEO is why the
incumbent just quit. But that still buys a lot of Dublin
property, and need not deter global talent. Ambitious
high-flyers should see the chance to cut their teeth on AIB as
the path to a bigger CEO gig.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Outgoing Allied Irish Banks Chief Executive Bernard Byrne
is joining Ireland’s Davy Stockbrokers as its head of capital
markets and deputy chief executive, the country’s largest
stockbroker said on Oct 26.
    - AIB made the surprise announcement earlier on Oct. 26 that
Byrne would depart next year, leaving it looking for a new CEO
as well as a chief financial officer after Mark Bourke said last
month he was quitting.
    - Ireland introduced a ban on bonuses and a 500,000 euro pay
cap during the country’s most costly banking crisis a decade
ago. 
    - Shares in AIB have fallen 2.9 percent since the
announcement on Oct. 26. The shares were up 3 percent to 4.19
euros at 1436 GMT on Oct. 29.

    OLD-SCHOOL SELL-OFF (1456 GMT) 
    You'd think cyclicals would get smashed and defensives would be a better place to hide in a
sell-off and you'd be right - at least this year.
    ""The current sell-off is not that different from the one seen earlier in Q1 2018,"" Lyxor
analysts say, noting ""financials, industrials and materials underperformed the index during both
market events"" while ""defensive sectors such as utilities outperformed"".
    So one reassuring fact is that both in February and now, some basic market rules do apply. 
    Things are not entirely predictable though with consumer staples, communication services and
health care underperforming in February and outperforming in October. 
    ""Another difference is that IT stocks are no longer outperforming the overall index at
present,"" Lyxor writes, adding it doesn't believe equities have entered a bear market even
though volatility is bound to stay high in 2020.

    BANKS ""REMAIN A LONG-TERM VALUE TRAP"" (1417 GMT)
    With banks up 2.3 percent today you'd be forgiven for thinking the sector is back on
investors' ""buy"" list - but Berenberg remains pessimistic on the prospects for European lenders.
    ""The days when rising interest rates were seen as a silver bullet for bank earnings now seem
distant,"" write analysts at the German bank. ""Today, structural pressures on banking revenues
are more widely accepted.""
    While many investors are pointing to banks as the next big value play at bargain-basement
prices, Berenberg say it's best to stay away as cheap valuations are ""predicated on 3 percent
per year consensus revenue growth"".
    ""With this unlikely to be achieved, the sector remains a long-term value trap, in our view,""
they write.
    Overall analysts have cut their 12-month forward earnings growth expectations to the lowest
since Oct 2016, IBES Refinitiv data shows (see below).
    Berenberg's key sells in the sector are those ""most at risk of revenue downgrades"" - which
they say are Caixabank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse and Societe Generale. 
    They prefer lenders they see as more focused on costs - ING, Nordea, RBS, and UniCredit.

    MARKETS' MOOD MUSIC PICKS UP - BUT FOR HOW LONG?  (1333 GMT)
    Today's strong recovery is spreading from Europe to the U.S. with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 up
1.3 percent each in early deals.
    ""Sometimes the mood music of the markets just changes: One minute everyone is happily
humming along to S Club, then someone puts on Leonard Cohen instead,"" quips Jim Wood-Smith, head
of research at Hawksmoor Investment Management. 
    Today investors are definitely in the more upbeat category - despite weak industrial data
from China which hurt U.S. futures and which some expected to hang over the European session
too.
    So why today's rally? 
    The main driver - excuse the pun - is car stocks <.SXAP> which are set for their strongest
day since August 2015 on a report China is considering halving the tax on car purchases. 
    Some say it was about time for a rally.
    ""I think everyone is a bit shell-shocked at the extent of the moves,"" says a trader,
highlighting how far the autos sector in particular has fallen this year. 
    Another strong boost came from S&P's decision not to downgrade its rating on Italy's
sovereign debt. 
    ""With this Italy buys time before the next potential rating action... Fitch will be next in
January 2019,"" write Credit Suisse analysts. 
    Here's a reminder of the damage done this year - nearly $7 trillion of market cap wiped from
global stocks:

    NO 'MERKEXIT' RALLY ON THE DAX (1230 GMT)
    News that Merkel will not be seeking re-election as CDU party chairwoman has coincided with
Germany's DAX set for its biggest jump since April. Is that the effect of 'Merkexit' on
investors?
    Likely not. 
    Berenberg's economist Holger Schmieding just told us that the German chancellor's
announcement she will step down after her term ends in 2021 ""adds an extra layer of uncertainty""
to the political future of the euro zone's powerhouse and certainly can't be seen as a positive
right now.
    On the contrary, chances are that decision-making will be put on hold in the short-term and
one can't really see what pro-business policies the departure of ""Mutti"" (Merkel's 'mom'
nickname) could accelerate, if any, he said. 
    Schmieding's analysis is therefore more in line with the euro falling briefly and German
government bond yields edging up.
    As for the DAX, there is little doubt that the surge in European car stocks following
Bloomberg's report on China planning to cut car purchase tax, is the main reason for its rise.
    Volkswagen is up 5.8 percent, Daimler 5 percent and BMW 3.9 percent.

    LATE MORNING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE SEES BROAD BOUNCE (1123 GMT)
    The bounce we're seeing in Europe today is pretty broad with all country benchmarks and most
sectoral indexes trading firmly in the black. Relief over S&P's rating decision on Italy
[nL8N1X67LT], some good news from China for the auto sector [nL8N1X92LH] and strong results from
HSBC are lifting the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> up 1.3 percent, helping the market off earlier weakness
in Asia. 
    As you can see, Italy <.FTMIB> was the standout gainer, up 2.7 percent, while the German DAX
<.GDAXI> is also up a solid 2 percent as the rally in autos overshadows possible political risk
the euro zone's largest economy. [nS8N1WD01U]      
 
    Extra tidbit: five out of six stocks on the STOXX 600 were in positive territory.

    ON THE RADAR: HSBC IN THE SPOTLIGHT (0756 GMT) 
    Futures are indicating an open in positive territory even if there isn’t that much to cheer
up markets this morning between slower growth in China, another electoral blow for Merkel in
Hesse or the UK budget with an elusive promise to end austerity in Brexit-Britain.
    Today’s batch of macro indicators and Q3 earnings is also quite limited and it's definitely 
HSBC which is stealing the spotlight after beating forecasts for Q3. [nL3N1X54K0] 
    Still in the sector, Spain's Bankia Q3 net profit rose 1.7 pct and Deutsche Bank pulled the
sale of its Mexico unit to a local bank. [nL8N1X818B] 
    A few headlines in the pharmaceutical sector with Novartis, Pfizer joining forces on
potentially lucrative fatty liver disease, [nL8N1X66HA] and Takeda proposing to sell a drug to
win regulatory approval for Shire. [nL3N1X92S9]
    Kering announced it would buy back 1 percent of its shares and Daimler said it could
cooperate with Tesla in the future. 
    Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said it was planning to file
resolutions at Ryanair’s next AGM to replace Chairman David Bonderman. [nL8N1X80NQ]

    EUROPEAN FUTURES OPEN HIGHER (0713 GMT) 
    European futures have opened unequivocally in positive territory despite weakness in Asia,
particularly in China, and U.S futures trading in the red. 
    Indications from spreadbetters seeing a positive open in Europe are proving to be accurate: 
 
 
 
    (Julien Ponthus) 
    *****
       

    NOT MUCH OF A REBOUND IN SIGHT (0649 GMT) 
    The fact that S&P and Dow futures are in negative territory isn't doing much to beef up
morale and the same can be said about the end of the trading session in Asia.
    MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up just 0.13 percent and Chinese shares
took a hit as more evidence got about the economy slowing down. 
    There's really nothing much out there to substantiate hopes in a rebound just right now. 
    ""Stocks in Europe are expected to open around half a percentage point higher at the start of
the week providing some early relief, although as we’ve seen in the past in such environments,
this can very quickly change"", wrote Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. 
    It also looks unlikely that the UK budget, even with a promise to end austerity, or Merkel's
latest electoral defeat, will boost risk taking across European markets.

government's 2019 budget should prove less costly than
envisaged, the savings may be used to reduce the budget deficit,
a government source said on Monday.
    An early retirement option and a ""citizens' wage"" income
support scheme have been allocated around 17 billion euros in
the budget.
    However, the details of these measures, as well as their
timing, have not yet been fixed, and some of the funds may not
be used if the reforms are not launched until later in year.
    Any unused money may be dedicated to lowering the budget
deficit below the official target of 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product, the source said.

in the third quarter, albeit not as much as expected despite a
rebound in consumer spending and a stronger business investment,
according to data from the INSEE official statistics agency.
    The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4 percent in
the quarter, up from 0.2 percent in the previous three months, 
INSEE said on Tuesday in a first estimate for the July-September
period.
    However, the reading fell slightly short of an average
estimate for 0.5 percent growth in a Reuters poll of 31
economists. <FRGDPP=ECI>
    Household spending, traditionally the motor of French
growth, grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter after falling 0.1
percent in the previous three months as strikes hit spending on
transport in particular.
    Meanwhile, business investment accelerated slightly to 1.4
percent in the quarter as firms stepped up outlays on digital
technology while household investment, essentially new home
purchases, declined in line with recent falls in housing starts.
    Export growth outpaced that for imports, which meant that
foreign trade added 0.1 percentage points to overall growth,
while business inventory drawdowns subtracted 0.2 percentage
points.

 (Adds detail and background)
    By Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard
    PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, French
largest listed bank, said revenue in the third quarter dipped
due to weakness at its corporate and investment banking arm and
at its European retail banks.
    Revenues fell 0.4 percent to 10.35 billion euros, below the
10.61 billion expected by analysts, although growth at the
bank's international financial services division contributed to
an overall net profit rise of 4 percent to 2.12 billion euros.
    The bank's operating costs were up 2 percent in the quarter
as it spent more in technological overhauls. 
    ""However, the savings that will be generated going forward
in the next year should tilt us back again in positive
territory,"" BNP Paribas' Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil
said on Tuesday in a TV interview.   
    Large European banks such as BNP Paribas and HSBC <HSBA.L>,
which on Monday reported a surprisingly high profit, are
juggling to find new avenues of profits while at the same time
having to spend heavily to keep pace with fast-changing
technology and consumer habits.
    Revenues at BNP Paribas' retail banks in France, Belgium and
Italy remained weak as a result of persistently low interest
rates, while revenue from its corporate and investment banking
(CIB) unit fell again due to an adverse trading environment.
    BNP Paribas' international financial services arm, which has
been its growth engine in past quarters and includes consumer
lending and U.S. and emerging market retail banks, was one of
the group's better performing units in the third quarter. 
    However, that unit's performance nevertheless slowed down in
the third quarter compared to previous quarters mainly due to
the depreciation of the Turkish lira.

    * Merkel giving up on party leadership and re-election
    * New hiatus seen holding up possible euro zone reforms
    * Regional elections have seen eurosceptic gains
    * But some see possible new EU reform push from Berlin

    By Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's announcement
that she will step down as party leader and, in time, as German
chancellor jams a wrench into EU reforms but might just
eventually, some think, invigorate Berlin's key role in European
integration.
    Merkel, 64, said her fourth term, ending in 2021, would be
her last. For many European Union policymakers and analysts
picking over a historic day, the consequence is likely to be
prolonged paralysis and a Germany less inclined to share its
wealth and locked in confrontation with its neighbours.
    Some, though, see at least a chance that the shock,
triggered by poor regional election results, could in time lead
to a new coalition more committed to strengthening the EU. This
might mean a role for the resurgent, europhile Greens, or Merkel
herself seeking to burnish her European legacy in defiance of
many of her own Christian Democrats in parliament.
    ""For the European Union, this comes at the worst possible
moment to have (agree) anything at the December Council,"" said
Lucas Guttenberg, deputy director in Berlin of the Jacques
Delors Institute think-tank, devoted to European integration.
    Pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron and others to
agree measures to strengthen the shared euro currency may be
frustrated again at the Dec. 13-14 summit, as Merkel may have to
defer on key issues to a new CDU leader chosen a week earlier.
    While ministers have agreed some minor tweaks to euro zone
rules, Macron's ambitions for a grand new construction - and
hopes for wider EU reforms in the wake of Brexit - must be
dimmed: ""Her room for manoeuvre was already quite constrained,""
said Guttenberg, noting that it took six months to form Merkel's
present coalition. ""For Macron or others, it's not good news.""
    For others, however, a showdown with Italy over its plans
for a radically expansive budget next year despite big debts has
already killed off much ambition in Brussels, making Merkel's
weaker position in Berlin less of a deciding factor.
    
    ELECTION TROUBLE
    Rather, her electoral problems showed a further decline for
traditional big parties, a trend that has profited both Macron
and also eurosceptics such as Italy's new ruling coalition,
several EU diplomats in Brussels and other capitals said.
    And in that, the dimming of Merkel's influence after 13
years as Europe's key power-broker could mean trouble ahead as
EU leaders try to resolve new confrontations.
    ""Germany will be absent,"" said a senior diplomat in eastern
Europe. ""Getting things done will be even more complicated.""
    Merkel played a key role in tempering German hawks when it
came to north-south divides over public finances in the euro
zone. More recently, she has helped to bridge splits between
east and west over EU subsidies and civil rights, drawing in
part on her experience of living in Soviet-bloc East Germany.
    ""For central and eastern Europe, having someone as German
chancellor who actually knows what it is to live under Communist
dictatorship was an enormous privilege, the importance of which
we will only really learn when it's over,"" the eastern diplomat
said.
    Guttenberg at the Delors Institute expected Germany to
maintain its broadly pro-EU consensus and stick to established
lines on Britain's new place outside the bloc and in resisting
Rome's bid to tear up spending rules.
    But ""constructive"" moves to deepen integration would be on
hold: ""I do not expect revolutions.""
    
    MACRON MOMENT?
    On the other side, economists at Citibank wrote that
electoral success for the Greens could be positive for those
seeing euro zone reform as good for the economy and even provoke
a ""Macron moment"" in Germany, with the emergence of a broadly
backed centrist movement to tackle problems.
    ""The rise of the pro-EU Greens (is) a significant potential
positive, at least for the euro zone,"" they wrote.
    Among sceptics, however, is Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian
co-leader of the Greens in the EU parliament, who noted that
Green successes have been matched by the rise of eurosceptics:
""If Merkel loses control of the CDU, it is the very idea of
European integration in Germany that will lose.""
    One hope, he said, was that Merkel could now afford to spend
her political capital on pushing Germans to accept changes that
would mould the euro less to their own national advantage - a
view echoed by ING Germany economist Carsten Brzeski, who wrote:
    ""It could give Merkel the freedom and tailwind ... to put a
final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform
the German economy and the monetary union.""
    At the Friends of Europe think-tank in Brussels, chairman
Giles Merritt argued that Merkel has brought ""inertia"" to the
EU, and a failure to rein in German surpluses that have strained
the single currency to breaking point, threatening the Union.
    ""Fears of post-Merkel volatility and even chaos are
understandable, but short-sighted,"" said Merritt. ""It's to be
hoped that the prospect of her stepping down will act as a
catalyst and bring home to German voters their greater
self-interest, which is European cohesion, not short-term gain.""

    MADRID, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA <BBVA.MC> said on
Tuesday its third-quarter net profit rose 46 percent, buoyed by
one-off capital gains in Chile and a solid performance in Mexico
that partially offset pressure on lending income.
    Spain's second-largest bank reported net profit of 1.67

euros after it completed the sale of a 68 percent stake in BBVA

    As with other European banks, Spanish lenders are struggling
to improve their financial margins due to ultra-low interest
rates.
    Overall, net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on
loans minus deposit costs, was 4.26 billion euros in the third
quarter, down 3.3 percent from a year ago and down 2.3 percent
from the preceding quarter.
    Analysts had forecast a NII of 4.13 billion euros.
    In Argentina, where the bank makes less than 5 percent of
its operating income, the bank booked a loss of 190 million 
euros in the quarter after it restated its financial statement
to take into account hyperinflation.
    In Turkey, the lender's fourth-biggest market after Mexico,
Spain, and the United States, BBVA's net profit dived 40.7
percent after the lira slumped in August.
    In its main market of Mexico, the company's net profit
climbed 18.5 percent to 642 million euros, underpinned by
stronger lending activity.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives urged the head of the
allied Bavarian CSU party to follow her example and step down as
party leader after poor election results, in an interview
published on Tuesday.
    Merkel said on Monday that her fourth term as chancellor
would be her last and that she would step down as leader of the
Christian Democrats (CDU), heralding the end of a 13-year era in
which she has dominated European politics. [nL8N1X926U]
    Her decision followed two state elections in Bavaria and
Hesse where the parties in Merkel's governing coalition suffered
heavy losses, a result partly blamed on infighting between the
CDU and its Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party.
    Tobias Hans, CDU premier in the western state of Saarland,
called on CSU leader Horst Seehofer - who as interior minister
in Merkel's federal government unsettled voters by criticising
the chancellor - to follow suit and step down.
    ""The fact is that Angela Merkel has given an example of how
to take responsibility after a poor election result,"" Hans told
Die Welt newspaper.
    ""Angela Merkel has managed to deliver a self-determined
departure as party leader, this is also my wish for colleague
Horst Seehofer,"" Hans added.
    There was no immediate response from Seehofer.
    Several CDU politicians have announced they want to succeed
Merkel as party leader at a conference in December, including
CDU party secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a close
Merkel ally, and Health Minister Jens Spahn who is one of her
fiercest critics. [nL8N1X94U2]

    By Leigh Thomas
    PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - French economic growth picked up
by less than expected in the three months to September despite a
rebound in consumer spending, official data showed on Tuesday,
putting pressure on the government's full year growth forecast.
    The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4 percent in
the third quarter, up from 0.2 percent in the previous three
months, the INSEE statistics agency said in a first estimate for
the period.
    ""Today’s outturn marks the return of where French GDP growth
should be at this stage of the business cycle – above potential,
absorbing slack – and with it, should mark the end of material
underperformance against the euro area,"" Barclays economist
Francois Cabau said in a research note.
    However, the reading fell short of an average estimate for
0.5 percent growth in a Reuters poll of 31 private sector
economists, as well as INSEE's own 0.5 percent forecast. 
    Economists said the reading meant the economy would need to
grow by about 0.8 percent in the last quarter to attain the 1.7
percent rate the government is forecasting for the full year.
    Morgan Stanley economist Matthew Pennil said fourth quarter
growth was likely to be closer to 0.4 percent judging by recent
business confidence surveys and despite a cut in workers'
welfare contributions this month.
    ""Volatility in quarterly growth this year has largely been
driven by tax policy,"" Pennil said.
    ""Measures that lowered household incomes early this year are
only now being offset by reductions in social contributions,
which are fueling a recovery in consumer spending.""
         
    BREAKDOWN
    Household spending, traditionally the motor of French
growth, grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter after falling 0.1
percent in the previous three months, when strikes hit spending
on transport in particular. 
    ""We have a return to normal rather than the recovery of lost
ground since the last quarter of 2017,"" Euler Hermes economist
Stephane Colliac told Reuters.
    Business investment accelerated slightly to 1.4 percent in
the quarter, remaining the main source of momentum as firms
respond positively to President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business
reform push. Household investment, essentially new home
purchases, declined in line with recent falls in housing starts.
    Export growth outpaced that for imports, which meant that
foreign trade added 0.1 percentage points to overall growth,
while business inventory drawdowns subtracted 0.2 percentage
points.

    By Jesús Aguado
    MADRID, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Net profit at Spanish bank BBVA
<BBVA.MC> rose 46 percent in the third quarter thanks to growth
in lending in its top market of Mexico, offsetting a decline in
Turkey due to the depreciation of the lira.
    Like Spanish rival Santander <SAN.MC>, BBVA makes most of
its profit overseas, a model that helped it to counter a
double-dip recession at home in recent years.
    One-off capital gains in Chile of 633 million euros helped
Spain's second biggest lender increase its net profit by 46
percent to 1.67 billion euros ($1.90 billion) in the July to
September period, in line with analysts' forecasts.
    This net gain also contributed to improve the bank's core
tier-1 fully load capital ratio - the strictest measure of
solvency - by 50 basis points to 11.34 percent at end-September
compared to 10.8 percent in June. On an underlying basis,
capital was down 6 basis points against the previous quarter.
    Excluding one-off operations, net profit in the quarter
would have fallen 9 percent to 1.04 billion euros, also in part
due to higher provisions.
    In its main market of Mexico, the company's net profit
climbed 18.5 percent to 642 million euros ($730.34 million),
underpinned by stronger lending activity.
    Shares in BBVA rose 0.7 percent after results were broadly
welcomed by analysts.
    ""Overall, we regard these as sound numbers by BBVA under
challenging conditions, which underpins our thesis about gradual
normalisation of Spain's earnings and structurally high returns
in (some) emerging markets,"" UBS said in a note to analysts.
    However as with other European banks, Spanish lenders are
struggling to improve their financial margins due to ultra-low
interest rates.
    Overall, net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on
loans minus deposit costs, was 4.26 billion euros in the third
quarter, down 3.3 percent from a year ago and down 2.3 percent
from the preceding quarter.
    Analysts had forecast a NII of 4.13 billion euros.
    In Argentina, where the bank makes less than 5 percent of
its operating income, the bank booked a loss of 190 million
euros in the quarter after it restated its financial statement
to take into account hyperinflation though it also booked a
positive impact on equity of 104 million euros.
    In Turkey, the lender's fourth-biggest market after Mexico,
Spain, and the United States, BBVA's net profit dived 40.7
percent after the lira slumped in August.
    However, the lender managed to partially offset an increase
in provisions in Turkey on its NII as it benefited from higher
inflation due to the bank's hedging strategy in its fixed-income
portfolio.
    BBVA reduced its non-performing loans ratio to 4.1 percent
compared to 4.4 percent in the second quarter at a moment when
the European Central Bank (ECB) is urging lenders to remove
toxic assets from its balance sheet.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Soured credit, cybercrime and
Brexit are among the biggest risks facing euro zone banks in
2019, the European Central Bank said on Tuesday, as it set out
its supervisory priorities for the year ahead. 
    The euro zone's growth has reduced overall economic
uncertainty, but global risk factors from protectionism to a
hard Brexit and emerging-market turmoil are growing and warrant
closer monitoring, the central bank said. It keeps watch over
118 of the biggest euro zone banks. 
    ""Compared to last year, there has been a substantial
decrease in risks stemming from economic and fiscal conditions
in the euro area, mostly due to a favourable cyclical momentum,""
the ECB said in a regular risk assessment exercise.
    ""At the same time, geopolitical uncertainties and risks of
repricing in financial markets have increased. Advances in
digitalisation exacerbate the risks related to banks’ legacy IT
systems and cyberattacks.""
    Other notable risks include a repricing in financial markets
and the impact of record-low interest rates on bank
profitability, it added.
    With regard to Brexit, the ECB stressed that banks need to
be ready for any outcome, since no agreement has been reached
just months before Britain is due to exit the European Union. 
    ""Banks' preparedness for Brexit remains a high priority for
ECB Banking Supervision,"" the ECB said. ""ECB Banking Supervision
will further prepare to take over the direct supervision of a
number of institutions that are newly identified as significant
owing to the Brexit-induced relocation of activities.""
    It added that it will continue to press banks to reduce
their stock of non-performing loans after notable progress this
year and will also scrutinize lending practices to mitigate
potential risks.
    It will also conduct a targeted review of banks' internal
models for calculating risk to reduce unwarranted deviation from
its own expectation.

    Eurostat does not provide national data in its flash
estimates, but figures released earlier on Tuesday by the
Italian statistics agency showed Italy's growth had halted in
the third quarter amid a row with the European Union over the
country's budget for next year [nR1N1W500K].
    In a separate release, the European Commission said on
Tuesday economic sentiment dropped in the euro zone for the
tenth consecutive month, and by more than expected by
economists.
    The indicator, that shows managers and consumers' morale,
fell to 109.8 points in October from 110.9 in September in its
biggest dip since March.
    Although it remains above the long-term average, the
indicator has been falling since the beginning of the year after
having risen steadily in 2017.
    In October the largest fall was recorded in retail services
as managers held ""much grimmer views on the present and expected
business situation,"" the Commission said and the indicator of
selling price expectations dropped. 
    Confidence in industry and services also went down, while
consumer sentiment grew slightly on improved savings
expectations.
    Among euro zone countries, economic morale fell in Germany,
France and Italy, the three largest economies of the bloc, while
it grew in Spain.
    In Italy the downward trend, which is coupled with economic
stagnation in the third quarter, began in July, the month after
a eurosceptic government took office in Rome.
    Outside the euro zone, Britain recorded a slight increase of
economic sentiment, driven up by more optimism in retail trade
and services which more than offset a fall in industry
confidence.

 (Recasts with Africa summit)
    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
hosts African leaders on Tuesday in a drive to tackle
underdevelopment on the continent that helped to spur mass
migration, shaping the later years of her long premiership.
    Merkel announced on Monday she would retire from politics by
2021, sending shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to
succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 leaders including South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and
Rwanda's Paul Kagame, is designed to showcase the continent as a
stable destination for German investment.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which along with political instability and violence has
encouraged large numbers to head for Europe.
    ""We have to make sure we don't stay in aid mode,"" Merkel's
Africa coordinator Guenter Nooke told public radio. ""The many
millions of jobs we need in Africa can't be created with public
money.""
    If Merkel is to ensure the leadership of her Christian
Democrat party passes to a centrist ally, such as current
general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, she needs to show
that she has made progress in fixing the conditions that led to
her fateful decision three years ago.
    Other candidates, including Health Minister Jens Spahn or
her old rival, the strongly pro-business Friedrich Merz, are
well to her right politically and could be expected to want to
challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to
refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as
Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of
the human tide.
    The crisis upturned European politics, revitalising the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    But officials around the chancellor believe that migration
can only be slowed sustainably by removing the ""push"" factors of
unemployment and instability in Africa, something that will only
be exacerbated by climate change.
    Officials hope that the summit, attended also by Christine
Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
will encourage more companies to invest on the continent,
creating jobs that aid has failed to do. 
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
has said she will not seek re-election as leader of the
centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) at a congress in
December. Merkel, 64, also ruled out running for a fifth term as
chancellor in 2021.
    Several CDU politicians have announced bids to succeed
Merkel as party leader. Here are some facts about the candidates
who could step into Merkel's shoes:
            
    THE MINI-MERKEL
    Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, probably has the best chance
of becoming the next CDU leader after Merkel herself decided in
February to name her as party secretary general - a move seen as
a succession plan.
    Dubbed a ""mini-Merkel"" by German media due to their sober
political styles, Kramp-Karrenbauer was premier of the tiny
state of Saarland on the French border from 2011 to 2018.
    Her Catholic, western German background contrasts with
Merkel's Protestant, eastern roots. While socially conservative
and known for opposing gay marriage, Kramp-Karrenbauer is also a
strong supporter of the minimum wage and workers' rights.
    In an attempt to distance herself from Merkel and her
leadership style, Kramp-Karrenbauer has said the CDU will need
to regain some passion if it wants to attract younger voters.
    Sometimes known as AKK, she is the daughter of a teacher for
mentally handicapped children, and is married to a mining
engineer, with whom she has three children.
           
    THE CRITIC
    Jens Spahn, 38, has become one of Merkel's most outspoken
critics within the CDU since her decision in 2015 to welcome
more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims from war zones in
the Middle East.
    He positions himself as a politician from Germany's rural
northwest who is sceptical of urban liberals and the globalist
elite.
    In an attempt to rein Spahn in, Merkel this year named him
health minister - a thorny portfolio that brings a lot of work
and few headlines.
    A member of the lower house of parliament since 2002, Spahn
has been praised as a rising star for years by senior
conservatives such as Wolfgang Schaeuble.
    However, his anti-immigration rhetoric at the height of the
refugee crisis cost him sympathy among Merkel allies.
    His public friendship with Richard Grenell, U.S. President
Donald Trump's ambassador to Berlin, has also alienated some
conservatives who dislike Trump's policy style.
    Like Kramp-Karrenbauer, Spahn is a Catholic but, despite the
church's opposition to gay partnerships, he is married to Daniel
Funke, a senior journalist at the glossy magazine Bunte.
        
    THE OUTSIDER
    Friedrich Merz, 62, was the first to throw his hat into the
ring on Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again
as CDU leader, according to party sources. He confirmed his
plans officially on Tuesday.
    Merz, a member of the CDU's conservative wing, has coined
the idea of a German 'Leitkultur', or 'lead culture', with which
he called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German
values and traditions.
    He also is known for his proposal to simplify the annual tax
return so that it could be written on a beer mat.
    Merz is among the many conservative men who have seen their
political fortunes dwindle under Merkel.
    In 2002, Merkel pushed him out of his position as CDU
parliamentary leader to cement her grip on the party, on her way
to becoming chancellor in 2005.
    A trained lawyer and former member of the European
Parliament, Merz served in the German parliament from 1994 to
2009, and now holds numerous non-executive company board
positions, including chairman of the German arm of the U.S.
hedge fund BlackRock.
    He is married to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has
three children.

 (Adds PM comment, quotes, confidence data, background)
    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Italy's economy stagnated in the
third quarter, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the zero
growth justified Rome's expansionary 2019 budget which the
European Commission has rejected because it breaks EU rules.
    Gross domestic product was unchanged between July and
September, following a 0.2 percent rise in the second quarter,
and was up just 0.8 percent on an annual basis, national
statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
    The flat quarterly reading was the weakest since the fourth
quarter of 2014, and continues a steady slowdown in Italian
growth over the last 18 months.
    ""The figures were expected, which is why we presented an
expansionary budget,"" Conte told reporters during a visit to
India.
    Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is in Doha, gave
the same message. ""The slowing GDP is another reason to go full
steam ahead with the budget,"" he said on Facebook. 
    This month the government, which took office in June, cut
the full-year 2018 GDP growth forecast to 1.2 percent from a 1.5
percent projection made in April by the previous administration.
    After the third quarter stagnation, achieving even the
revised target would need a strong acceleration at the end of
the year.
    The new coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement
and the right-wing League has presented a big-spending 2019
budget it says is needed to prevent Italy's chronically sluggish
economy slipping into another recession.
    However the budget, which targets the deficit to rise to 2.4
percent of GDP in 2019 from 1.8 percent this year, was rejected
last week by the European Commission.
    The EU executive said Italy was flouting a previous
commitment to lower the deficit steadily towards a balanced
budget, and gave Rome three weeks to present a new budget. The 
government says it has no intention of changing its plans.
    Yields on Italian government bonds rose after the GDP data
and the euro fell. [nL8N1XA3JZ] [nL2N1XA0C5]
    ISTAT said neither trade flows nor domestic demand had made
any contribution to economic growth in the third quarter.
    It gave no numerical breakdown of components with its
preliminary estimate, but said the services and agricultural
sectors expanded while industry was a drag on growth.
    The government has forecast growth will accelerate to 1.5
percent next year thanks to increased investment, tax cuts and a
new income support scheme, known as the ""citizens' wage"", which
it says can boost consumer spending.
    While the weak economy may strengthen Rome's argument that
fiscal expansion is needed, the coalition's forecasts - which
were already above those of virtually all independent economists
- now look increasingly optimistic.
    The third quarter data ""puts an end to the expectations that
the government has that they can base their budget on their
current growth projections"", said ING rates strategist Benjamin
Schroeder. 
    Separately, ISTAT reported that business confidence dropped
in October to its weakest for almost two years, but morale
improved among consumers, possibly buoyed by the budget's
planned tax cuts, welfare benefits and early-retirement option.

    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
hosted African leaders on Tuesday, pledging a new development
fund to tackle underdevelopment on the continent that has helped
to spur mass migration, shaping the later years of her long
premiership.
    Merkel announced on Monday she would retire from politics by
2021, sending shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to
succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 leaders including South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and
Rwanda's Paul Kagame, is designed to showcase the continent as a
stable destination for German investment.
    The International Monetary Fund's Managing Director
Christine Lagarde is also there, along with a host of
international development officials.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which along with political instability and violence has
encouraged large numbers to head for Europe.
    ""We Europeans have a great interest in African states having
a bright economic outlook,"" Merkel said in her opening speech,
announcing a fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises
from both Europe and Africa to invest on the continent.
    Germany has already introduced tax incentives for its
companies to set up plants in Africa, reflecting Merkel's view
that state aid must give way to private investment if jobs are
to be created in their millions.
    If Merkel is to ensure the leadership of her Christian
Democrat party passes to a centrist ally, such as current
general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, she needs to show
that she has made progress in fixing the conditions that led to
her fateful decision three years ago.
    Other candidates, including Health Minister Jens Spahn or

challenge much of her legacy.

from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    By Maurice Tamman
    LISBON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A priest in a white robe swings
an incense burner, leading the way for thousands of marchers as
they cram into a winding cobblestone alley decorated with
candy-colored streamers in Lisbon's ancient Alfama neighborhood.
    Behind the priest, six men carry a life-sized statue of
Saint Anthony, Lisbon's patron saint, born more than 800 years
ago. The musky incense swirls together with the smoke from
orange-hot charcoals grilling whole sardines a few streets away.
The procession moves along, leaving behind just the smell of the
sardines. 
    In this city, June is the month to celebrate the saints.
Almost every neighborhood throws a party, known as an arraial.
Some are just a scattering of makeshift tables in alleyways.
Others cover several blocks and are jammed with tourists and
locals alike. The saints are quickly forgotten in the din of
pumping pop music, longing fado songs, brass bands, chattering
families, indiscreet lovers and flirty teens. The sardines are
not. They're the star of every party. 
    The fish are so popular here, fisheries managers estimate
that the Portuguese collectively eat 13 sardines every second
during a typical June – about 34 million fish for the month.
    But as climate change warms the seas and inland estuaries,
sardines are getting harder and harder to catch. Just a week
before the festival, authorities postponed sardine fishing in
some ports out of a fear that the diminishing population,
vulnerable to changes in the Atlantic's water temperatures, was
being overfished. 
    In the last few decades, the world's oceans have undergone
the most rapid warming on record. Currents have shifted. These
changes are for the most part invisible. But this hidden climate
change has had a disturbing impact on marine life – in effect,
creating an epic underwater refugee crisis.
    Drawing on decades of maritime temperature readings, fishery
records and other little-used data, Reuters has undertaken an
extensive exploration of the disrupted deep. A team of reporters
has discovered that from the waters off the East Coast of the
United States to the shores of West Africa, marine creatures are
fleeing for their lives, and the communities that depend on them
are facing turbulence as a result.
    Here in Lisbon, the decline of the country's most beloved
fish tugs at the Portuguese soul. A nation clinging to the
western edge of the European continent, Portugal has always
turned toward the sea. For centuries, it has sent its people
onto the sometimes-treacherous oceans, from famous explorers
like Ferdinand Magellan and Vasco da Gama to little-known
fishermen who left weeping wives on the shore. 
    The St. Anthony's festival commemorates a 13th-century
priest who, church doctrine says, once drew a bay full of fish
to hear his sermon. It is the capital's biggest, most joyous
celebration of the year. 
    At the bottom of the track where two bright yellow funicular
trains begin and end an 800-foot vertiginous trip through the
Bica neighborhood, a social club and a local cafe have set up
for the festival. On this night, it's mostly locals, though a
few German and French tourists have found their way to the
party.
    Four friends sit around a wobbly plastic table perched
outside the G.D. Zip Zip social club. There's just enough room
for others to walk past and get to the homemade grill where the
sardines are being cooked. Three of the friends have sardine
skeletons and heads heaped on their plates. They talk about the
fish that's as iconic in Portugal in the summer as a hamburger
on the grill in America. 
    This year, however, because of limits on fishing, it's
mostly only frozen fish that are available.
    ""We listen to it all year round that maybe this year, we
will not have sardines,"" Helena Melo says.
    Fifteen feet up the hill, Jorge Rito, who has been cooking
for the club every June for five years, wipes his watering eyes
with the back of his hand. He's just gotten another order and
tosses a dozen whole sardines onto the grill in neat rows.
    As he flips the silvery fish, each seven or eight inches
long, a burst of smoke rises from the charcoal, and he wipes his
eyes again. 
    ""Worried? Yes, of course,"" he says, removing the fish from
the grill and placing them onto a platter. ""It is important for
our finances, our economies, for us."" 
    
    WARMING WATERS THREATEN BABY SARDINES
    Just as the next generation of humans may pay the highest
price for climate change, the youngest generation of sardines is
at risk.
    Susana Garrido, a sardine researcher with the Portuguese
Oceanic and Atmospheric Institute in Lisbon, says larval
sardines are especially vulnerable to climate change when
compared to other similar pelagic species, such as larval
anchovies, which are capable of living in a wider range of
temperatures.  
    Deep seawater upwelling dominates the waters off the western
coast of the Iberian Peninsula and keeps the coastal waters
cool. But small differences in temperature, especially when
sardines are young, can have a significant impact on whether the
fish larva dies or grows to maturity, Garrido says. 
    Other researchers had tested how well adult sardines
survived in a variety of conditions, and there was little
evidence that environmental variables such as food abundance and
water temperature affected the full-grown fish, she says. So she
focused on the larval stage of the species.
    ""We did a bunch of experiments varying salinity and all of
these other variables, and they survived quite well,"" she says.
""It was when you change temperature that everything, yes, fell
apart. So they have a very narrow range of temperatures where
survival is good."" 
    Garrido says a recently completed stock assessment shows
that the larval sardine population is extremely low.
    ""This is getting very serious,"" she says.
    The Portuguese sardine population started to fall about a
decade ago, even though there were plenty of adults at the time
to sustain large catches. And around the same time, southerly
species, such as chub and horse mackerel, slowly moved in.
    Chub mackerel, a subtropical species that was once found
only in southern Portugal, is now caught all the way up the
coast.
    ""Probably as a consequence of warming, it is now invading
the main spawning area of sardines,"" Garrido says.
    Alexandra Silva, who works down the hall from Garrido, has
been managing the Portuguese sardine stock assessment since the
late 1990s – pivotal work that the organization uses to decide
the size of the sardine catch.
    When she started, the northern population of the species was
in trouble following a period of strong upwelling that brought
unusually cold water to the surface. The southern stock,
however, was relatively healthy. And in the early years of the
century, the species recovered.
    It was not to last. These days, without large numbers of
larvae growing to maturity, the population is near collapse all
along the coast from Galicia in Spain to the southern end of the
Portuguese coast. 
    All officials can do is cut down on the fishing. But larger
forces, especially climate change, are now affecting the stock
in ways that fisheries managers cannot control, the two say.
    Regulators have tried.
    Starting in 2004, they blocked fishing during the spring,
when sardines spawn. And for a while, that seemed to work.
Between 2004 and 2011, the stock remained relatively healthy,
with landings ranging from about 55,000 to 70,000 tons, even if
the population seemed to be dipping. (From the 1930s to the
1960s, and as recently as the 1980s, fishermen landed more than
110,000 tons in a year.)
    In 2009, the Portuguese proudly announced that the Marine
Stewardship Council, an independent monitoring body, had
designated the species healthy and sustainable. That year,
Portuguese fishermen landed 64,000 tons of the fish. By 2012,
however, that number had dropped to 35,000 tons, and the country
lost its sustainable certification. Since then, fisheries
managers have restricted the number of days a week that
fishermen can catch sardines, the size of the catch, and
restricted fishing to only six months during a year. 
    Last year, the catch was limited to about 14,000 tons.
    Earlier this year, the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea, a forum of scientists that advises
governments about fishery management, warned that it would take
at least 15 years to restore the stock at current fishing
levels. After the report, European Union regulators permitted
fishermen along the Iberian coast to continue at the current
16,100-ton level. But it also required Portugal, which gets the
bulk of the quota, and Spain to submit a plan to restore the
stock in October, which may well lead to further quota cuts.
    Fisheries manager Jorge Abrantes handles landings for
Peniche, a sleepy fishing town about 60 miles north of Lisbon.
He doesn't think the fishing industry is the culprit.
    For example, Portuguese government stock assessments
indicated that the sardine population had decreased by 10
percent to 25 percent in just a few months. Abrantes argues that
the dip clearly wasn't caused by fishermen pulling sardines from
the sea, because no sardine nets were in the water during that
period. Instead, he says, there are just not enough juvenile
sardines to replenish the population. 
    In Peniche, fishermen Erbes Martins and João Dias sit among
piles of nets on a bright but chilly February morning. The two
75-year-old men would prefer to be fishing for sardines. But the
fish are spawning, so they're not allowed to catch them.
    Sure, there are other fish they could catch, but it's not
worth it, they say.
    Horse mackerel, or carapau in Portuguese, one of the
southerly species that now thrive all along the coast, is
abundant but doesn't sell for much at market, Dias says.
    ""We can't fish for sardines in October, November, December,
January, February, March, six months,"" Dias says. ""And carapau
just doesn't pay the bills."" 
    He says the restrictions on fishing sardines are keeping a
new generation from going to sea, because they can't make enough
money.
    ""When we die,"" he says, ""no one is going to do the work."" 
    
    'I WOULD MISS THIS VERY MUCH'
    Lisbon's Graça neighborhood sits at the highest point in the
capital, its pastel homes looking down over the city's six other
hills. For the St. Anthony festival, two stages have been set up
for music, along with about 20 temporary food and drink stalls.
    Luis Diogo Sr., his wife, Rita, and their two children, Luis
Jr. and Vera, have come out to join the party. Luis Sr. looks
across a picnic table at his son, who is well into his third
plate of sardines. 
    ""This is a country between Spain and the sea, so we went to
the sea very soon in our history,"" he says. The talk turns to
the present, and the dwindling catch of the city's favorite
seafood.
    Luis Jr. doesn't pay much attention to his father. He's too
focused on his sardines. 
    ""I would miss this very much,"" the 17-year-old says, wiping
his lips clean after polishing off the last sardine on his
plate.

 (Adds Egypt's Sisi, statistics on European investment in
Africa)
    By Thomas Escritt
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
pledged on Tuesday a new development fund to tackle unemployment
in Africa, a problem spurring the mass migration that has shaped
her long premiership as it nears its end.
    Merkel hosted a summit of African leaders a day after
announcing she would retire from politics by 2021, sending
shockwaves across Europe and starting a race to succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 presidents and prime
ministers including Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, South Africa's
Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Rwanda's Paul Kagame,
is designed to showcase the continent as a stable destination
for German investment.
    International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine
Lagarde is also there, along with a host of international
development officials.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which, along with political instability and violence,
has encouraged large numbers to head for Europe. But with
Africa's population growing at almost three percent a year, the
task is enormous.
    ""We Europeans have a great interest in African states having
a bright economic outlook,"" Merkel said in her opening speech,
announcing the fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises
from both Europe and Africa to invest on the continent.
    The 119,000 Africans who arrived in Europe in 2018,
according to the International Organisation for Migration, are
the tip of the iceberg. International Labour Organisation
figures show that 16 million migrants were on the move within
Africa in 2014. 
    While European Union countries invested $22 billion in
Africa in 2017, breakneck economic growth will be needed to help
bring down the migrant numbers. 
    Berlin hopes Germany's manufacturing-based economy, which
drove Eastern Europe's rapid economic growth after the 1989
collapse of Communism, could turn things round.
    Merkel needs results fast if she is to ensure the leadership
of her Christian Democrats passes to a centrist ally, such as
current general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, although
she has declined to back anyone openly.
    
    A MARSHALL PLAN FOR AFRICA?
    Other candidates for the party leadership, including Health
Minister Jens Spahn or her old rival, the strongly pro-business
Friedrich Merz, are well to her right politically and could be
expected to want to challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel has said she will remain chancellor but that her
current, fourth term up to 2021 will be her last.   
    Germany has introduced tax incentives for its companies to
set up plants in Africa, reflecting her view that state aid must
give way to private investment if jobs are to be created in
their millions. 
    This would be part of a ""Marshall Plan for Africa"" - named
after the U.S.-funded plan that helped to rebuild European
states including Germany after World War Two - that she sees as
central to her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders to
refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East as well as
Africa as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of
the human tide.
    The crisis upturned European politics, revitalising the
Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the

into parliament in last year's election.
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-Paris-October 30: This announcement replaces the version published 
on 26 October to add a missing sentence in the Derivation Summary section.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed French automotive supplier Faurecia's S.A.'s 
Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB+'. The Outlook is Stable.

The rating action reflects the mildly positive effect from the acquisition of 
Clarion on Faurecia's business profile and moderately negative impact on the 
group's credit metrics. We project funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net 
leverage to increase to about 2.3x at end-2019, from 1.6x at end-2017, but still 
below our negative sensitivity of 2.5x.

We believe this transaction reinforces Faurecia's footprint in the more 
highly-technological and faster-growing segments of automotive infotainment, 
connectivity and advanced driver-assistance systems as well as gain a recognised 
brand name and enhance the group's exposure to Asia and the US.

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Leading Market Positions: The ratings of Faurecia are supported by its 
diversification, size and leading market positions as the 10th-largest global 
automotive supplier. Its large and diversified portfolio is a strength in the 
global automotive market, which is being reshaped by the development of global 
platforms and the acceleration of new technologies and demand from large 
manufacturers. Fitch also believes that the group is well-positioned in some 
fast-growing segments to outperform the overall auto supply market, notably by 
offering products that increase fuel efficiency of its customers' vehicles.

Business Refocus: The Clarion acquisition is in line with our expectations of 
Faurecia refocusing to higher added-value and faster-growing segments and 
accelerating investment in both sustainable mobility and the interior business. 
We expect Faurecia to combine the recently-acquired Parrot and Coagent with 
Clarion to form a new business group of more than EUR1.5 billion in revenue. 
This new segment will accelerate Faurecia's participation in the intelligent 
cockpit business, including stronger positions in human-machine interface, audio 
systems and cloud data management, and provide opportunities to develop 
aftermarket and fleet solutions.

Improving Earnings: Faurecia's operating margin, including restructuring 
expenses, has increased continuously since 2012, to 6.4% in 2017 from 5.7% in 
2016. We expect a further increase to more than 7% by 2020, a level more in line 
with peers' and the rating. All divisions have strengthened their earnings and 
all regions returned to profitability in 2017. The robust order book also 
provides earnings visibility for the next two to three years. The consolidation 
of Clarion will dilute the operating margin in 2019 because of its lower 
profitability than Faurecia's and restructuring and integration costs.

Underlying cash generation has also improved to levels more commensurate with 
the high end of the 'BB' category with the funds from operations (FFO) margin 
set to increase to about 9% by 2020, from 7.9% in 2017 and 7.6% in 2016.

Weak FCF: Free cash flow (FCF) increased to just over EUR220 million in 2017 
(1.3% of value-added sales) from about breakeven in 2015 and 2016. The 
improvement was driven chiefly by more than EUR200 million of working capital 
inflow and higher FFO offsetting increased dividends and capex. We expect the 
FCF margin to decline to 0.5% in 2018 and remain between 0.5% and 1.5% through 
to 2021, as cash generation will be further burdened by integration costs 
related to Clarion. This is at the low end of Fitch's typical requirements for a 
'BB+' rating and leaves limited headroom to the ratings following the increase 
in leverage from the Clarion acquisition. Fitch also believe that FCF remain at 
risk of a working capital reversal in the medium-term and increasing investment 
to meet the group's business refocus and accelerating demand towards shifting 
automotive trends.

Clarion Acquisition to Increase Leverage: Faurecia's FFO adjusted net leverage 
remained stable at 1.6x at end-2017 as positive FCF funded a few small 
acquisitions. However, we expect it to increase to about 2.3x at end-2019 
because of the Clarion acquisition for an enterprise value of about EUR1.2 
billion financed entirely by debt, before gradually declining towards 2x by 
end-2021, a level more commensurate with the rating.

Weak Linkage with PSA: We applied our parent and subsidiary rating linkage (PSL) 
methodology and assessed that Faurecia has a credit profile similar to its 
parent PSA (46.3% stake and 63.1% voting rights). We also deem the legal, 
operational and strategic ties between the two entities weak enough to rate 
Faurecia on a standalone basis.

DERIVATION SUMMARY 

Faurecia's business profile compares adequately with auto suppliers at the 
low-end of the 'BBB' category. The share of the group's aftermarket business, 
which is less volatile and cyclical than sales to original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs), is smaller than tyre manufacturers' such as CGE Michelin 
(A-/Stable) and Continental AG (BBB+/Stable). Faurecia's portfolio has fewer 
products with higher added-value and substantial growth potential than other 
leading and innovative suppliers including Robert Bosch GmbH (F1), Continental 
and Aptiv PLC (BBB/Stable). However, similar to other large and global 
suppliers, it has a broad and diversified exposure to the large international 
auto manufacturers.

With an EBIT margin at around 6.5%, profitability is lower than that of 
investment grade-rated peers, such as Continental, BorgWarner, Inc. 
(BBB+/Stable) and Aptiv. Faurecia's FCF is weak for the ratings and at the 
low-end of Fitch's portfolio of auto suppliers in the 'BB+'/'BBB-' rating 
categories. FFO adjusted net leverage will increase to about 2.3x following the 
Clarion acquisition, a level commensurate with the ratings, but higher than 
investment-grade peers'. Fitch applied its PSL methodology and assessed that 
Faurecia can be rated on a standalone basis. No country-ceiling or operating 
environment aspects impact the ratings.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 

Fitch's Key Assumptions within our Rating Case for the Issuer

- Revenue to increase in mid-single digits p.a. in 2018-2021. Fitch is now 
assessing revenue based on value-added sales, excluding catalytic converter 
monoliths, in line with the group's new reporting method. Monoliths represented 
EUR3.2 billion revenue in 2017

- Clarion to be consolidated into Faurecia's accounts in April 2019

- Operating margin to increase gradually to more than 7% by 2020, including 
restructuring expenses

- Moderate cash outflows from working capital developments in 2019-2021

- Capex to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales after 2018, but increase 
gradually to EUR1.4 billion per year by 2021

- Dividend payout ratio of 25%

- Acquisitions of about EUR1.3 billion in 2019, including Clarion, and EUR250 
million per year in 2020 and 2021

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating 
Action

-  EBIT margin above 8%(2017: 6.4%)

-  FCF margin around 2% (2017: 1.3%)

-  FFO adjusted net leverage below 1.5x (2017: 1.6x)

Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating 
Action

-  EBIT margin below 5%

-  FCF margin below 0.5%

-  FFO adjusted net leverage above 2.5x

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE 

Sound Liquidity: Liquidity is supported by EUR1.2billion of readily available 
cash at end-2017 according to Fitch's adjustments for minimum operational cash 
of about EUR0.4 billion. Total committed and unutilised credit lines maturing in 
June 2023 were EUR1.2 billion, largely covering short-term debt of EUR0.4 
billion at end-2017.

    BEIRUT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Lebanon's risk profile is rising
sharply and some of its central bank tools are becoming less
effective, the World Bank said on Tuesday in its autumn Lebanon
Economic Monitor report. 
    The central bank has in response beefed up its foreign
exchange reserves, lengthened the maturity of deposits and
limited available liquidity, the report said. 
    Almost six months since a parliamentary election, Lebanon's
politicians are yet to agree a unity government that must get to
work on badly needed economic reforms. Politicians have warned
of economic crisis unless a government is formed soon. 
    The country has the world's third largest public debt-to-GDP
ratio, stagnant growth and what the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has said are increasing vulnerabilities in its financial
system.
    Reforms are needed to bring down twin deficits and reduce
reliance on central bank operations which the IMF has described
as unconventional. 
    Debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to continue rising ""in an
unsustainable path"" toward 155 percent by the end of 2018, the
World Bank report said.    
    ""The risk profile for Lebanon is rising sharply in light of
the convergence of a number of negative local and global
factors, including global monetary conditions,"" it said. 
""Fiscal and electricity reforms are highlighted as priorities."" 
   
    The World Bank said it has revised its projection for 2018
real GDP growth downwards to 1 percent from 2 percent. The halt
in central bank subsidized lending is having a significant
impact on the real economy, it said. 
    The formation of a new government and a programme of reforms
would also likely unlock more than $11 billion worth of
infrastructure investment pledged at a donors' meeting in Paris
in April.
    The World Bank report said it saw potential for Lebanon to
""regain the confidence of its people and investors"" after the
parliamentary election in May. It also noted Lebanon would
likely benefit from the reopening of an important border
crossing between neighbours Syria and Jordan this month.    
    Still, hope of a quick government formation and the positive
boost from the Paris donor conference have waned after weeks of
political wrangling, the report said. 
    Attracting enough capital, especially deposits, has been
challenging in light of slower deposit growth. ""There is a
near-complete void of government initiative to address
macroeconomic imbalances,"" the report said. 
    Instead, central bank interventions, even when they succeed,
""offer only temporary reprieve"" and can have macro-financial
risks, it added.

 (Recasts, adds details, Thyssenkrupp comment)
    BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European
Commission has opened a deeper investigation into Thyssenkrupp's
<TKAG.DE> planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel <TISC.NS>
over concerns that it could raise prices and harm competition.
    The so-called Phase II investigation was widely expected and
follows a similar probe into ArcelorMittal's <MT.AS> takeover of
Italy's Ilva, which was cleared only after the group pledged to
sell assets. [nL8N1TV6BY] [nS8N1QI011] [nL8N1WS1BV]
    Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel earlier this year unveiled plans
to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands
and Britain to become the continent's second-largest steelmaker
after ArcelorMittal.
    ""The Commission is concerned that, following the
transaction, customers would face a reduced choice in suppliers,
as well as higher prices,"" the EU executive said in a statement.
    ""These customers include various European companies, ranging
from major corporations to numerous small and medium-size
enterprises,"" it added.
    The Commission identified three areas where the combination
of both companies' specialty flat carbon steel and electrical
steel products could give them a dominant position: steel for
the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and
grain oriented electrical steel.
    Tata Steel's European unit has already put a number of
assets on the block, including Cogent, a manufacturer and
processor of electrical steels, and it is unclear whether these
divestments would satisfy EU concerns. [nFWN1SF0YV]
    The Commission now has 90 working days, until March 19,
2019, to investigate the matter and take a decision.
    A spokeswoman for Thyssenkrupp said that the group would
continue to work closely with the Commission, adding that the
deepened probe was expected and standard for a transaction of
this size.
    The move is nonetheless fuelling expectations that the deal
will require asset disposals to win approval. [nL8N1U02P8]
    Analysts expect few problems regarding crude steel
production, where ratings agency Moody's reckons the venture
will control just 14 percent of the European market, a distant
second to ArcelorMittal's 29 percent, which includes Ilva.
    But the new company, to be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, 
would have a share of about 50 percent of the European packaging
steel, or tinplate, market, a person familiar with the industry
told Reuters.
    Rasselstein, Thyssenkrupp's packaging steel unit, posted
sales of 1.16 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in the 2015/2016
fiscal year and employed about 2,400 workers.
 ($1 = 0.8802 euros)

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Fiat Chrysler’s
<FCHA.MI>, <FCAU.N>  Mike Manley can put his 6 billion euro war
chest to good use. The auto group’s new boss pledged to give
shareholders 2 billion euros from his Magneti Marelli car-parts
sale upon unveiling quarterly results on Tuesday. Manley, named
CEO after Sergio Marchionne’s sudden death in July, could use
the rest to invest, save or do a deal. Bolstering the balance
sheet would please the largest proportion of his stakeholders. 
    The Italian-American group grew adjusted operating profit by
13 percent year-on-year to a record 2 billion euros in the third
quarter, the first with Manley at the helm. This was mostly a
result of strong growth in the NAFTA region, which made up over
90 percent of operating profit. Such heavy dependence on North
American sales is currently a plus, as it insulates the group
from a volatile global trade environment.    
    Coming on board after legendary boss Marchionne, Manley has
big shoes to fill. He has started well enough by demonstrating
some of his boss’s famed dealmaking ability in extracting a
generous price tag for Magneti Marelli. But it’s how Manley
spends the money now that will shape his vision for Fiat
Chrysler in the post-Marchionne era. 
    The CEO has already pledged a third of the cash for special
dividends next year. The rest could be invested to raise
research and development spending to tackle the challenges posed
by electrification and self-driving cars. Or it could be used to
seize deal opportunities, for instance, by expanding into the
car loans business. Fiat Chrysler is alone among big car players
in not owning a so-called captive financial arm, and relies on
partner Santander <SAN.MC>  to handle loans and leases.  
    Yet Manley suggested in an analyst call he might use the
spare cash to boost the 12 billion euros of cash and marketable
securities and 8 billion euros of credit facilities that
constitute the group’s 20 billion euro liquidity position, which
is less than the 25 billion euros held by the automotive
division of Germany’s Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>. Investors did not
like Fiat Chrysler’s so-called net industrial cash – which
excludes net financial services debt - slipping to minus-189
million euros just three months after Marchionne had won a
multi-year battle to turn it positive. Adding some or all of his
4 billion euro cash pile to the mix would be a firm sign of
conservative intent from Manley and put the company on the path
to investment grade.

    By Giulia Segreti
    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Major companies on Tuesday ruled
out involvement in a new rescue of Alitalia, complicating a plan
led by Rome in which state-controlled railway Ferrovie dello
Stato (FS) <IPO-FERRO.MI> will bid for the airline this week and
bring in partners.  
    Alitalia was put under special administration last year, 
leaving the government once again looking to find a buyer to
save the carrier. It will be the airline's third rescue in a
decade.  
    FS is due to present an offer for the whole of Alitalia on
Wednesday subject to a series of conditions. 
    FS's offer would only be a ""transitional phase"", a source
close to the deal told Reuters. 
    The source added the deal would be completed in two separate
steps, with FS picking up Alitalia on set conditions and then,
at a later stage, being joined by an Italian partner and a
international one, from the airline sector. 
    The source added there was very little visibility on next
steps, and it was not clear which partners would join FS.
    ""The situation is very messy,"" the source said. 
    Earlier this month Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio
suggested that state-controlled companies like oil major Eni
<ENI.MI>, postal operator Poste <PST.MI> and defence group
Leonardo <LDOF.MI> could all play a role in the relaunch. 
    Di Maio, also industry minister, said that there were many
private investors also interested in Alitalia. [nS8N1RT01Q] 
    But on Tuesday Eni said that any suggestion that it might
pick up a stake in the carrier was ""groundless"" and that it
would not play a role in the rescue, a spokesperson said.
    Leonardo too will not join any relaunch of Alitalia, which
has already accumulated a loss of over 300 million euros
($340.86 million), a separate source close to the matter told
Reuters.
    ""It would be crazy for Leonardo to enter this madness,"" the
source said. Shares in the group were down almost 1.5 percent at
1600 GMT after Italian dailies had reported that the company
would be involved in an effort spearheaded by FS.   
    Last month Poste Chief Executive Matteo del Fante said the
group was ""not at all interested"" in joining an overhaul effort
for the airline.
    
    CASH DRAIN 
    Alitalia has cost Italian tax payers almost 10 billion euros
over the last 20 years, more than the market capitalisation of
Air France-KLM, Turkish Airlines, Norwegian Air, Finnair and SAS
added together, according to Andrea Giuricin, CEO of transport
advisory firm TRA Consulting. 
    Last year Alitalia accounted for only 8.5 percent of the
international traffic to and from Italy, Giuricin added, just
under a third of Ryanair's share.  
    The sale process was delayed due to the change of Italian
government earlier this year, but the ruling coalition, that
comprises the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the
far-right League, pledged it would close a deal by Wednesday. 
    Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> said earlier on Tuesday that
it had no interest in participating in a government-led
restructuring effort. [nL8N1XA2FU]
    Alitalia must pay back the Italian state almost 1 billion
euros in a bridge loan and related interest by mid-December.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
has said she will not seek re-election as leader of the
centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) at a congress in
December. Merkel, 64, also ruled out running for a fifth term as
chancellor in 2021. [L8N1XA2I3]
    Several CDU politicians have announced bids to succeed
Merkel as party leader. Here are some facts about the candidates
who could step into her shoes:
            
    THE MINI-MERKEL
    Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, was named by Merkel herself
in February as CDU secretary general - a move seen as the first
step in a succession plan.
    Dubbed a ""mini-Merkel"" by German media due to their sober
political styles, Kramp-Karrenbauer was premier of the tiny
state of Saarland on the French border from 2011 to 2018.
    Her Catholic, western German background contrasts with
Merkel's Protestant, eastern roots. While socially conservative
and known for opposing gay marriage, Kramp-Karrenbauer is also a
strong supporter of the minimum wage and workers' rights.
    In an attempt to distance herself from Merkel and her
leadership style, Kramp-Karrenbauer has said the CDU will need
to regain some passion if it wants to attract younger voters.
    Sometimes known as AKK, she is the daughter of a teacher for
mentally handicapped children, and is married to a mining
engineer, with whom she has three children.
    About 19 percent of Germans view Kramp-Karrenbauer as a good
successor for Merkel, according to a poll conducted for Spiegel
Online by the Civey institute. 
           
    THE CRITIC
    Jens Spahn, 38, has become one of Merkel's most outspoken
critics within the CDU since her decision in 2015 to welcome
more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims from war zones in
the Middle East.
    He positions himself as a politician from Germany's rural
northwest who is sceptical of urban liberals and the globalist
elite.
    In an attempt to rein Spahn in, Merkel this year named him
health minister - a thorny portfolio that brings a lot of work
and few headlines.
    A member of the lower house of parliament since 2002, Spahn
has been praised as a rising star for years by senior
conservatives such as former finance minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
    However, his anti-immigration rhetoric at the height of the
refugee crisis cost him sympathy among Merkel allies.
    His public friendship with Richard Grenell, U.S. President
Donald Trump's ambassador to Berlin, has also alienated some
conservatives who dislike Trump's populist style.
    Like Kramp-Karrenbauer, Spahn is a Catholic but, despite the
church's opposition to gay partnerships, he is married to Daniel
Funke, a senior journalist at the glossy magazine Bunte.
    The Civey poll showed Spahn with just six percent support.
        
    THE OUTSIDER
    The most popular candidate, according to polls, is Friedrich
Merz, 62, who was the first to throw his hat into the ring on
Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again as CDU
leader. He confirmed his plans officially on Tuesday.
    Merz, a member of the CDU's conservative wing, has coined
the idea of a German ""Leitkultur"" (lead culture), with which he
called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German
values and traditions.
    Thirty-four percent of Germans view Merz as the best
successor for Merkel, the Civey poll showed.
    He also is known for his proposal to simplify the annual tax
return so that it could be written on a beer mat.
    Merz is among the many conservative men who have seen their
political fortunes dwindle under Merkel.
    In 2002, Merkel pushed him out of his position as CDU
parliamentary leader to cement her grip on the party, on her way
to becoming chancellor in 2005.
    A trained lawyer and ex-member of the European Parliament,
Merz served in the German parliament from 1994-2009, and now
holds numerous non-executive company board positions, including
chairman of the German arm of the U.S. hedge fund BlackRock.
    He is married to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has
three children.

    BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
pledged on Tuesday a new development fund to tackle unemployment
in Africa, a problem spurring the mass migration that has shaped
her long premiership as it nears its end.
    Merkel hosted a summit of African leaders a day after her
announcement that she would retire from politics by 2021, which
sent shockwaves across Europe and started a race to succeed her.
    She needs the Compact with Africa summit to show that
progress has been made in addressing the aftermath of one of the
defining moments of her 13 years in power: her 2015 decision to
open Germany's doors to more than a million asylum seekers.
    The Berlin summit, attended by 12 presidents and prime
ministers including Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, South Africa's
Cyril Ramaphosa, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Rwanda's Paul Kagame,
is designed to showcase the continent as a stable destination
for German investment.
    International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine
Lagarde is also there, along with a host of international
development officials.
    The aim is to create good jobs for Africans, easing the
poverty which, along with political instability and violence,
has encouraged large numbers to head for Europe. But with
Africa's population growing at almost three percent a year, the
task is enormous.
    ""We Europeans have a great interest in African states having
a bright economic outlook,"" Merkel said in her opening speech,
announcing the fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises
from both Europe and Africa to invest on the continent.
    The 119,000 Africans who arrived in Europe in 2018,
according to the International Organisation for Migration, are
the tip of the iceberg. International Labour Organisation
figures show that 16 million migrants were on the move within
Africa in 2014.
    While European Union countries invested $22 billion in
Africa in 2017, breakneck economic growth will be needed to help
bring down the migrant numbers. 
    Berlin hopes Germany's manufacturing-based economy, which
drove Eastern Europe's rapid economic growth after the 1989
collapse of Communism, could turn things round.
    Merkel needs results fast if she is to ensure the leadership
of her Christian Democrats passes to a centrist ally, such as
its general secretary, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
    
    A MARSHALL PLAN FOR AFRICA?
    Other candidates for the party leadership, including Health
Minister Jens Spahn or her old rival, the strongly pro-business
Friedrich Merz, are well to her right politically and could be
expected to want to challenge much of her legacy.
    Merkel has said she will remain chancellor but that her
current, fourth term up to 2021 will be her last. A whopping 71
percent of Germans welcomed Merkel's decision, a poll released
Tuesday by broadcasters RTL and n-tv showed.  
    Germany has introduced tax incentives for its companies to
set up plants in Africa, reflecting her view that state aid must
give way to private investment if jobs are to be created in
their millions. 
    This would be part of a ""Marshall Plan for Africa"" - named
after the U.S.-funded plan that helped to rebuild European
states including Germany after World War Two - that she sees as
central to her legacy.
    Merkel presented her decision to open Germany's borders in
2015 as an unavoidable necessity driven by the vast scale of the
human tide, that year mostly fleeing the civil war in Syria.
    An agreement with Turkey sharply curtailed the arrival of
refugees into the EU through Greece. But hundreds of thousands
of mainly African migrants continued to travel across the
Mediterranean, a flow that finally began to abate in the past
year with improved efforts to halt smuggling from Libya. 
    The crisis has upturned European politics, bringing the far
right to power in Italy and Austria, and in Germany revitalising
the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose demand that the
country shut its borders to migrants helped to fuel its surge
into parliament in last year's election.
    A successful outcome to the summit may help to strengthen
Merkel's case for remaining chancellor even after stepping down
from the party leadership, and could quieten her coalition
partners in Bavaria's conservative CSU and the Social Democrats
(SPD).
    All three parties have suffered punishing setbacks in
regional elections this month, building internal party pressure
for them to switch leaders or break up the coalition.

    LISBON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament approved
the Socialist government's 2019 budget bill on Tuesday, setting
the scene to nearly eliminate the deficit amid projected healthy
economic growth and with more income for families.
    Portugal, which only emerged from a debt crisis in 2014, has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with policies  to support
strong growth under the centre-left administration, while
reversing many unpopular austerity measures during a bailout.
    Its example, often lauded by Brussels, is in sharp contrast 
to Italy's plans to widen the budget deficit in 2019. The plans,
opposed by the European Commission, have unnerved investors,
causing Italy's bond yields to rise well past Portuguese ones.
    Finance Minister Mario Centeno said it was precisely
Portugal's fiscal performance in line with EU budget
requirements that had helped slash its financing costs, allowing
to use the saved money for what he called ""an enormous relief of
the tax burden"", while also narrowing the budget gap.
    Government allies in parliament - the Communist Party and
Left Bloc, who along with the Socialists hold 122 seats in the
230-seat house, voted for the bill.
    The centre-right opposition Social Democrats and
conservative CDS-PP voted against, criticising the bill as an
election year gimmick while pointing to a slowing growth they
say will ultimately undermine the budget consolidation.

    By Andrei Khalip
    LISBON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament approved
the Socialist government's 2019 budget bill on Tuesday, setting
the scene to nearly eliminate the deficit amid projected healthy
economic growth and with more income for families.
    Portugal, which only emerged from a debt crisis in 2014, has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with policies to support
strong growth under the centre-left administration, while
reversing many unpopular austerity measures during a bailout.
    Its example, often lauded by Brussels, is in sharp contrast 
to Italy's plans to widen the budget deficit in 2019. The plans,
opposed by the European Commission, have unnerved investors,
causing Italy's bond yields to rise well past Portuguese ones.
    ""This is a budget that will help reinforce confidence, and
it is possible thanks to the political stability maintained over
these three years,"" Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters,
referring to his party's alliance in parliament with two hard
left parties - the Communist Party and Left Bloc - whose votes
were crucial to pass the bill.
    The centre-right opposition Social Democrats and
conservative CDS-PP voted against, criticising the bill as an
election year gimmick while pointing to slowing growth they say
will ultimately undermine budget consolidation.
    The government forecasts growth to remain above 2 percent
per year until at least 2022 and expects to reach a budget
surplus by 2020, which should allow to significantly cut
Portugal's debt burden - still the euro zone's third-largest.
    ""We are on a path of growth, job creation, of recovering
international credibility,"" Costa said.
    Earlier, data showed unemployment last month fell to its
lowest level since at least 2002, at 6.6 percent. The budget
bill forecasts the jobless rate to fall slightly more, to 6.3
percent, by the end of next year.
    Finance Minister Mario Centeno said it was Portugal's fiscal
performance in line with EU budget requirements that had helped
slash its financing costs, allowing it to use the saved money
for what he called ""an enormous relief of the tax burden"", while
also narrowing the budget gap.
    Portuguese will pay 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) less in
income tax next year than in 2015, the year the government came
to power, he said.
    The document promises to deliver a deficit of just 0.2
percent of gross domestic product after this year's estimated
0.7 percent, while raising pensions, giving civil servants
higher pay, alleviating families' transport costs and investing
more in healthcare.[nL8N1WV73K]
    It projects economic growth of 2.2 percent, a touch lower
than this year's 2.3 percent. Last year, Portugal's economy grew
2.8 percent - its strongest pace since 2000.  
    The Socialists lead in opinion polls by a wide margin for a
national election due in a year's time, although the surveys
show they are just short of a parliamentary majority which means
they will probably have to maintain an alliance on the left.
    The bill will now be discussed in parliament committees
before the final vote due on Nov. 29. The government's allies
have said they will try to improve public funding of healthcare
and education.
