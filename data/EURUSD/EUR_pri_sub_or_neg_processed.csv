    BRATISLAVA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A Slovak court on Sunday
ordered four people jailed until their trial for the murder of
investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, a state
prosecutor said.
    The February killings sparked nationwide protests that
toppled the government of Robert Fico, who had run Slovakia for
all but two of the past 12 years.
    Three suspects were detained in a house raid on Thursday
morning and charged with murder on Friday. [nL8N1WD2F0]  
    The fourth suspect, a woman detained separately on Friday,
has been charged with participating in the murder, which may
have included helping, planning, ordering or organising the
killing, Kuciak family's lawyer Daniel Lipsic told Reuters.  
    Authorities released no further details on the four suspects
and it is not yet clear when the trial might take place.
    Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud involving
businessmen with Slovak political ties, and the suspected mafia
links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia. [nL8N1W33GJ]
    A prosecutor said this month the February murder was likely
a contract killing related to Kuciak's work.
    His final story, published posthumously, reported on an
Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two
Slovaks who later worked in the office of then-prime minister
Fico.
    Both of the Slovaks resigned, but deny connections to the
murder. Their Italian former business partner has also denied
having connections with the mafia and the murder, but was
detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and
extradited to Italy in May. [nL8N1RX38P]
    Weeks of public protests in March eventually forced the
departure of the long-serving Fico but his three-party coalition
has remained in power under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, who
comes from the Smer party, which Fico still heads.

    By William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Foreign minister
Jeremy Hunt told the European Union on Sunday that punishing
Britain in Brexit talks would fuel the desire of other states to
break away, in a speech aimed at uniting Prime Minister Theresa
May's Conservative Party against Brussels.
    Hunt's address to the party's annual conference in
Birmingham was immediately seen by members and media as a claim
to be considered a candidate to replace May if her leadership
falters over a seemingly intractable Brexit process.
    Seeking to unify a party still split between those who
wanted to stay in the EU and those who wanted to leave, he cast
Brussels as the villain in stalled and acrimonious negotiations
over a future partnership.  
    ""At the moment you seem to think the way to keep the club
together is to punish a member who leaves,"" he said at the
governing Conservative Party's annual conference in Birmingham.
    ""The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club
into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish, it will
grow, and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to
escape.""
    Hunt, 51, replaced Boris Johnson as foreign minister in July
after Johnson resigned in protest against May's Brexit plans.
    Johnson was the face of the 2016 pro-Brexit campaign and has
since set out his own vision of Brexit, labelling May's plan
'deranged' and seeking to sweep up the support of the majority
of Conservative members who also wanted to leave the EU.    
    Hunt took a different approach on Sunday, making an appeal
to the 48 percent of Britons who voted to remain in the EU,
while adopting a bellicose tone with Brussels and against the
opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
    ""If we are to unite the country, we must deliver not just a
true Brexit for the 52 percent (of 'Leave' voters) - but also a
generous Brexit for the 48 percent. They are patriots too,"" he
said . ""So however fierce the debate, however high the passions,
never forget that disunity and division won’t give us a better
Brexit but the wrong Brexit, a Corbyn Brexit or perhaps no
Brexit at all.""

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The standoff between Rome and
Brussels is set to get worse, with the European Commission
expected to formally reject Italy's budget plans in November,
the Italian daily La Repubblica reports. It cited sources saying
the European Union would have little choice given the plan by
the 5-Star Movement and League to push the 2019 deficit up to
2.4 percent of GDP, despite the existing debt overload standing
at over 130 percent of output. Brussels still has time to
consider what its reaction will be. Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria, who sought in vain to persuade the government to ease off
its spending plans, will meet his eurozone peers in Luxembourg
for a regular meeting later today; he was out at the weekend
arguing that better economic growth would eventually help Italy
bring its debt ratio down.
    There was a blizzard of words on Brexit over the weekend as
the ruling Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham began.
Not many of them have added much, but some may contribute to the
worsening mood post-Salzburg - with Foreign Secretary Jeremy
Hunt, for example, likening the EU to a harsh prison from which
other inmates may be tempted to escape. The more placatory
Finance Minister Philip Hammond has just come out and said he
spots a clear willingness in Brussels to do a deal. 
    If there was a strategic benefit to the EU and NATO in
seeing the Greek-Macedonia dispute on its southern flank
settled, that goal suffered a setback at the weekend. Turnout in
Macedonia's crucial name-change referendum was so weak that it
will not be valid. No matter that 90 percent of those who voted
were in favour of the amendment: a boycott call by opponents
plus a poorly handled pro-change campaign meant just 36 percent
of voters bothered to turn up. Macedonia's PM vowed to press on
to solve the row with Greece but Skopje's ambitions to join the
EU and NATO could now be further complicated.
        
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT     
Optimism about a reconstituted NAFTA and what it means for trade
compromises more broadly have helped world markets kick off the
fourth quarter with a relatively positive spin - even without
Chinese markets, which were out for public holidays. S&P500
stock futures,  Japan’s Nikkei and Canada’s dollar all advanced
about 0.5 percent after the United States and Canada on Sunday
forged a deal to keep a trilateral trade agreement between the
two countries and Mexico alive – and now to be call the United
States Mexico Canada Agreement. Mexico’s peso outperformed and
gained 0.8 percent, while the Nikkei's rise took it to a 27-year
high as the yen weakened to its lowest level against the dollar
in almost a year. The rest of Asia's emerging markets did less
well, with the South Korean and Indonesian main equity
benchmarks in the red on Monday as weekend Chinese business
surveys underwhelmed again. 
    Italy’s contentious budget proposals are also likely to rein
in the mood in Europe later as Italian Finance Minister Tria
heads to Luxembourg to meet his euro group peers after
announcing late Thursday a higher-than-expected 2.4 percent
budget deficit target for next year. While the details of the
budget are still unclear and need to be thrashed out in
parliament over the coming weeks, the 2.4 percent figure
exceeded the 2 percent level Tria has previously indicated was a
ceiling if the country’s debt was to be kept sustainable over
time. While the single-year deficit figure will still mean Italy
runs a primary surplus in excess of 1 percent, keeps its
debt/GDP ratio little changed for the year and mean less than 10
billion euros in net new bond sales, the political ramifications
of a row with Brussels have kept markets on edge. Short-dated
Italian government bond yields extended Friday’s surge and rose
more than 10 basis points first thing on Monday. Tria on Sunday
insisted the debt/GDP ratio would fall by one percentage point a
year over the next three years as growth picks up and that debt
reduction would be guaranteed by a mechanism that automatically
cuts spending if growth falls short. He also said the budget was
""absolutely not a challenge to Europe"". Details are unclear over
how much the increased deficit would involve handouts to poor
Italians, demanded by 5 Star leader Di Maio, and how much would
be investment spending.  
    Euro/dollar was down a touch in early trading, below $1.16
but still off Friday’s lows. European stocks were flat after
heavy losses for Italian and euro zone banks on the budget deal
on Friday. The dollar was higher more broadly, with emerging
-market currencies and equities lower. U.S. Treasury yields were
higher on the trade news and the yield curve steepened a touch.
Brent crude oil added to their recent gains and pushed to a
four-year high above $83 per barrel. Sterling was mixed as
traders kept an eye on this week’s annual conference of the
ruling Conservative Party as it tries to heal rifts over the
government’s negotiating stance over Brexit.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> on
Monday appointed Jesper Nielsen, a member of its executive board
and head of its Danish banking business, as interim chief
executive after Thomas Borgen said he would quit amid a money
laundering scandal.
    Borgen said he would resign after an internal inquiry found
that 200 billion euros ($235 billion) of payments, many of which
Danske Bank said were suspicious, had been moved through its
Estonian branch over a period of eight years. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Denmark's largest bank said Borgen has been relieved of his
duties, while Nielsen will continue to work as Head of Banking
DK and is not a candidate for the permanent CEO position.
    ""We are of the opinion that, with the situation the bank is
in, it is best that the executive director is also part of the
bank's future,"" chairman of the bank Ole Andersen said in a
statement emailed to Reuters.
    He added that finding a new CEO was progressing as planned,
but a spokesman for the bank declined to estimate when a new CEO
could be announced, or whether the appointment of an interim CEO
meant that the board has widened the search for a new CEO.
    The head of Danske's Wealth Management unit Jacob
Aarup-Andersen has been named by some analysts and media
including Danish online media Finans as a likely new CEO for the
bank, although some say that at the age of 40 he is still too
inexperienced for the top job.
    Others who have been mentioned by analysts and media as
possible candidates are the CEO of Danish mortgage lender
Nykredit, Michael Rasmussen, the Head of European Fixed Income
and Commodities at Morgan Stanley <MS.N> Jakob Horder, and
Annika Falkengren who is the former CEO of Swedish bank SEB
<SEBa.ST> and a partner in Swiss bank Lombard Odier.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italian bond yields rose sharply
on Monday, extending last week's move, as a news report
suggested Italy's budget proposal was set to be rejected by the
European Commission.
    Italian daily La Repubblica reported on Monday that the
Commission was set to reject Italy's budget plans in November
and open a procedure against its public accounts in
February.[nR1N1VZ00C]
    Italy's two-year government bond yield surged 18 basis
points to 1.23 percent, before receding to 1.19 percent, while
the yield on its longer 10-year government bond was up nine
basis points at 3.24 percent. <IT2YT=RR>, <IT10YT=RR>.
    The premium investors demand for holding Italian debt over
top-rated German bonds was 274 basis points on Monday, having
been as tight as 225 basis points last week <DE10IT10YT=RR>. 
    ""It's hard to envisage spreads moving back towards the low
end of the range in coming months,"" wrote ING analysts in a note
on Monday. 
    The report comes after a fraught week for investors in
Italian debt. 
    Italian government bond yields and banking stocks were hit
hard on Friday after Italy's ruling parties -- the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League --
proposed a budget for 2019 with a budget deficit target of 2.4
percent of gross domestic product. 
    ""It is quite clear that the European Commission will not
like (the budget proposal),"" said Commerzbank rates strategist
Michael Leister. 
    ""Brussels will give its opinion which we think won’t be
positive and ... the ratings agencies will opt for a similar
stance. A downgrade is our base case.""
    Tria moved to temper concerns that Italy's enormous debt
pile - 131 percent of GDP - would continue to grow, saying on
Sunday investments would fuel economic growth over the next two
years and put debt on a downward path. [nL8N1WG0GW]
    Elsewhere, euro zone bond yields were one to two basis
points higher, as a last-gasp deal between the United States and
Canada on Sunday to salvage the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) pushed investors to riskier assets

auction of the year on Nov. 8 and, subject to market conditions,
issue its first ""green bond"" during the final quarter, the

    Ireland's debt agency has so far raised 13.5 billion euros

debt this year.
    The NTMA said last month it would hold a roadshow for
investors in the coming weeks to explain the green bonds, which
raise money for projects with environmental benefits. The bond
will be sold via a syndication of banks, it said.

    The lowest rate was 3.4 percent in Germany, unchanged from
July. The rate in France increased to 9.3 in August from 9.2
percent in July.
    Overall, 13.22 million people were without a job in the euro
zone, a decline of 102,000 from July.
    In the whole of the European Union, 16.66 million people
were unemployed, for an unchanged rate of 6.8 percent.

    ROME, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to
reject Italy's budget plans in November and open a procedure
against the country's public accounts in February, Italian daily
la Repubblica reported on Monday.
    Last week, the ruling coalition, which comprises the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League,
proposed a 2019 deficit that is, at 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), three times the previous
administration's target. [nL8N1WE1PY]
    Citing unnamed EU sources, the newspaper said Brussels had
little room for manoeuvre with such targets, adding that the
Commission would be forced to reject the budget.
    Officials and diplomats in Brussels told Reuters last week
that they still hope market forces will convince Italy to change
its budgetary plans before they are formally submitted by
mid-October to the EU Commission. [nL8N1WE5VV]
    It is still far from certain whether the EU executive would
choose to enter the uncharted territory of sending the budget
back to Rome -- a move that would escalate the crisis if Italy
were to ignore its recommendations, sources said.
    In that case, the Commission would have to open sanctions
proceedings against Rome, but that might not happen before
spring because disciplinary decisions are usually taken only
after final data is available in April.

    By Teis Jensen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>
appointed an interim chief executive on Monday as it sought to
reassure investors rattled by a $235 billion money laundering
scandal and looking for a new leader.
    Jesper Nielsen, the head of Danske Bank's domestic banking
business, will take on the running of the bank while a
replacement is found for Thomas Borgen, who resigned last month
but was not originally going to leave with immediate effect.
    ""The bank cannot move on with rebuilding the trust in the
bank before he (Borgen) is gone,"" said Jens Munch Holst, chief
executive of MP Pension, which holds Danske Bank shares, said.
    Borgen quit after an internal inquiry found that payments
totalling 200 billion euros, many of which Danske Bank said were
suspicious, had been moved through its Estonian branch between
2007 and 2015. [nL8N1W51FB]
    ""I agree with the board that it is best for all parties that
the chief executive is someone who can help follow decisions
through to the end, and as I have resigned, that is not me,"" the
54-year-old said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  
    Borgen, who was in charge of Danske Bank's international
operations, including Estonia, between 2009 and 2012 and became
CEO in 2013, said last month that while he was cleared from a
legal point of view, he held ""ultimate responsibility"".
    Denmark's largest bank said Borgen has been relieved of his
duties, while Nielsen will continue to work as Head of Banking
DK and is not a candidate for the permanent CEO position.
    ""We are of the opinion that, with the situation the bank is
in, it is best that the executive director is also part of the
bank's future,"" chairman of the bank Ole Andersen said.
    He added that finding a new CEO was progressing as planned,
but a spokesman for the bank declined to estimate when a new CEO
could be announced, or whether the appointment of an interim CEO
meant that the board has widened the search for a new CEO.
    British shareholder adviser Hermes EOS has urged the bank's
board to explore suing senior executives over the money
laundering scandal, the Financial Times reported on Monday.
    Hermes EOS said it wanted the bank to emulate German
engineering conglomerate Siemens <SIEGn.DE>, which sued several
senior managers, including former chief executives and chairmen,
over a large bribery scandal, the newspaper reported.
    Hermes EOS did not respond to requests for comment.
    Denmark's MP Pension said it will hold a meeting with Danske
Bank this week and will ask ""a series of critical questions to
make sure the bank is doing what it can to clean up to ensure
that a money laundering case will never happen again"".
    In another top level departure, Danske Bank said its chief
legal adviser had also resigned.
    ""I have taken part in many of Danske Bank’s key cases in the
past five years, and I feel it is time to move on in my career,""
Group General Counsel Flemming Pristed said.
    ""The recent Estonia case in particular has been very
demanding, and it is a good time for me to stop now that a new
CEO is to be appointed and the findings of the bank’s internal
investigations into the matters at the Estonian branch have been
announced,"" Pristed said in a statement.
 
    NAMES IN FRAME
    Danske Bank has not named any potential permanent
replacements for Borgen, but the head of its Wealth Management
unit Jacob Aarup-Andersen has been named by some analysts and
media including Danish online media Finans as a likely new CEO,
although some say that at 40 he is too inexperienced.
    Aarup-Andersen took up his role in April following a
two-and-a-half year stint as Danske's CFO, and before that two
years as CEO of its pension fund Danica. [nL5N1RJ14A]
    After having obtained a master's degree in Economy at
University of Copenhagen in 2002 Aarup-Andersen worked in
London's financial district for amongst others Goldman Sachs for
ten years before he returned to Denmark for a job as Chief
Portfolio Manager at Danske's Capital unit in 2012.
    Others mentioned by analysts and media outlets as possible
candidates are the CEO of Danish mortgage lender Nykredit,
Michael Rasmussen, the Head of European Fixed Income and
Commodities at Morgan Stanley <MS.N> Jakob Horder, and Annika
Falkengren who is the former CEO of Swedish bank SEB <SEBa.ST>
and a partner in Swiss bank Lombard Odier.
    Morgan Stanley and Nykredit declined to comment, while
Lombard Odier did not immediately respond.

    ROME, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to
reject Italy's budget plans in November and open a procedure
against the country's public accounts in February, Italian daily
la Repubblica reported on Monday.
    Last week, the ruling coalition, which comprises the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League,
proposed a 2019 deficit that is, at 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), three times the previous
administration's target. [nL8N1WE1PY]
    Citing unnamed EU sources, the newspaper said Brussels had
little room for manoeuvre with such targets, adding that the
Commission would be forced to reject the budget.
    The European Commission did not immediately respond to a
request for comment on Monday.
    Last week the EU executive body said that it will assess the
draft budgetary plans for 2019 of all euro area member states,
including Italy, in the weeks after their formal presentation by
15 October, and before the end of November.
    Officials and diplomats in Brussels told Reuters last week
that they still hope market forces will convince Italy to change
its budgetary plans before they are formally submitted by
mid-October to the EU Commission. [nL8N1WE5VV]
    It is still far from certain whether the EU executive would
choose to enter the uncharted territory of sending the budget
back to Rome -- a move that would escalate the crisis if Italy
were to ignore its recommendations, sources said.
    In that case, the Commission would have to open sanctions
proceedings against Rome, but that might not happen before
spring because disciplinary decisions are usually taken only
after final data is available in April.

increase in its budget deficit risks sparking a clash with the
European Union.
    Its eurosceptic government has targeted a budget deficit of
2.4 percent of GDP for the next three years, which would imply
no debt reduction, violating an EU requirement to cut it.
    The European Union's excessive deficit procedure is
triggered if a country has breached or risks breaching the
deficit threshold of 3 percent of GDP or has a debt of over 60
percent of GDP that is not falling at a satisfactory pace.
    Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio was 133.4 percent at the end of
the first quarter of 2018, according to EU statistics office
Eurostat, the second highest level in the EU after bailed-out
Greece.

    BUDGET PLANS DUE BY OCTOBER 15
    As part of the EU's ""European Semester"" policy coordination
process, the European Commission makes an annual assessment of
draft budgetary plans for the forthcoming years in October and
November.
    The plans of all 19 euro zone countries, including Italy are
due to be presented to the Commission by October.
    The Commission has three options:
    1. It can give a positive response
    2. It can call for revisions from a government
    3. It can reject a budgetary plan. So far, this option has
never been taken.
    
    SANCTIONS BY SPRING?
    If the Commission did reject Italy's budget, Rome would be
required to change its plans. 
    But if Italy then refused to do so, the Commission would
have to open sanctions proceedings against Rome.
    That might not happen before spring because disciplinary
decisions are usually taken only after final data is available
in April. 
    A disciplinary procedure can end in fines for non-complying
countries.
    However, Rome is aware that France escaped sanctions despite
being the subject of EU deficit proceedings for nine years. The
Commission also spared Spain and Portugal fines in 2016 despite
their excessive deficits.
    Indeed, no country has ever been fined under these sanction
proceedings.

confederation SAK threatened on Monday to extend its protest
beyond a previously announced one-day strike this week over a
government plan that would make it easier for small companies to
dismiss workers.
    Five unions called last week for more than 30,000 of their
members to go on strike on Oct. 3 to protest against what they
see as attacks on workers' rights. [nL8N1WE6CG]
    ""SAK's unions are prepared to extend their actions, assuming
the government will continue to prepare its detrimental law on
lay-offs,"" it warned in a statement.
    The planned one-day strike threatens to wipe an estimated 50
million euros ($58 million) off the gross domestic product,
according to the Confederation of Finnish Industries.
    With more than 900,000 members through its 18 affiliated
unions, SAK is highly influential among the Nordic euro zone
nation of mere 5.5 million inhabitants.
    Unions have been angered by the centre-right government's
decision to ignore a national tradition of letting them
participate in negotiating changes to labour legislation.  
    The government, led by Prime Minister Juha Sipila, hopes the
changes will end up creating more jobs as they will make small
companies more willing to hire.
    The government said it would present changes to the proposed
law, but SAK rejected any such amendments.
    ""The protests due to begin on Wednesday... will be cancelled
only if the government abandons any preparations for the law on
lay-offs,"" it said.

agreement, Britain's trade minister Liam Fox said on Monday.
    ""If we got no agreement with the European Union that would
be very harmful to European trade too. European businesses would
have to pay tariffs to access the UK's market, possibly to the
tune of as much as 14 billion pounds a year,"" Fox told BBC TV.
    ""That is quite a big business tax to apply to European
businesses. It is everyone's interest that we reach an agreement
and do it as quickly as possible.""

    By Massimiliano Di Giorgio
    ROME, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio
on Monday accused European Union officials of ""terrorism"" by
deliberately upsetting financial markets with negative comments
about Italy's budget plans.
    Italian bond yields have risen sharply since Rome last week
presented a budget targeting a fiscal deficit for next year at
2.4 percent of gross domestic product, three times the previous
goal.
    The government projected the same deficit level for the
following two years, flouting EU demands that the fiscal gap
should progressively fall towards zero.
    ""Some European institutions are playing ... at creating
terrorism on the markets,"" said Di Maio, who is the head of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
    Speaking to reporters in Rome, he specifically took aim at
European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, who
earlier said in Luxembourg that Rome's plans were ""obviously""
deviating from EU rules on fiscal discipline.
    ""Some people weren't happy to see the spread (between
Italian benchmark bond yields and the German equivalent) hadn't
risen this morning, so Moscovici decided to make a declaration
against the budget to upset the markets,"" Di Maio said.
    Moscovici said at a meeting of eurogroup finance ministers
that although Italy's plans were not in line with the rules, he
nonetheless wanted to maintain a dialogue with the Rome
government that took office in June. [nS8N1VJ00S]
    European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis later
also said that an initial assessment suggested Italy's budget
breached EU rules. 
    Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement
which governs with the right-wing League, defended the 2.4
percent deficit target, pointing out that it was broadly in line
with the deficits Italy has run in the last five years.
    ""It's no different from that of the previous governments,
but if 5-Star and the League do it, we are bad and ugly, if the
others do it they are statesmen,"" he said.
    Di Maio said if any ratings agencies should downgrade
Italy's sovereign debt over the budget plan ""it would mean there
is a prejudice against this government"".
    The agencies have been waiting for Rome's fiscal plans
before reconsidering their ratings and Moody's, which has a
negative outlook on Italy's Baa2 rating, said it would pass
judgment by the end of October.
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria will leave the Luxembourg
meeting early, returning to Rome later on Monday to work on the
details of the budget, skipping the meetings planned for
Tuesday, his ministry said earlier in the day.  
    Di Maio said there was ""no emergency"" connected with the
minister's return to Rome, and also ""no reason to question"" the
2.4 percent deficit target.
    He added that he would be holding further meetings on the
budget in the next few days with Tria, Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte, Deputy Prime Minister and League Leader Matteo Salvini
and Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero.

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Top euro zone officials
expressed concern on Monday over Italy's 2019 draft budget that
could increase the country's debt, and signalled they expected
changes in the coming weeks.
    Italy's eurosceptic government proposed on Thursday a budget
that increases the deficit to 2.4 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) next year, tripling it in comparison with the
plans of its predecessors. 
    European Commission Vice President for the euro Valdis
Dombrovskis said on entering a meeting of euro zone finance
ministers that Italy's draft budget was clearly breaking EU
rules, while Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the
draft was ""not reassuring"".
    Under EU law Italy should reduce its public debt rather than
increase borrowing. Rome has a debt of 133 percent of GDP, the
second highest in the euro zone as a share of economic output
after bailed-out Greece. Markets reacted to the budget plans by
selling Italian debt.
    Italy has to formally submit its draft 2019 budget to the
Commission for scrutiny by Oct 15. The Commission would have up
to a week to announce if it has found the budget in clear breach
of EU rules, and another week after that to demand a new draft.
    Such a rejection has never taken place since the Commission
was granted the power to vet draft budgets in 2013. 
    The EU executive has dealt in previous years with budgets
breaking EU rules from France, Spain, Portugal and Italy itself.
It has always opted to enter some form of negotiation with the
government concerned, branding the draft as ""at risk of
non-compliance"" or ""at serious risk of non-compliance"". 
    But officials indicated it might be different now. 
    ""Never were rules broken so bluntly, without the slightest
grain of elegance,"" one senior official said.
    Yet, Hoekstra noted the drafting of the 2019 budget was not
over and things could still change in coming weeks, especially
until Rome submits the draft to the Commission on Oct 15.
    European Commission Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said that while rules had to be
respected, he was keen to maintain dialogue with Rome -- code
for negotiations that would be face-saving for both sides.
    The chairman of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno
expressed a similar view.
    ""We know that there are still negotiations going on in Rome,
and we have to wait for that to happen and have our answers at
the end of the process,"" Centeno told reporters on arrival.
    The higher spending that Itay seeks is meant to finance the
campaign promises of the ruling parties - the anti-establishment
5-Star Movement and right-wing League - to lower the retirement
age, cut taxes, invest in infrastructure and boost welfare.
    French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Italy's euro
zone peers would be gradually applying pressure on Rome.
    ""I think we have to go step by step,"" he told reporters
before the meeting. He said respecting EU rules was even more
important now that the European Union was facing a serious
threat from rising ""populist and nationalist movements"".
    ""What is a stake now is clearly the future of Europe,"" he
said, urging euro zone states to respect common rules and to
quickly agree on a reform of the euro zone, because the bloc was
not fit to face a new major financial crisis.

    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Italy's finance minister told
his euro zone peers during a closed-door meeting in Luxembourg
on Monday that details of Italy's budgetary plans for 2019 were
still under discussion within the government, two European Union
sources told Reuters.
    Giovanni Tria was asked to explain Rome's plans for a large

ministers, the source said, although the topic was not on the
agenda of the monthly Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance

    He explained the government's plans but said they were not
final yet and details were still under discussion, the sources
said.
    A third source confirmed French Finance Minister Bruno Le
Maire had asked Tria for details of the plans, backed by his
Dutch counterpart Wopke Hoekstra.
    Tria said the government's priorities were investment and
growth, according to two sources. 
    He insisted Italy's debt would decrease, repeating comments
he made to reporters before the meeting.
    Last week, the government agreed its budgetary plans for the
next three years, which will be the basis for the 2019 draft
budget that will have to be submitted to the EU Commission by
mid-October.
    The first EU source said that at Monday's meeting, the EU
Economy Commissioner said the Commission was concerned by
Italy's plans for a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2019, three
times higher than earlier commitments.
    But he added it was too early to formulate the commission's
position on the budget, as it had not been submitted yet.     
    The second source said the head of the Eurogroup, Portugal's
Finance Minister Mario Centeno, raised doubts about the deficit
targets and said it was Italy's responsibility to demonstrate
its fiscal objectives were sustainable.

 (Recasts with euro, updates prices)
    By Karen Brettell
    NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the greenback on Monday on renewed concerns about
Italy’s budget, while the Canadian dollar gained after the United States and Canada reached a last-minute
deal on Sunday to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio accused European Union officials of deliberately upsetting
financial markets with negative comments about Italy's budget plans.
    He was taking aim at European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, who earlier said that
Rome's plans were ""obviously"" deviating from EU rules on fiscal discipline. [nL8N1WH5HG]
    The deal between the United States and Canada, meanwhile, keeps intact a three-country, $1.2 trillion
open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century. [nL2N1WG084]
    ""It’s headline driven trading still for many markets and it’s probably going to remain the focus for
traders in the short run,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
    The euro was last down 0.27 percent against the greenback <EUR=> at $1.1577.
    The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in Italy’s budget will
exacerbate the country’s already high debt levels. [nL8N1WH0YA]
    Italian daily La Repubblica reported on Monday that the European Commission was set to reject Italy's
plans to lift its budget deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019. [nR1N1VZ00C]
    The proposed deficit is three times the previous administration's target. [nL8N1WD1W3]
    The U.S. dollar dropped 0.94 percent against the loonie <CAD=> to $1.2783.
    The new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which avoids tariffs, will make it harder for
global auto makers to build cars cheaply in Mexico and is aimed at bringing more jobs to the United
States. [nL2N1WG084]
    ""The good news is that the risk of bad news has been removed. I don’t think there’s anything here that
really changes the medium term outlook for the Canadian dollar or the Canadian economy. It's just removed
an uncertainty,"" said Osborne.

    By Francesco Guarascio and Jan Strupczewski
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Top euro zone officials warned
Italy on Monday its plan to borrow billions of extra euros to
fund spending pledges could tip the bloc back into crisis,
vowing to pressure Rome to change course. 
    Italy new eurosceptic government proposed on Thursday a
budget that increases the deficit to 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2019, tripling it in comparison with the
plans of its predecessors. 
    Markets reacted by dumping Italian debt, the second highest
in the euro zone as a share of economic output after bailed-out
Greece, as concerns spread about a renewed sovereign debt
crisis, just three years after the Greek troubles nearly
destroyed the single currency.
    In a speech in Germany, European Commission head Jean-Claude
Juncker said that with its draft, Italy was moving away from the
budgetary targets agreed at EU level and warned that if others
were to get Italy's treatment, it could spell the end of the
euro.
    ""I would not wish that, after having really been able to
cope with the Greek crisis, we'll end up in the same crisis in
Italy,"" Juncker said [nB5N1O400K].
    Reacting to Juncker's remarks, the Italian Finance Minister
Giovanni Tria said later on Monday that he did not expect the
end of the euro. 
    Italy's government wants higher public spending to finance
campaign promises made by its ruling parties - the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League - to
lower the retirement age, cut taxes, invest in infrastructure
and boost welfare.
    The country has already benefited from lenient fiscal
treatment from the Commission for years, using various options
to achieve higher spending.
    
    TRIA QUESTIONED
    In a sign of concern over Italy, Dutch Finance Minister
Wopke Hoekstra and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire asked
Tria to explain the draft at a meeting of euro zone finance
ministers in Luxembourg, even though it was not on the agenda
[nL8N1WH5I2].
    ""Recent announcements by the Italian government have raised
concerns over its budgetary course, concerns that need to be
addressed soon,"" the chairman of euro zone finance ministers
Mario Centeno told a news conference after the meeting.
    ""We are all bound by the euro and we need sound policies to
protect it. It is up to the Italian government to show it has a
sustainable and credible budgetary plan,"" Centeno said.
    Officials said Tria opened the door to changes by telling
the ministers that details of the draft were not final yet. He
also assured them that Italy's debt would be on a downward path.
    However, when he left the meeting Tria declined to answer
reporters' questions about the possibility of changing Italy's
deficit targets and stressed other EU countries had in the past
breached EU fiscal rules [nL8N1WH6JP]. 
    Under EU law Italy should reduce its public debt rather than
increase borrowing. Rome's total debt is worth 133 percent of
GDP. 
    Italy has to formally submit its draft 2019 budget to the
Commission for scrutiny by Oct 15. The Commission would have up
to a week to announce if it has found the budget in clear breach
of EU rules, and another week after that to demand a new draft.
    Such a rejection has never taken place since the Commission
was granted the power to vet draft budgets in 2013. 
    
    SOFT PRESSURE
    ""We will try to convince the Italian authorities to revert
to the medium-term objective which is the EU fiscal rule,"" EU
Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told the news conference.
    EU rules require governments to seek a budget in balance or
in surplus in structural terms, which exclude one off revenues
and expenditures and the effects of the business cycle.
    Moscovici added that at this stage was not possible to say
whether Italian plans for a 2.4 percent headline deficit in 2019
would allow for a reduction of the country's huge public debt.
    The EU executive has dealt in previous years with budgets
breaking EU rules from France, Spain, Portugal and Italy itself.
It has always opted to enter some form of negotiation with the
government concerned, branding the draft as ""at risk of
non-compliance"" or ""at serious risk of non-compliance"". 
    But officials indicated it might be different now. 
    ""Never were rules broken so bluntly, without the slightest
grain of elegance,"" one senior official said.
    Moscovici said that while rules had to be respected, he was
keen to maintain dialogue with Rome -- code for negotiations
over the next two weeks, before Italy submits the final version
of the budget, that could save face for both sides.
    Le Maire said Italy's euro zone peers would be gradually
applying pressure on Rome.
    ""I think we have to go step by step,"" he said, adding
respect for EU rules was key when the EU was facing a serious
threat from rising ""populist and nationalist movements"".

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year borrowing costs
hit their highest since March 2014 after a senior official from
the League, one of the two parties in the ruling coalition, said
most of the country's problems would be solved if it returned to
its own currency.
    Claudio Borghi's reference to the possibility of Italy
leaving the single currency bloc jolted a market already shaken
by the government's budget proposal last week, which put Rome on
a collision course with the European Union. [nR1N1VZ00K]
    The yield on the country's 10-year government bond
<IT10YT=RR> rose 11 basis points to a 4-1/2 year high of 3.41
percent, topping the level hit after a brutal sell off on May 29
when the concerns over redenomination risk were at their peak.  
  
    The closely watched Italy/Germany bond yield spread widened
to 296 basis points, only 4 basis points short of that May 29
peak, when that spread was at its widest in five years.
<IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>     
    ""In this environment when everyone is nervous, these
comments just adds to the risk-off sentiment,"" said Commerzbank
strategist Christoph Rieger. ""It smells clearly like the crisis
days,"" he added, referring to the euro zone debt crisis of
2010-2012, when the breakup of the currency bloc was a distinct
possibility.  
    Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from
the EU's executive head, Jean-Claude Juncker, comparing Italy
with Greece. 
    ""I would not wish that, after having really been able to
cope with the Greek crisis, we'll end up in the same crisis in
Italy,"" Juncker said in a speech in Germany. [nB5N1O400K]
    Italy's two-year government bond yield was up 6 bps to a
one-month high of 1.45 percent, and five-year bond yields rose
more than 10 bps to a four-month high of 2.687 percent.
<IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>     
    Despite the reaction of both the market and the EU to the
Italian government's spending plans, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi
Di Maio said on Tuesday Italy will not change its budget deficit
targets. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    The Italian government is to finalise the 2019-2021 budget
programme later on Tuesday, he said. 
    Other euro zone government bond yields dropped on Tuesday as
investors retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such
as Germany, Netherlands and Austria. 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, dropped to a two-week low of 0.44 percent
<DE10YT=RR> and its two-year bond yield hit a one-month low of
minus 0.595 percent <DE2YT=RR>.

that Italy will bring its 2019 budget draft in line with

Vice President for the euro Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday.
    EU budget rules, called the Stability and Growth Pact, say
that euro zone governments have to bring their structural budget
balance, which excludes one-offs and the effects of business
cycles, to balance or surplus.
    Italy wants to increase its deficit, even though it has the
second highest public debt in the euro zone after Greece in
terms of GDP.
    ""What we see currently now seems to be not compliant with
the Stability and Growth Pact but we are open to dialogue with
the Italian authorities and hope that the budget will be brought
in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact,""
Dombrovskis said.
    Asked about comments of Claudio Borghi, the economic head of
Italy's ruling League party, that Italy would enjoy more
favourable conditions outside the euro [nR1N1VZ00K], Dombrovskis
said he would not be drawn into such speculations.

    PRAGUE, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman may
tap economist and investment strategist Ales Michl, who advises
Prime Minister Andrej Babis, to fill one of two seats coming
free on the central bank board this year, daily Lidove Noviny
reported on Tuesday.
    The newspaper, citing two sources, said Michl, 40, could
replace Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl, whose final term at the bank
finishes at the end of November along with Vice-Governor
Vladimir Tomsik.
    The president's spokesman declined to comment on the report,
while Michl was not immediately available. He had declined
earlier to comment for the newspaper.
    The report mentioned other names which have been circulated
in the past as possible candidates for the central bank board,
including the current chief of the bank's monetary section which
prepares the quarterly economic outlook for the board, Tomas
Holub.
    Besides him, former board member Jan Frait, who now heads
the financial stability department, and his deputy, Libor Holub,
were also mentioned.
    Michl worked for almost a decade until 2015 as an investment
strategist at Raiffeisenbank, the Czech unit of Austrian bank
Raiffeisen. He later went on to found an investment group that
uses algorithms to invest into U.S. shares and bonds.
    Tomsik and Hampl are the last board members appointed by the
previous president, Vaclav Klaus, who had favoured more
eurosceptic economists than Zeman.
    The central bank advises the government on the country's
eventual adoption of the common euro currency that it committed
to when joining the European Union in 2004. The state currently
does not have any target date. 
    Governor Jiri Rusnok, who is an economic adviser to Zeman,
has sat on the board since 2014 and led it since 2016.
    The central bank quit an intervention regime keeping the
crown weak in 2017 after using it for almost four years, part of
efforts to revive inflation after the country went through two
recessions following the global financial crisis a decade ago.
    Since letting the crown float free again, the bank has been
the most aggressive in the EU in normalising policy by raising
its main interest rate <CZCBIR=ECI> in six steps to 1.50
percent, including hikes at its past three meetings.[nL8N1WC446]
    The bank seeks to keep inflation close to a 2 percent target
and is contending with a fast-growing economy in which
unemployment is the lowest in the EU and wages are growing the
fastest in 15 years along with a hot real estate market.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's said it was
questionable whether Italy's current political environment would
allow key structural reforms to take place but played down the
possibility that Rome could exit the euro zone.
    Italian financial markets and the euro sold off earlier on
Tuesday after Carlo Borghi, a lawmaker from one of the two
ruling parties, said most of the country's problems would be
solved if it returned to its own currency. They recovered
somewhat after he said the country was not planning to leave the
euro [nR1N1RB01P]
    Moody's, which rates Italy Baa2 with a negative outlook, is
due to provide an updated decision on Italy's credit rating by
the end of October at the latest, having delayed its scheduled
review from September 7. 
    The agency said in comments released for publication late on
Monday that the review for possible downgrade hinged on Italy's
debt trajectory and economic growth, both of which are linked to
structural reforms being implemented 
    ""Italy has long had an elevated debt burden and has long had
problems generating economic growth and the political
environment that can allow structural reform efforts to take
place is also in question,"" Sarah Carlson, senior vice president
in the Moody's sovereign team said in a conference call.
    ""It comes down to the debt trajectory and growth which is
linked to structural reform effort,"" Carlson added.
    Investors are concerned that a higher-than-expected budget
deficit of 2.4 percent will weaken Italy's ability to service
its debt pile of 131 percent of gross domestic product and risk
lowering its credit rating, putting it on the cusp of falling
below the investment grade category. 
    However, Moody's played down fears for euro zone stability
stemming from Italy and the possibility of the country exiting
the single currency, noting Italians had shown reluctance to
leave the euro. Italy was ""more integrated with Europe than has
been feared over the past few years"", the agency added.
    Fitch reviewed Italy in August and while it kept the rating
unchanged at BBB, it put Italy on negative outlook. S&P reviews
Italy on October 26. It currently rates Italy at BBB with a
stable outlook.

    By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Former foreign
minister Boris Johnson will call on the governing Conservative
Party on Tuesday to return to its traditional values of low tax
and strong policing, pressing his challenge to British Prime
Minister Theresa May.
    With just six months before Britain leaves the European
Union, May's precarious position at the helm of her party has
been further shaken by criticism of her Brexit plans, both at
home and in Brussels.
    Johnson, who became the figurehead for the campaign to leave
the EU, has been one of her loudest critics, describing her
plans to keep close ties with the bloc as ""deranged"" and little
more than a bid to turn Britain into a vassal state.
    May has shown little sign of moving away from her so-called
Chequers plan, but after trying to display unity over Brexit at
her party's annual conference in the city of Birmingham, her
former foreign secretary looks set to shatter those attempts.
    In a speech that will do little to temper talk that Johnson,
who quit over May's Brexit plan, is launching a bid to replace
her, he will urge the party against trying to ""ape"" the policies
of the main opposition Labour Party.
    ""We must on no account follow (Labour leader Jeremy) Corbyn,
and start to treat capitalism as a kind of boo word,"" he will
say, according to excerpts of his speech.
    ""We can't lose our faith in competition and choice and
markets but we should restate the truth that there is simply no
other system that is so miraculously successful in satisfying
human wants and needs.""
    May's team had hoped the party's annual conference would
hand her a platform to revitalise a pledge she made when she
became prime minister in 2016 to help those people who are ""just
about managing"" and try to steal the initiative from Labour.
    But the conference has been dominated by Brexit, with
eurosceptic lawmakers attracting hundreds of Conservative
members to their events on the fringes. Only handfuls turned out
to hear ministers' speeches in the main hall.
    
    BELIEF
    Johnson's speech will do little to change that.
    There is little doubt that he will renew his attack on May's
Brexit plans and call for support for his competing proposal -
an enhanced free trade deal based on the one agreed between the
EU and Canada.
    Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister, offered Johnson some 
support by again defending the proposal - something May says
would create a new border between the British province of
Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.
    ""We believe that we have produced a proposal which can
operate within the current framework of technology and
administration to deliver a free flowing border with no
infrastructure on the island of Ireland within the boundaries of
a free trade agreement,"" Baker told BBC radio. [nL9N1VJ00G]
    But May again said she was pressing on with her Chequers
plan, named after her country residence where she hashed out
agreement with her ministers in July, and that she would bring
new proposals to unlock stalled Brexit talks. [nL9N1VJ00D]
    The split over the EU, which has dogged the Conservative
Party for decades, has never been wider.
    Johnson, the first Conservative to become mayor of largely
left-leaning London, will use his speech to try to get the party
faithful onside, with a rallying cry to take the fight to the
Labour Party.
    He is not universally liked. Several members of the cabinet
and in the wider party have criticised him for undermining May
at a time when the talks to leave the EU are entering one of
their toughest phases. Some have balked at the idea of him
becoming party leader.
    But his call to re-energise the Conservative brand will
strike a chord with some members who fear that Labour has stolen
the domestic agenda.
    ""We should set our taxes to stimulate investment and growth.
We should be constantly aiming not to increase but to cut
taxes,"" he will say. ""It is the conservative approach that gets
things done, so let's follow our conservative instincts.""

    By Teis Jensen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Parliament has
invited the whistleblower who helped reveal suspected money
laundering at Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> to testify on Nov 21
before its special committee on financial crimes, tax evasion
and tax avoidance.
    Howard Wilkinson was a former head of Danske Bank's trading
business in the Baltics, Danish newspaper Berlingske reported
last week.    
    ""Howard Wilkinson, as far as we know, has gone underground.
But we have secured a communication channel for him, and will
convey him the official invitation as soon as the secretariat
has made it,"" committee spokesman Jeppe Kofod said in emailed
answers to questions from Reuters.
    Danske last month reported that 200 billion euros ($235
billion) of payments moved through its Estonian branch between
2007 and 2015 - an amount equivalent to 10 times Estonia's GDP -
and that of the transactions it had analysed many appeared
suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    The Danish bank faces criminal investigations in Denmark and
Estonia and Britain's National Crime Agency said it is examining
the use of UK-registered companies related to suspected money
laundering at Danske. [nL5N1UX4JN][nL5N1UR2VM][nL8N1W717P]
    Briton Wilkinson is not obliged to accept the European
Parliament's invitation. Normally such a hearing would be public
and livestreamed, committee spokesman Kofod said.
    ""I fully understand his concerns about reprisals. Therefore,
I am also open for his testimony to be delivered in a way that
is safe and secure for him,"" Kofod said.
    The hearing would allow committee members to pinpoint
exactly where Danske and the Danish and Estonian financial
watchdogs failed, he said.
    ""That would allow us as legislators to tighten up the
relevant EU legislation and strengthen the supervision of the
banks and national supervisory authorities so that we hope in
the future to avoid the range of huge money laundering scandals
that have hit Europe recently,"" Kofod said.
    Wilkinson's lawyer, who is based in the United States, has
not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the invitation.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a six-week low on
Tuesday after a senior official from Italy's ruling party said
most of the country's problems would be resolved if it scrapped
the euro for a national currency, triggering a broad market
sell-off.
    The euro also slumped against the safe-haven yen and Swiss
franc, while the dollar surged to a one-month high as investors
piled into greenback and sold riskier assets such as equities. 
    Markets are highly sensitive to Italian political
developments after the ruling parties proposed a budget with a
higher-than-expected deficit target, exacerbating tensions with
other euro zone leaders and worrying investors who want Rome to
bring its debt under control.
    The euro's weakness combined with a further push higher by
the dollar, which is regaining its stride despite investor
positioning in the greenback looking stretched.
    The single currency <EUR=> skidded to as low as $1.1507, its
weakest since Aug. 21. Against the yen, the euro fell 0.9
percent to 130.80 <EURJPY=> and tumbled 0.6 percent versus the
Swiss franc to 1.1317 francs <EURCHF=>.  
    ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one
side and Italy on the other ... There's a lot of headline risk
about,"" Credit Agricole head of G10 FX Strategy Valentin Marinov
said. 
    Marinov said he did not expect the situation in Italy to
weigh heavily on the euro in the medium term because there was
""no real evidence of contagion"" that would worry the European
Central Bank and prompt it to postpone a gradual end to its
fiscal stimulus.
    Most of the euro's losses came after Claudio Borghi, the
economic head of the ruling League party, said Italy would enjoy
more favourable economic conditions outside the euro zone.
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    Borghi later rowed back on the comments, and said Italy's
government had no intention of leaving the euro [nR1N1RB01P]. 
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who accuses
European Union officials of deliberately upsetting financial
markets with negative comments about Italy's budget plans, also
said Italy would not change its budget deficit targets.
[nL8N1WI14R]
    Commerzbank analysts said that even if the EU did not reject
Italy's budget, it could still act as a hurdle for the euro,
especially as some analysts expect credit ratings agencies to
downgrade Italy's government debt. 
    ""Even if the subject (of Italy) seems to remain on the back
burner for the FX market at present, market participants should
keep a close eye on it. It can cook up more rapidly than we
think,"" they said.    
    
    DOLLAR RALLY
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.4 percent to 95.684, a
one-month high.
    Fears about trade conflicts between the United States and
major trading partners, including China, have lifted the dollar
this year, as has an increasingly confident U.S. Federal Reserve
especially as the U.S. central bank looks increasingly alone in
tightening policy. 
    Against the yen <JPY=>, the dollar fell 0.3 percent to
113.74 yen on the Japanese currency's safe-haven status. 
    The U.S.-Canada trade deal announced on Monday had sent the
yen to an 11-month low of 114.06 per dollar as the agreement
boosted investor appetite for taking risks.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> - often viewed as a barometer
of risk appetite - fell 0.9 percent $0.7162 as markets worldwide
sold off on the euro zone concerns.
    The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it had held interest
rates at 1.5 percent, a widely expected decision. [nL4N1WI00J]
    The Canadian <CAD=> fell 0.2 percent to C$1.2834 per dollar,
reversing some of its gains the previous day.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year bond yield soared
to a 4-1/2 year high on Tuesday as a Rome lawmaker's contention
that most of its problems would be solved if it ditched the euro
deepened market concerns over its public finances.
    That pushed the gap between Italian and German yields to the
widest in over five years. The spread <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>
briefly hit 302 basis points and, as euro zone officials warned
of a return to crisis days, the Italian/Spanish yield gap was at
its widest over any closing price in the last 20 years.
[nL8N1WH6BL]
    The reference by Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League
party, to the possibility of Italy leaving the single currency
bloc jolted a market already shaken by a budget proposal last
week that put Rome on a collision course with Brussels.
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    While Borghi on Tuesday clarified that the government had no
intention of leaving the euro, yields remained elevated and
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated Italy would not
change its budget deficit targets. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    Italy's 10-year government bond <IT10YT=RR> rose 14 basis
points to a 4-1/2 year high of 3.44 percent, topping the level
hit after a brutal sell-off on May 29 when concerns over
redenomination risk reached a peak.     
    
    ""In this environment when everyone is nervous, these
comments just add to the risk-off sentiment,"" said Commerzbank
strategist Christoph Rieger. ""It smells clearly like the crisis
days,"" he added, referring to the euro zone debt crisis of
2010-2012, when the breakup of the currency bloc was a
possibility.
    Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from
the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker comparing Italy
with Greece.   
    ""I would not wish that, after having really been able to
cope with the Greek crisis, we'll end up in the same crisis in
Italy,"" Juncker said late on Monday. [nB5N1O400K]    
    Italy's two-year bond yield was up 20 bps at 1.57 percent
the five-year yield jumped 21 bps to 2.77 percent, both hitting
their highest in about four months. <IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR>
    Italian two-year bond yields are up 51 bps this week alone,
putting them on track for their biggest weekly rise since June.
Trading volume in two-year BTP futures in the last two days is
the heaviest since May. 
    
    ITALIAN BANKS, EURO HIT
    The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.1510 <EUR=>, nearly a
five-week low, after Borghi's comment on the currency. 
    Shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, whose large government
bond holdings make them sensitive to political developments,
fell as much as 3.9 percent to their lowest in 19 months, on
fears a bond sell-off would cut their capital ratios, increase
their funding costs and hamper efforts to cut bad loans. 
    The bank index was last down 2.7 percent. Shares in Italy's
largest lenders Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>
both fell more than 2.5 to multi-month lows.    
    The Italian government is to finalise the 2019-2021 budget
programme later on Tuesday, Di Maio said. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""Neither the EU or Italy is incentivised to compromise it
seems, at least in the opening gambit of the talks,"" said
Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset
Management.    
    He said Italy's 10-year borrowing costs could reach 4
percent by the end of the year.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields fell as investors
retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such as
Germany, Netherlands and Austria. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield tumbled five bps to 0.42
percent <DE10YT=RR> and its two-year bond yield hit a one-month
low of minus 0.596 percent <DE2YT=RR>.

target a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP, down from this year's
estimated 0.7 percent, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said,
confirming an earlier plan released in April which was
criticised by his leftist allies.
    In an interview with TVI television channel, Costa said the
budget negotiations with the Left Bloc and the Communist party,
which back the minority Socialist government in parliament, ""are
going well"" as he reaffirmed the deficit target.
    ""We should close the year with (a budget deficit of) 0.7
percent and 0.2 percent next year. We won't have an
electioneering budget,"" he said, referring to next year's
national election.
    The Socialists lead in opinion polls by a wide margin,
although just short of a parliament majority, which means they
will probably have to maintain an alliance on the left.
    The government will present the budget in October.
    Since coming to power in late 2015, Costa's government has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with measures to support
growth, while reversing most of the austerity policies imposed
by a centre-right administration during the 2010-14 debt crisis.
    In a stability programme for 2018-2022, presented in April,
the government also projected a surplus - which would be the
country's first - of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2020.
    The Eurosceptic Left Bloc and the Communists have argued
that the administration should spend more on healthcare and
civil servant wages rather than focusing on cutting the deficit.
    Last year Portugal hit a more than four-decade low in its
budget gap of 0.9 percent of GDP, excluding a one-off bank
recapitalisation, as the economy grew 2.7 percent - its
strongest pace since 2000.
    Growth this year should be 2.2-2.3 percent in a slowdown
from last year, with the same pace of expansion expected next
year and in 2020.

euro and any critical comments about the single currency are
individual opinions which have nothing to do with the
government's policies, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on
Tuesday.
    Conte spoke after a eurosceptic lawmaker in the ruling
League party said earlier that Italy would benefit from more
favourable economic conditions if it were outside the euro zone,
roiling financial markets. [nR1N1RB01P]
    ""The euro is our currency and for us it is unrenounceable,""

ministers expect Italy to observe EU budget rules in its 2019
budget, Austrian Finance Minister Hartwig Loger whose country
holds the rotating EU presidency, told a news conference on
Tuesday.
    EU budget rules, called the Stability and Growth Pact, say
that euro zone governments have to bring their structural budget
balance, which excludes one-offs and the effects of business
cycles, to balance or surplus.
    Italy wants to increase its deficit, even though it has the
second highest public debt in the euro zone after Greece in
terms of GDP. 
    Loger said that euro zone ministers were jointly responsible
for the financial stability of the single currency area.
    ""Our expectation is still that if we have rules at the
European level, these rules are observed. This is our
expectation. The majority of the member states will clearly ask
and demand that these rules are observed,"" he said.
    European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, also
present, said Italy had the highest debt servicing costs in the
European Union and therefore had to have responsible budget
policy to be able to carry that burden.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a six-week low on
Tuesday after a senior lawmaker in one of Italy's ruling parties
said most of the country's problems would be resolved if it
readopted a national currency, triggering a broad market
sell-off.
    The euro also slumped against the safe-haven yen and Swiss
franc, while the dollar surged to a one-month high as investors
piled in and sold riskier assets such as equities. 
    Markets are highly sensitive to Italian political
developments after the country's coalition proposed a budget
with a higher-than-expected deficit target, exacerbating
tensions with other euro zone leaders and worrying investors who
want Rome to bring its debt under control.
    The lawmaker, Claudio Borghi, later rowed back on the
comments, while Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the euro was
""unrenounceable"". [nR1N1RB01P] [nR1N1RB01S]. 
    But that failed to ease pressure on the single currency
<EUR=>, which skidded as low as $1.1505, its weakest since Aug.
21. Against the yen, the euro lost almost one percent to 130.71
<EURJPY=> before recovering some ground, and dropped 0.6 percent
versus the Swiss franc to 1.1313 francs <EURCHF=>.  
    ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one
side and Italy on the other ... There's a lot of headline risk
about,"" Credit Agricole head of G10 FX Strategy Valentin Marinov
said. 
    Marinov did not expect the situation in Italy to weigh
heavily on the euro in the medium term because there was ""no
real evidence of contagion"" that would worry the European
Central Bank and prompt it to postpone plans to end its stimulus
programme.
    The euro's weakness combined with a further push higher by
the dollar, which is regaining its stride despite investor
positioning in the greenback looking stretched.
    Most of the common currency's losses came after Borghi, the
economic head of the right-wing League party, said Italy would
enjoy more favourable economic conditions outside the euro zone.
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who accuses European
Union officials of deliberately upsetting financial markets with
negative comments about Italy's budget plans, also unnerved
investors by reiterating that it would not change its fiscal
deficit targets. [nL8N1WI14R]
    
    
    Even if the EU does not reject Italy's budget, it could
still act as a hurdle for the euro, Commerzbank FX strategists
said, especially as some analysts expect credit ratings agencies
shortly to downgrade Italy's government debt. 
    ""Even if the subject (of Italy) seems to remain on the back
burner for the FX market at present, market participants should
keep a close eye on it. It can cook up more rapidly than we
think,"" they wrote.    
    
    DOLLAR RALLY
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.4 percent to 95.693, a
six-week high.
    Fears about a rumbling U.S./China trade conflict have lifted
the dollar this year, as has an increasingly confident U.S.
Federal Reserve, which looks to be more and more alone in
tightening policy. 
    Against the yen <JPY=>, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to
113.78 yen on the Japanese currency's safe-haven status. 
    A U.S.-Canada trade deal announced on Monday had sent the
yen to an 11-month low of 114.06 per dollar as the agreement
boosted investor appetite for risk.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> - often viewed as a barometer
of risk appetite - fell 0.9 percent $0.7162 as markets worldwide
were spooked by the euro zone concerns. The Reserve Bank of
Australia earlier held interest rates at 1.5 percent, a widely
expected decision. [nL4N1WI00J] [nRBA]
    The Canadian <CAD=> fell 0.2 percent to C$1.2840 per dollar,
reversing some of its gains on Monday.
    Sterling <GBP=>, hit both by the broader market tumble and
the latest Brexit nerves, skidded 0.7 percent to as low as
$1.2941.

    By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
    BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Former foreign
minister Boris Johnson will call on the governing Conservative
Party on Tuesday to return to its traditional values of low tax
and strong policing, pressing his challenge to British Prime
Minister Theresa May.
    With just six months before Britain leaves the European
Union, May's precarious position at the helm of her party has
been further shaken by criticism of her Brexit plans, both at
home and in Brussels.
    Johnson, who became the figurehead for the campaign to leave
the EU, has been one of her loudest critics, describing her
plans to keep close ties with the bloc as ""deranged"" and little
more than a bid to turn Britain into a vassal state.
    May has shown little sign of moving away from her so-called
Chequers plan, but after trying to display unity over Brexit at
her party's annual conference in the city of Birmingham, her
former foreign secretary looks set to shatter those attempts.
    In a speech that will do little to temper talk that Johnson,
who quit over May's Brexit plan, is launching a bid to replace
her, he will urge the party against trying to ""ape"" the policies
of the main opposition Labour Party.
    ""We must on no account follow (Labour leader Jeremy) Corbyn,
and start to treat capitalism as a kind of boo word,"" he will
say, according to excerpts of his speech.
    ""We can't lose our faith in competition and choice and
markets but we should restate the truth that there is simply no
other system that is so miraculously successful in satisfying
human wants and needs.""
    May's team had hoped the party's annual conference would
hand her a platform to revitalise a pledge she made when she
became prime minister in 2016 to help those people who are ""just
about managing"" and try to steal the initiative from Labour.
    But the conference has been dominated by Brexit, with
eurosceptic lawmakers attracting hundreds of Conservative
members to their events on the fringes. Only handfuls turned out
to hear ministers' speeches in the main hall.
    Before Johnson took the stage, hundreds of Conservatives
queued to get a seat in a 1,500-seat conference hall. Many came
for the show, others to see if he would launch a leadership bid.
    
    BELIEF
    There is little doubt that Johnson will renew his attack on
May's Brexit plans and call for support for his competing
proposal - an enhanced free trade deal based on the one agreed
between the EU and Canada.
    Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister, offered Johnson some 
support by again defending the proposal - something May says
would create a new border between the British province of
Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.
    ""We believe that we have produced a proposal which can
operate within the current framework of technology and
administration to deliver a free flowing border with no
infrastructure on the island of Ireland within the boundaries of
a free trade agreement,"" Baker told BBC radio. [nL9N1VJ00G]
    But May again said she was pressing on with her Chequers
plan, named after her country residence where she hashed out
agreement with her ministers in July, and that she would bring
new proposals to unlock stalled Brexit talks. [nL9N1VJ00D]
    The split over the EU, which has dogged the Conservative
Party for decades, has never been wider.
    Johnson, the first Conservative to become mayor of largely
left-leaning London, will use his speech to try to get the party
faithful onside, with a rallying cry to take the fight to the
Labour Party.
    He is not universally liked. Several members of the cabinet
and in the wider party have criticised him for undermining May
at a time when the talks to leave the EU are entering one of
their toughest phases. Some have balked at the idea of him
becoming party leader.
    But his call to re-energise the Conservative brand will
strike a chord with some members who fear that Labour has stolen
the domestic agenda.
    ""We should set our taxes to stimulate investment and growth.
We should be constantly aiming not to increase but to cut
taxes,"" he will say. ""It is the conservative approach that gets
things done, so let's follow our conservative instincts.""

 (Adds Jaguar, Renault, more PSA comments)
    By Edward Taylor and Laurence Frost
    PARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Carmakers ratcheted up their Brexit
warnings on Tuesday, with France's PSA Group <PEUP.PA> and
Germany's BMW <BMWG.DE> both saying UK production would suffer
if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.
    With less than six months before Britain is due to quit the
EU on March 29, businesses are increasingly alarmed about the
lack of agreement over future trading relations and the
possibility of tariffs, delays at ports and extra red tape. 
    The car industry, one of the few British manufacturing
success stories of recent decades, is particularly at risk given
the thousands of parts, engines and finished models that move
between Britain and the continent every day. [nL8N1WC1N6]
    BMW boss Harald Krueger told the Paris Motor Show that he
sees a ""50:50 chance"" of a disorderly, or 'hard', Brexit and
that this would lead the company to shift more production of its
Mini vehicles - currently focused on its Oxford plant in
southern England - to the Netherlands. [nL8N1WI29O]
    ""I told (UK Prime Minister) Theresa May and the European
Union that if there is a hard Brexit, both sides are losers. We
will no longer fulfil trade agreements and then we are forced to
build the car in the Netherlands,"" Krueger told journalists.
    Carlos Tavares, the head of Peugeot and Opel maker PSA
Group, which has two factories in Britain, also said a no-deal
Brexit would be damaging.
    ""My plan is to tell Mrs May and Mr Barnier (the EU's chief
Brexit negotiator) that a no-deal (Brexit) is not acceptable,""
he told reporters.
    Such an outcome would have ""significant consequences"", he
added without elaborating.
    Dieter Zetsche, head of German carmaker Daimler <DAIGn.DE>,
also told the Paris event that scenarios involving a disorderly
Brexit were ""highly worrying"". [nL8N1WI1LF]
    The executives' comments come as the British prime minister
said she was preparing to make a new offer to the EU in an
effort to break the Brexit talks deadlock. [nL9N1VJ00D] 
    The various Brexit complications come against the backdrop
of a range of challenges facing automakers, including the
rollout of costly electric vehicles, tougher emissions rules and
potential disruption to trade from the rise of protectionism.
[nL8N1WH5YT]
    Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which warned
last month that the wrong kind of Brexit could cost tens of
thousands of car jobs, told Reuters it had not made a decision
whether to build electric cars in its home market because of
uncertainty over future trading relations. [nL5N1VX42Y]
[nL8N1WI2SG]
    Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance that has a
large assembly plant in northeast England, also complained about
the lack of clarity. 
    ""We are in a situation where everybody is frozen,"" he said.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year bond yield soared
to a 4-1/2 year high on Tuesday after an Italian lawmaker said
that most of the country's problems would be solved by ditching
the euro, deepening market concerns over its public finances.
    The comments by Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League
party, pushed the spread <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR> between Italian
and German yields to the widest in more than five years, briefly
hitting 302 basis points and as euro zone officials warned of a
return to crisis days, the Italian/Spanish yield gap was at its
widest over any closing price in the last 20 years. [nL8N1WH6BL]
    The reference to the possibility of Italy leaving the euro
jolted a market already shaken by a budget proposal last week
that put Rome on a collision course with Brussels. [nR1N1VZ00K]
    Borghi on Tuesday clarified that the government had no
intention of leaving the euro and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte
said Italy is totally committed to the currency. [nR1N1RB01S]
    This bought some calm to bond markets, with Italian yields
pulling away from their highs, but borrowing costs remained
elevated as concerns about the fallout from Italy's 2019 budget
plans lingered.
    Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated Italy would
not change its budget deficit targets. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""Fundamentally, investors know Italy's government is not
going to turn on its commitments, so you are still going to have
a fiscal policy that is inappropriate, given Italy's debt
metrics,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at
Daiwa Capital Markets.
    Italy's 10-year government bond yield <IT10YT=RR> hit a
4-1/2 year high of 3.44 percent, before pulling back to 3.36
percent -- still up 7 basis points on the day.         
    Italy's two-year bond yield was up 5 bps at 1.42 percent and
five-year yields briefly jumped 21 bps to 2.77 percent, both
hitting their highest in about four months. <IT2YT=RR>
<IT5YT=RR>
    Trading volume in two-year BTP futures in the last two days
is the heaviest since May <FBTSc1>.
    ""In this environment when everyone is nervous, these
comments just add to the risk-off sentiment,"" said Commerzbank
strategist Christoph Rieger. ""It smells clearly like the crisis
days,"" he added, referring to the euro zone debt crisis of
2010-2012, when the breakup of the bloc was a possibility.
    Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from
the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker comparing Italy
with Greece. [nB5N1O400K]    
    
    ITALIAN BANKS, EURO HIT
    The euro fell to a six-week low at $1.1505 <EUR=> after
Borghi's comment and shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, whose
government bond holdings make them sensitive to political
developments, fell as much as 3.9 percent to their lowest in 19
months on fears a bond sell-off would cut their capital ratios,
raise their funding costs and hamper efforts to cut bad loans. 
    The bank index was down 0.8 percent, with shares in Italy's
largest lenders Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>
both falling more than 2.5 to multi-month lows.
    The cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign debt and
the debt of the country's largest lenders also rose sharply.
[nS8N1S000T]    
    The Italian government is to finalise the 2019-2021 budget
programme later on Tuesday, Di Maio said. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""Neither the EU or Italy is incentivised to compromise it
seems, at least in the opening gambit of the talks,"" said
Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset
Management.    
    He said Italy's 10-year borrowing costs could reach 4
percent by the end of the year.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields fell as investors
retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such as
Germany, Netherlands and Austria. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield slipped three bps to 0.44
percent <DE10YT=RR>, while Spanish and Portuguese bond yields
<ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR> were little changed - showing no signs
of contagion from the Italy bond sell off.

    By Karen Brettell
    NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a six-week low
on Tuesday after a senior lawmaker in one of Italy's ruling
parties said most of the country's problems would be resolved if
it readopted a national currency.
    Italy's coalition proposed a budget with a
higher-than-expected deficit target, exacerbating tensions with
other euro zone leaders and worrying investors who want Rome to
bring its debt under control.
    The lawmaker, Claudio Borghi, later rowed back on the
comments, while Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the euro was
""unrenounceable"". [nR1N1RB01P] [nR1N1RB01S]
    The single currency <EUR=> dropped as low as $1.1505, its
weakest since Aug. 21, before retracing to $1.1537, down 0.34
percent on the day.
    ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one
side and Italy on the other ... There's a lot of headline risk

said.
    Most of the common currency's losses came after Borghi, the
economic head of the right-wing League party, said Italy would
enjoy more favorable economic conditions outside the euro zone.
[nR1N1VZ00K]
    The euro has strong technical support at the $1.15 area,
which is the 50 percent retracement level of its rally from
August to September, said Win Thin, global head of currency
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
    A break below this level could mean further euro weakness to
the $1.13 area, Thin said.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=>, often viewed as a barometer of
risk appetite, fell 0.58 percent to $0.7181 as markets worldwide
were spooked by the euro zone concerns. The Reserve Bank of
Australia earlier held interest rates at 1.5 percent, a widely
expected decision. [nL4N1WI00J]
    As the euro's weakened, the U.S. dollar kept pushing higher
even though investor positioning in the greenback looks
stretched.
    “The main driver is the U.S. Fed, they signaled they are
comfortable with the U.S. economy to continue hiking rates,”
said Thin.
    The U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro since
Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as
expected and said it foresees another rate hike in December,
three more next year and one in 2020. [nW1N1UT023]
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.28 percent to 95.563, after
getting as high as 95.744, the highest since August 21.

    NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices rose on
Tuesday as a budget crisis in Italy and the resulting selloff in
Italian government debt sent investors seeking safe-haven bets. 
    Yields at the long end of the U.S. curve were down as much
as 3 basis points after Italy defied pressure from Brussels and
its euro zone partners to water down ambitious budget plans,
threatening to sue EU officials it said were to blame for a
deepening selloff in Rome's financial markets. [nL8N1WI4KW] 
     Italian 10-year bond yields <IT10YT=RR> soared to a new

the government attempted to backtrack. [nL8N1WI11F] 
    The U.S. 10-year yield <US10YT=RR> was last at 3.050 percent

    ""Overnight the risk-off tone continued as concerns with
Italy rose as their debt continued to get hit hard,"" said Justin
Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. The
move erased a rise in U.S. yields on Monday following the
negotiation of a trilateral free-trade pact between the United
States, Canada and Mexico. 
    The risk-off sentiment was also evident in the fall in
yields on German bunds, with the 10-year benchmark government
yield <DE10YT=RR> down 3.5 basis points on Tuesday. 
    U.S. and EU equities fell as appetite for risk decreased,
with bank stocks dragging the most, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average <.DJI>, S&P 500 <.SPX> and Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> all
opening lower.  
    Though turmoil in Italy may continue to send investors to
the Treasury market, a deluge of new corporate bond issues was
expected to put upward pressure on yields. Traders estimated
this week will see more than $40 billion in new issuance. 
    ""There's a lot of investment-grade supply - the Comcast deal
is probably going to price today. It's definitely weighing on
the market, definitely affected the long end,"" said Lederer.

two up to 40 years both in fixed and floating-rate format.
Investors are expecting a deal of at least $20 billion or more.

    LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year bond yield soared
to 4-1/2 year highs on Tuesday after a lawmaker said that most
of the country's problems would be solved by ditching the euro,
although reassuring comments from the government bought some
calm to a jittery market.
    Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League party, on
Tuesday clarified that the government had no intention of
leaving the euro, dialling back earlier comments on Italy's
membership of the bloc. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also said
Italy is totally committed to the currency. [nR1N1RB01S]
[nR1N1RB01P]
    In the wake of those comments, Italy's shorter dated
borrowing costs pulled back from four-month highs.
    Italy's two-year bond yield was up six bps at 1.43 percent,
comfortably below highs hit earlier in the day at 1.63 percent
<IT2YT=RR>. Five-year yields, which had jumped more than 20 bps
earlier in the session, were 9 bps higher in late trade at 2.65
percent <IT5YT=RR>.
    But further out the curve, borrowing costs remained elevated
as concerns about the fallout from Italy's 2019 budget plans
lingered.
    ""The assurances by the politicians that there are no plans
to leave the euro have reassured markets,"" said ING rates
strategist Benjamin Schroeder.
    ""But at the same time investors want to get a better handle
on what the budget means for Italy's debt sustainability.""
    Italy's 10-year government bond yield <IT10YT=RR> hit a
4-1/2 year high of 3.44 percent and held close to that level in
late trade, last up 14 bps on the day.         
    That left the gap <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR> between Italian
and German yields close to the widest in more than five years at
over 300 basis points.
    As euro zone officials warned of a return to crisis days,
the Italian/Spanish yield gap <ES10YT=RR> was at its widest over
any closing price in the last 20 years. [nL8N1WH6BL]
    The Greek/Italian yield gap fell to under 100 basis points,
its narrowest since 2009 <GR10YT=RR>. 
    Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated Italy would
not change its budget deficit targets. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""It smells clearly like the crisis days,"" said Commerzbank
strategist Christoph Rieger, referring to the euro zone debt
crisis of 2010-2012, when the breakup of the bloc was a
possibility.
    Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from
the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker comparing Italy
with Greece. [nB5N1O400K]        
    ITALIAN BANKS, EURO HIT
    The euro briefly fell to a six-week low at $1.1505 <EUR=>
after Borghi's comment.
    Shares in Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, whose government bond
holdings make them sensitive to political developments, fell as
much as 3.9 percent to their lowest in 19 months on fears a bond
sell-off would cut their capital ratios, raise their funding
costs and hamper efforts to cut bad loans. 
    The bank index was last down 0.7 percent, having erased a
bulk of its earlier losses. Shares in Italy's largest lenders
Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, while lower,
were off multi-month lows.
    Still, the cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign
debt and the debt of the country's largest lenders rose sharply.
[nS8N1S000T]    
    The Italian government is to finalise the 2019-2021 budget
programme later on Tuesday, Di Maio said. [nR1N1VZ00M]
    ""Neither the EU or Italy is incentivised to compromise it
seems, at least in the opening gambit of the talks,"" said
Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset
Management.    
    He said Italy's 10-year borrowing costs could reach four
percent by the end of the year.
    Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields fell as investors
retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such as
Germany, Netherlands and Austria. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield was last down four bps at 0.43
percent <DE10YT=RR>, while Spanish and Portuguese bond yields
<ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR> were little changed - showing no signs
of contagion from the Italy bond sell off.

Markets Committee meeting last week.

Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday she was continuing to work

asked whether comments by her partners in parliament, the DUP,

    Earlier, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)

    MILAN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday,
failing to benefit from a more positive mood on Wall Street as
anti-euro rhetoric from a senior Italian lawmaker spooked
investors also concerned about the fate of Britain's
negotiations to leave the EU.
    The benchmark STOXX 50E <.STOXX50E> ended the day down 0.7
percent with losses across sectors and bourses. 
    Italy's 10-year bond yield soared to 4-1/2 year highs after
an Italian lawmaker said most of the country's problems would be
solved by ditching the euro before reassuring comments from the
government bought calm to a jittery market.
    Italian banks <.FTIT8300>, whose large government bond
holdings make them sensitive to political stress, fell as much
as four percent but limited losses to 1.2 percent at the close. 
    Overall, euro zone banks <.SX7P> also took a hit but ended
the day down a limited 0.6 percent. 
    ""We expect months of scrutiny on the budget by Italian
institutions, the European Commission and rating agencies,"" said
Matteo Ramenghi, CIO for Italy at UBS Global Wealth Management.
    ""Investors are likely to retain a cautious approach until
further visibility on fiscal policy emerges,"" he added.
    But Italy was not the only concern investors had to face. 
    ""People are also looking at Brexit"", said ABR managing
director Harry Scheper, noting fears that a no-deal Brexit would
take its toll on the continent's economy.
    The pound slid to a three-week low during the session as a
conflict over UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan
escalated, with deep divisions on show at the ruling
Conservative Party's conference.   
    Among European heavyweight companies, Philips <PHG.AS>
dropped 3.6 percent after a Credit Suisse downgrade while
Siemens <SIEGn.DE> fell 2.6 percent after a downgrade from HSBC.
    Within the pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> shares in Royal
Mail <RMG.L> were the worst performers and hit an all-time low,
down 8.9 percent as brokers cut their price targets on the stock
following a surprise profit warning on Monday.

    Last week, Danish newspaper Berlingske named the

    Wilkinson's lawyer Stephen Kohn of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto
said he had not yet received the invitation. Wilkinson is not
obliged to accept the European Parliament's invitation.
    Danske last month reported that 200 billion euros ($235
billion) of payments moved through its Estonian branch between
2007 and 2015. It said that many of the transactions it had
analysed appeared suspicious.

    By Karen Brettell
    NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a six-week low on Tuesday after a senior lawmaker in one
of Italy's ruling parties said most of the country's problems would be resolved if it readopted a national
currency.
    Italy's coalition proposed a budget with a higher-than-expected deficit target, exacerbating tensions
with other euro zone leaders and worrying investors who want Rome to bring its debt under control.
    The lawmaker, Claudio Borghi, later rowed back on the comments, while Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte
said the euro was ""unrenounceable."" [nR1N1RB01P] [nR1N1RB01S]
    The single currency <EUR=> dropped as low as $1.1505, its weakest level since Aug. 21, before
retracing to $1.1541, down 0.30 percent on the day.
    ""We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one side and Italy on the other. ... There's a
lot of headline risk about,"" Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole, said.
    Most of the common currency's losses came after Borghi, the economic head of the right-wing League
party, said Italy would enjoy more favorable economic conditions outside the euro zone. [nR1N1VZ00K]
    The euro has strong technical support at the $1.15 area, which is the 50 percent retracement level of
its rally from August to September, said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York. A break below this level could mean further euro weakness to the $1.13 area, Thin
said.
    The Australian dollar <AUD=>, often viewed as a barometer of risk appetite, fell 0.51 percent to
$0.7186 as markets were spooked by the euro zone concerns.
    The U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro since Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve raised
interest rates as expected and said it foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year and
one in 2020. [nW1N1UT023]
    “The main driver is the U.S. Fed, they signaled they are comfortable with the U.S. economy to continue
hiking rates,” said Thin.
    Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday hailed a ""remarkably positive outlook"" for the U.S. economy, which
he feels is on the verge of a ""historically rare"" era of ultra-low unemployment and tame prices.
[nW1N1W5007]
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.25 percent to 95.531, after rising to 95.744, the highest level since
Aug. 21.
    Sterling slid to a three-week low as a conflict over UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan
escalated, with deep divisions on show at the ruling Conservative Party's conference. [nL8N1WI28W]

    The European Parliament said on Tuesday it would invite the
whistleblower to testify on Nov. 21 before its special committee
on financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance.
    Last week, Danish newspaper Berlingske named the
whistleblower as Howard Wilkinson, a former head of Danske
Bank's trading business in the Baltics.
    Danske reported last month that 200 billion euros ($235
billion) of payments moved through its Estonian branch between
2007 and 2015 - an amount equivalent to 10 times Estonia's GDP.
It said many of the transactions it had analysed appeared
suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Wilkinson's lawyer Stephen Kohn of U.S.-based Kohn, Kohn &
Colapinto said he had not yet received the invitation. Wilkinson
is not obliged to accept the European Parliament's invitation.
    ""There is a good chance he will attend the hearing,"" Kohn
told Reuters, adding that terms would have to be agreed with
Danske Bank.
    Wilkinson, a Briton, signed a non-disclosure agreement with
the bank when he left in 2014.
    The Danish bank faces criminal investigations in Denmark and
Estonia and Britain's National Crime Agency said it was
examining the use of UK-registered companies related to
suspected money laundering at Danske.
[nL5N1UX4JN][nL5N1UR2VM][nL8N1W717P]
    Wilkinson is not obliged to accept the European Parliament's
invitation. Normally such a hearing would be public and
broadcast live, committee spokesman Jeppe Kofod told Reuters.
    ""I fully understand his concerns about reprisals. Therefore,
I am also open for his testimony to be delivered in a way that
is safe and secure for him,"" Kofod said.
    The hearing would allow committee members to pinpoint
exactly where Danske and the Danish and Estonian financial
watchdogs failed, he said.
    ""That would allow us as legislators to tighten up the
relevant EU legislation and strengthen the supervision of the
banks and national supervisory authorities so that we hope in
the future to avoid the range of huge money laundering scandals
that have hit Europe recently,"" Kofod said.

to its lenders from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the
International Monetary Fund before they are due in a bid to cut
its debt servicing costs, its finance minister said on Tuesday.
    Greece, whose public debt amounts to 180 percent of its
gross domestic product, has received loans totalling about 280
billion euros under three international bailouts since 2010.
    The ECB holds about 12 billion euros worth of Greek debt
with an average maturity of four years and the IMF about 10
billion euros with an average maturity of three years.
    ""We have plans to pay the IMF and the ECB earlier and, you
know, this is a kind of restructuring because we swap expensive
debt for cheap debt,"" Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told
Greek state television.
    He said Athens, which emerged from its bailout in August,
could use part of a substantial cash buffer it has built with
its lenders to repay the ECB and the IMF debt.
    The buffer, which totals about 24 billion euros, covers
Greece's needs for at least two years.  
    Shut out of bond markets in 2010 after its debt crisis
erupted, Greece has been tiptoeing back and Tsakalotos said it
was in a position to decide when it would issue new debt thanks
to that cash buffer. 
    He added there was convergence with the lenders on Greece's
bid to revoke painful pension cuts mandated for next year.

    By Shinichi Saoshiro
    TOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro pulled ahead from a
six-week low on Wednesday after a report that Italy plans to
reduce its budget deficit in the coming years provided some
relief to the battered currency.
    The euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.1585 <EUR=> following its
descent to $1.1505 overnight, its lowest since Aug. 21.
    The single currency got some support after Italian newspaper
Corriere della sera reported that Rome aims to gradually reduce
its budget deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2021.
    The Italian government, in a tripling of its predecessor's
target, had last week set out a deficit goal of 2.4 percent of
GDP for the next three years, unnerving markets and prompting
criticism from European Commission officials.
    ""The euro was lifted, as the latest report on Italy's budget
appears to have prompted a bit of short covering following its
recent descent on budget woes,"" said Koji Fukaya, president at
FPG Securities in Tokyo.
    ""The market was relieved amid signs that perhaps Italy was
willing to play by the rules. The Italian budget could recede as
a market theme going forward, but that won't mean the euro can
regain its stride, with the dollar enjoying such an yield
advantage,"" Fukaya added.
    The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies
was 0.25 percent lower at 95.288 <.DXY> after scaling 95.744
overnight, its highest since Sept. 4.
    The yen, another safe-haven currency, also dipped against
peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian dollar.
    The greenback was up 0.15 percent at 113.79 yen <JPY=>,
recovering from the day's low of 113.59 plumbed earlier. 
    ""U.S. data due later today such as the non-manufacturing ISM
index and Friday's jobs report will provide a chance to see if
the economy is performing in line with the Fed's views,"" said
Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in
Tokyo.
    Ishikawa said the dollar has benefited from recent euro
weakness but that fundamental factors fortified after the Fed's
rate hike has played a larger role in the greenback's advance.
    The dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since last
Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as
expected and said it foresees another rate hike in December,
three more next year and one in 2020.
    The pound was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2995 <GBP=D4> after
dropping on Tuesday to $1.2941, its weakest since Sept. 10, as
conflicts over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan
escalated. [nL8N1WH6ZA]
    The Australian dollar was down 0.1 percent at $0.7180
<AUD=D4> and within touching distance of a two-week trough of
$0.7162 brushed on Tuesday.

a second consecutive month in August as spending on food and
drink and on online and mail orders decreased, data released on
Wednesday showed, mirroring in part a steady decline of consumer
sentiment.
    Retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the single currency
slipped by 0.2 percent month-on-month, although were up 1.8
percent year-on-year.
    Economists polled by Reuters had expected increases of 0.2
percent during the month and of 1.7 percent year-on-year after
July's decline of 0.6 percent month-on-month and rise of 1.0
percent from a year earlier. 
    The figures partially mirror a steady weakening of consumer
sentiment since hitting a 17-year high at the start of 2018.
    The month-on-month decline resulted from a 2.3 percent fall
in mail order and internet sales, along with 0.3 percent lower
purchases of food, drink and tobacco and a 0.6 percent drop for
automotive fuel.
    By contrast, online and mail order sales were the strongest
component of the year-on-year rise, at 4.9 percent, although
this was a far lower increase than in previous months.
    Sales of textiles and clothing dropped for a fourth
consecutive month. Non-food products as a whole were up 2.9
percent.
    On a country-by-country basis, retail sales rose most during
the month in Portugal, Ireland and Slovenia and fell by most in
Latvia, France and Finland.

    By George Georgiopoulos
    ATHENS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Piraeus Bank <BOPr.AT> said plans
to issue debt to bolster its capital were on track on Wednesday
as Greece's largest lender by assets faced a near 30 percent
share price fall.
    ""The plan's aim is to strengthen the bank's balance sheet
and enhance its capital base. The bank has made significant
progress on all fronts with regards to the implementation of the
plan,"" Piraeus Chief Executive Christos Megalou told Reuters.
     Although analysts said the 29.3 percent fall in its shares
to 1.16 euros by 1020 GMT was the result of negative investor
sentiment affecting the whole banking sector, Piraeus stock was
hit hardest, underperforming fellow Greek lenders Alpha Bank
<ACBr.AT>, Eurobank <EURBr.AT>  and National Bank <NBGr.AT>.
    Piraeus Bank's restructuring plan, which it has submitted to
supervisors at the European Central Bank, involves the issuance
of debt, likely to be a Tier-2 bond, among other measures.  
    ""The bank is in a continuous dialogue with the supervisory
authorities and monitors debt capital markets to identify the
window of opportunity for the non-dilutive capital instrument
issuance included in the plan,"" Megalou said.
    Greek bank stocks have have lost about 34 percent of their
value this year as they struggle to tackle non-performing loans
stemming from the country's sovereign debt crisis.
    While Greece emerged from its latest bailout in August, it
remains sub-investment grade and yields on its government paper
remain relatively high, affecting corporate borrowing costs.
    Piraeus, which is 26.2 percent owned by the country's HFSF

year-to-date rise of about 2 billion euros.
    It has reduced so-called non-performing exposures (NPEs),
which include loans past due more than 90 days plus restructured
loans likely to turn bad, by more than 5 billion euros, the
largest reduction by any bank in Greece, Megalou said.

    By Giuseppe Fonte
    ROME, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italy's populist government will cut
its budget deficit targets from 2020, Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria said on Wednesday, after investors sold off Italian assets
and European Union ministers criticised its plans to jack up
spending next year.   
    The ruling coalition last week said it planned to run a
deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next
year, tripling the previous government's target. It also said
that the deficit would stay at that level through 2021.
    The announcement unnerved markets and prompted criticism
from European Commission officials but 5-Star Movement leader
Luigi Di Maio was defiant on Tuesday, pledging not to backtrack
""by a millimetre"".[nL8N1WI4KW]
    However, government sources told Reuters on Wednesday the
aim now was to reduce the deficit and to no higher than 2.2
percent of GDP in 2020 and 2 percent in 2021, and possibly
lower. Next year's target remains 2.4 percent of GDP, they said.
    The news sent Italian government bond yields down, and
overnight the euro gained against the dollar. Italian bank
stocks <.FTIT8300> jumped by as much as 3 percent, but later
settled at a 0.8 percent gain. [nL8N1WJ0V5] [nL8N1WJ1H1] 
    Speaking at a meeting of Italy's largest employers' lobby,
Tria confirmed that the fiscal shortfall would be put on a
downward path after next year.
    ""The deficit will increase compared with the previous
forecast in 2019, but then there will be a gradual reduction in
the following years,"" he said, without spelling out what the
targets would be.
    Earlier, League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo
Salvini had indicated the government was changing tack compared
with last week's stance.
    ""The goal (next year) is to get Italians working again and
paying taxes as they work and therefore reduce the deficit and
debt in the following years,"" Salvini said in an interview with
private TV broadcaster Mediaset.
    
    DEBT
    The coalition came to power in June promising to slash taxes
and boost welfare spending, and says an expansionary budget next
year will boost economic growth and thereby curb Italy's debt -
the largest in Europe after Greece at about 131 percent of GDP.
    President Sergio Mattarella hopes there will be as little
deficit spending as possible, but is not trying to dictate
numbers to the government, a source close to the president said
on Wednesday.
    Italian media have reported Mattarella is exerting pressure
on the government behind the scenes to keep public finances
under control and avoid a head-on collision with the EU. 
    ""The majority of the member states will clearly ask and
demand that these (EU budget) rules are observed,"" Austrian
Finance Minister Hartwig Loger, whose country holds the rotating
EU presidency, said on Tuesday.
    Italy had previously pledged to Brussels that next year it
would reduce its structural deficit, which is adjusted for the
economic cycle and excludes one-off factors.   
    During his speech to employers, Tria played down the
government's plans to raise deficit spending next year.
    ""Even with a deficit goal that takes us further away from
the structural adjustment requested by Europe, it doesn't seem
to me that it can be said this government is carefree on
spending or that it's going to blow apart public accounts to
keep promises,"" Tria said. 
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to meet with key
ministers to discuss the  budget targets for 2019-2021 at around
1100 GMT on Wednesday, a separate government source said.

    STRASBOURG, France, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Romania appears to be
backsliding in its judicial reforms, the European Commission
said on Wednesday, underlining its concerns that the country
could be a potential domino after Hungary and Poland with their
perceived authoritarian drift.
    Plans by Romania's Social Democrat-led ruling coalition to
overhaul the judiciary and change legislation to potentially
decriminalise several corruption-related offences have drawn
criticism from the EU, the U.S. State Department and Romanian
magistrates, and have triggered large street protests.
    This is a worrying development, European Commission
Vice-President Frans Timmermans.
     ""We have seen substantial progress in the past but things
are now moving backwards in a way that would be damaging for the
place that Romania has built as an EU member state in recent
years,"" Timmermans told EU lawmakers during a debate on Romania.
    ""I call on the Romanian authorities to conduct full and
impartial investigations of this issue,"" he said.
    ""The reform to the judicial laws and criminal court are
interlinked and it must be avoided that they have a negative
impact on the independence of the judiciary and their
effectiveness to combat corruption.""
    Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila dismissed the
criticism. ""Do not deny Romania things that are permitted to
other member states of the Union and do not allow that in
Romania, things should happen that are unacceptable in other
member states,"" she told European Parliament.
    ""We want to be a partner but we want to be equal partners.
No one never will be able to turn Romania back from its European
road,"" Dancila said.
    The centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the largest
in the European Parliament, joined in the criticism.
    ""Romanians fought against communism for their liberties.
They tore down a tyranny and built a democracy. Such brave and
noble efforts should not be undermined,"" said Esteban Gonzalez
Pons, EPP vice-chairman.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission will
assess Italy's compliance with fiscal rules only against the
country's targets for next year, three EU officials said on
Wednesday.
    The clarification comes after the Italian government said
earlier on Wednesday it could reduce its deficit targets from
2020 after plans announced last week caused market turmoil.
[nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    In the next assessment of Italy's compliance with fiscal
rules, the Commission will take into account data for 2018 and
targets for next year, the officials said.
    ""Targets for 2020 and 2021 are not part of our assessment,""
one official said in answer to a question on Italy's plans to
revise down its deficit targets from 2020. 
    A spokesman for the Commission said Italy's budget for next
year will be assessed when it is submitted by mid-October.
    He added that, in that assessment, the Commission ""will take
into account the upcoming autumn forecasts"", which will provide
an outlook by the Commission of EU countries' growth, debt and
deficit trends for the 2018-2020 period. 
    The Commission said earlier this week that Rome's planned
budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2019, 2020 and 2021 was
likely to break EU budget rules, because it would mean Italy
would not be cutting its structural deficit or huge public debt.
    Rome responded on Wednesday by saying it would keep the
deficit in 2019 at 2.4 percent of GDP but could agree to reduce
the shortfall in 2020 and 2021.

    By Alissa de Carbonnel and Daphne Psaledakis
    STRASBOURG, Oct 3 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers backed a target
to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans by 40 percent
by 2030 in a vote on Wednesday that will set the stage for a
battle with national governments.
    Parties in the European Parliament tussled until the final
hours before the vote on how tough to make the curbs on one of
Europe's most important industries, part of efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
    EU lawmakers backed the target, which is tougher than that
proposed by the European Commission, by 389 to 239. They also
set a 20 percent target for 2025.  
    The parliament's environment committee, which leans toward
tougher action on climate change than the chamber as a whole,
last month backed a reduction of 45 percent by 2030 on emissions
of automakers' fleets of cars and vans. [nL5N1VW5JV]
    But the biggest political group, the centre-right European
People's Party, did not support that target, concerned it could
harm the industry's competitiveness. Lawmakers had been haggling
to reach a compromise before the vote.
    The executive European Commission's draft law proposes less
exacting CO2 reduction targets of 15 percent by 2025 and 30
percent by 2030 compared with 2021 levels.
    Wednesday's vote set lawmakers' position for negotiations on
the final targets with the bloc's 28 member states, which are
still debating their position.
    Germany, voicing worries that more ambitious climate targets
will cost jobs in its big automotive sector, has said it will
back the European Commission's initial proposal. [nL8N1WC3PB]
    But other EU governments, including France, are seeking a
higher target.
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it had
masked exhaust emissions using software in as many as 11 million
diesel vehicles worldwide has galvanised EU regulators into
setting tougher rules. [nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    ""Auto manufacturers and certain governments have not learned
their lessons from the Dieselgate scandal,"" said Karima Delli,
chair of parliament's transport committee.
    Germany set out its own plans on Tuesday to cut pollution
from older diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer trade-in
incentives and hardware fixes. [nL8N1WI1K1]
    The EU's new rules aim to help meet the bloc's goal of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below
1990 levels by 2030.
    They will introduce a credit system for carmakers to
encourage the rollout of electric vehicles, as well as fines for
exceeding CO2 limits.
    Under the plan, carmakers would be able to lower their CO2
targets by meeting a benchmark for the sale of zero- and
low-emission vehicles as a share of their total new car sales.
    An amendment introduced by lawmakers also adds penalties if
manufacturers fail to meet that benchmark.
    The European carmakers' lobby, however, has said a stricter
CO2 target than the 30 percent proposed by the Commission was
unrealistic and a threat to the sector's growth. [nL5N1VX2E5]

    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - As bond investors stress about
Italy's budget plans, key market gauges of euro break-up risks
are starting to flicker -- but to a far lesser degree than they
did just a few months ago.
    Italy's government appears set for a clash with the European
Union, given its spending plans for 2019 and beyond.
[nL8N1WI14R]
    Italy's 10-year bond yield hit 4 1/2-year highs on Tuesday
<IT10YT=RR>, gaining momentum after a lawmaker said most of
Italy's problems would be solved if it ditched the euro. 
    But in contrast to the brutal May selloff, market gauges
reflecting risks of Italy leaving the euro zone -- a possibility
market players dub ""Quitaly"" or ""Italexit"" -- are flickering
rather than flashing.
        
    1. CDS VS CDS 
    Italian credit default swaps (CDS), derivatives used to
protect against exposure to a default, are considered more
likely to pay out in event of ""Quitaly"", if the contract was
drawn up according to 2014 guidelines instead of earlier 2003
rules.
    Therefore, the difference between how the two types of CDS
trade is one gauge of whether markets are positioning for
redenomination. 
    While the gap between the two contracts has spread, it
remains below the width reached in May, when markets were roiled
by fears of a snap election that could become a de facto
referendum on the euro.
    ""It's clearly not as bad as May. Italy doesn't want to leave
the euro,"" said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at
Futures First Info Services.
    
    
    2. CACS IN THE CRADLE
    How investors trade Italian bonds issued before and after
2013 is also telling. 
    That year, regulators introduced new rules stipulating that
European government bond contracts contain collective action
clauses (CACs). This means that majority bondholder approval is
needed for a restructuring, including a change in the currency
of payment. 
    In late May, bonds issued before 2013 – and therefore
without CAC protection – sold off more sharply than debt issued
after 2013; for example, the yield gap between Italy's March
2022 bond issued in September 2011 and an April 2022 bond was 10
basis points.    
    
   Since then, the two issues have traded in lock-step, although
this week has seen some signs of slight preference for the 2017
issue, suggesting a ""Quitaly"" premium may be creeping back.
    
    3. NEW YORK OR ROME?
    During the May rout, Italy's two dollar-denominated bonds
maturing 2023 and 2033 outperformed their locally-issued, euro
denominated peers, as bonds governed by New York law offer
stronger protection against restructuring, including currency
redenomination.
    However, yields on both types of bonds have risen since
Italy delivered its budget deficit proposal last week.
    
    There are perhaps two explanations for this. 
    First, while the budget deficit forecast was higher than
expected, it did not breach the 3 percent limit mandated by the
EU, which would have raised questions about Italy's commitment
to the euro. 
    Second, overall rhetoric from top officials reaffirms
Italy's commitment to the euro [nR1N1RB01S].
    ""We think the key worry for markets right now is not an
‘Italexit’, but the impact from a wider fiscal deficit on
Italy's debt sustainability, especially given the backdrop of a
fast-approaching end to ECB QE,"" said TS Lombard senior
economist Shweta Singh.
    
    4. INFLATION STATION
    Italy issues inflation-linked bonds, some pegged to euro
zone inflation and others to Italian prices. 
    Demand for bonds pegged to euro zone consumer prices should
have more demand than those linked to domestic prices because
Italy's economic growth and inflation lag the bloc. 
    But that doesn't hold if a possible redenomination comes
into play, because a new Italian currency would probably fall,
fuelling inflation.
    So buying Italian inflation is a clean hedge for
redenomination risk. In May, yields and break-even levels on
Italy's May 2023 bond pegged to euro zone inflation and May 2023
bond pegged to Italian inflation were almost identical.
<IT525367=> <IT532934=> 
    In September, when hopes were for a market-friendly budget, 
the spread between the real yield of the two bonds widened to
nearly 30 basis points. It has now narrowed back to just 6 bps.
    
    5. LOVING THE SCHATZ
    German two-year government bonds -- the Schatz -- are a
favourite with investors nervous about a euro zone break-up.
    Bonds from top-rated Germany, the euro zone's biggest
economy, are viewed as some of the safest assets in the world.  
    Short-dated bonds also tend to benefit from near-term risks
and are seen by some as a proxy for the how the deutsche mark
would trade should it return. 
    The Schatz yield hit a one-month low at almost minus 0.60
percent <DE2YT=RR> on Tuesday as Italian bonds sold off.     
    In May, two-year yields tumbled far more, hitting one-year
lows, slid to record lows ahead of French elections last year
and dived after Britain's Brexit vote in 2016.
    ""This does seem to be seen as an Italian-specific issue
rather than a systemic issue for Europe,"" said David Zahn, head
of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton.

    PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - European Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici said the core element of Italy's public sector deficit
risked not being in line with the terms of euro zone rules if
the overall deficit being targetted in 2019 was 2.4 percent of
GDP as mentioned by Rome.
    Moscovici, whose portfolio at the EU executive is economic
and financial affairs, said Italy's 2019 budget had yet to be
formally notified to the European Commission for review.
    ""The rules are there,"" he said during a visit to Paris. ""If
it (the overall deficit) is 2.4 percent, it's possible that the
structural deficit will not be within the bounds of the (EU)
stability and growth pact,"" he said.

 (Adds reaction to the vote, details on amendments)
    STRASBOURG, Oct 3 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers backed a target
on Wednesday to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans
by an ambitious 40 percent by 2030,  defying lobbying by the car
industry and setting the stage for a battle with national
governments.
    Parties in the European Parliament tussled until the final
hours before the vote on how tough to make the curbs on one of
Europe's most important industries, part of efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
    EU lawmakers backed the target, which is more stringent 
than that proposed by the European Commission, by 389 to 239.
They also set a 20 percent target for 2025, with the reductions
based on 2021 figures. 
    In what came down to a clash between concerns over industry
competitiveness and fighting climate change, the European
carmakers' lobby warned the target backed by lawmakers could
costs jobs.
    The EU's new rules for the transport sector - the only one
in which emissions are still rising - aim to help meet the goal
of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990
levels by 2030.
    ""If we don't make sure that Europe is able to produce clean
cars within a reasonable time frame, we will not only miss our
Paris Climate Change targets but the European car industry will
lag behind,"" said Malta's Miriam Dalli, who shepherded the vote
through the chamber.
    The executive European Commission's own draft law proposes
less exacting CO2 reduction targets of 15 percent by 2025 and 30
percent by 2030 compared with 2021 levels.
    Wednesday's vote set lawmakers' position for negotiations on
the final targets with the bloc's 28 member states, which are
still debating their position.
    
    DIESELGATE
    Germany, voicing worries that more ambitious climate targets
will cost jobs in its big automotive sector, has said it will
back the Commission's initial proposal. It set out its own plans
on Tuesday to cut pollution from older diesel vehicles.
[nL8N1WI1K1] [nL8N1WC3PB]     
    But other EU governments, including France, are seeking a
higher target.
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> admission in 2015 that it had
masked exhaust emissions using software in as many as 11 million
diesel vehicles worldwide has galvanised EU regulators into
setting tougher rules. [nL5N1VW1V6] [nL5N1UL2JU]
    In response to a recent EU study that showed carmakers
cheating new pollution checks, EU lawmakers added an amendment
requiring figures to be verified against on-road tests.
[nL5N1UL2JU]
    They introduce a credit system for carmakers to encourage
the rollout of electric vehicles, as well as fines for exceeding
CO2 limits.
    Under the plan, carmakers would be able to lower their CO2
targets by meeting a benchmark for the sale of zero- and
low-emission vehicles as a share of their total new car sales.
    Wednesday's vote proposed to set these at 20 percent in 2025
and 35 percent in 2030 and added penalties for failing to meet
that benchmark.
    The European carmakers' lobby (ACEA), however, warned
against what it called ""extremely aggressive"" targets and sales
quotas for electric vehicles.
    ""Today's vote risks having a very negative impact on jobs
across the automotive value chain,"" ACEA's head Erik Jonnaert
said. ""It would essentially force the industry into a dramatic
transformation in record time."" [nL5N1VX2E5] [nL2N1WH085]

Wednesday it had extended duties on imported steel and iron
pipes and tubes from Russia and Ukraine for another five years.
    The duties on seamless pipes range from 24.1 to 35.8 percent
for imports from Russia and from 12.3 to 25.7 percent for
imports from Ukraine. Duties have been in place since 1997,
after EU producers claimed Russia and Ukraine were dumping the
products in European markets, and will now run until October
2023.
    The EU has 52 trade defence measures currently in place on
imported iron and steel products, many of them from China but 
also extending to other countries, such as Russia, India and
Turkey.
    The request for an extension came from the European Steel
Tube Association (ESTA), which argued that significant
quantities of dumped products would arrive if the measures
ended.
    The sector in Europe employs 13,000 people, with
manufacturing in the Czech Republic, France, Germany and Italy.

    ANKARA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Turkey's EU accession negotiations
have come to a standstill, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said
on a visit to Ankara on Wednesday, and it must address issues
including rule of law and human rights to make progress
possible.
    Turkey and the Netherlands agreed in July to try to improve
relations strained by a dispute over campaigning for last year's
referendum which granted President Tayyip Erdogan new powers.
    Ankara, now mired in a bitter dispute with the United States
which sent its currency plunging to a record low in August, is
pushing to mend ties with Europe.
    Speaking at a news conference alongside his Turkish
counterpart, Blok said they discussed the rule of law, human
rights and counter-terrorism, adding that Turkey needs to take
steps to make progress in its EU accession negotiations.
    ""The negotiations have come to a standstill. There are a lot
of criteria to be met, especially regarding the rule of law and
human rights,"" Blok said. ""Criteria are there to be met. Steps
have to be taken to make progress possible.""
    Last week Erdogan said during a visit to Germany that Turkey
would rapidly meet the criteria to achieve visa liberalisation
with the European Union, a move long sought by Ankara.
[nL8N1WE3KS]
    Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country
wanted to revitalise its relations with the bloc and said that
Blok's visit was an opportunity to move on from the ""troublesome
months"" between the two countries.
    Relations between Turkey and the EU worsened following a
2016 failed military coup, after which Ankara accused Europe of
not supporting it sufficiently and of harbouring individuals
allegedly involved in the abortive putsch.
    Rights groups and European countries have voiced concern
that mass arrests as part of a post-coup crackdown worsened
Turkey's record on human rights and press freedom under Erdogan.
    Facing an currency crisis aggravated by U.S. sanctions,
Turkey has been hoping to mend ties with the bloc and attract
more private investments.
    Asked if the Netherlands would take steps to help Turkey's
ailing economy, Blok said Turkey faced economic challenges but
also offered enormous possibility for growth.

    DUBLIN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Thousands of people marched on
Ireland's parliament on Wednesday in the latest angry protest
over a housing shortage that has sparked sharp increases in
rental costs and homelessness. 
    Housing has become the number one political issue ahead of a
possible election in the coming months and inside the building
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar defended his government's record,
pointing to nearly 20,000 new homes expected to be built this
year.
    ""There are limiting factors. There's only so much concrete,
only so many service sites, only so many construction workers.
We're ramping up things as quickly as we can,"" he said.
    While Ireland was left with a surplus of houses after a
property crash in 2008, it has come nowhere near providing the
number needed to keep up with a rapid economic recovery, with
rents in Dublin almost 20 percent above their pre-crisis peak.
    While rising, supply is still short of the 35,000 new builds
analysts say are needed annually just to keep up with demand.
    ""Everyone's struggling,"" said Emily Arnold, a 21-year-old
computer science student who travelled from the western town of
Sligo to join the protest. She plans to leave Ireland when she
graduates due to the high cost of living.
    ""Sligo's okay, it's getting a bit more expensive. We have to
work around the clock to afford it but there's no point coming
to Dublin, Galway's impossible too. We're going to Toronto, it's
cheaper to live out there for a year. Everyone's emigrating.""
    Dotted among the large groups of student protesters were
workers in their 30s with unstable, short-term tenancies unable
to save for a mortgage and older homeowners worried about how
their children will put a roof over their heads.
    ""The way things are at the moment, they haven't got a hope,""
said Sean Murphy, a retired bricklayer in his 70s who attended
the rally with two of his 13 grandchildren and one of his sons,
who fears being left homeless when his rent is next increased.
    ""You had a hope of getting a council house (years ago) but
it's far worse now. We've never had the amount of homeless that
we have and I think that speaks for itself. My children and
grandchildren's' generation are the working poor.""
    The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one of the organisers,
predicted that the protests will get larger and noisier.

    STRASBOURG, Oct 3 (Reuters) - There is ""no chance"" of Italy
defaulting on its debts and the country is very different from
Greece, Italy's minister for European affairs was quoted on
Wednesday as telling EU lawmakers.
    Paolo Savona was speaking after presenting a document to
Italian lawmakers in the European Parliament in which he
proposes a review of the EU's monetary and fiscal policy.
    ""I think there is no chance that Italy will default on its
public debt,"" Savona said, according to a person who attended
the meeting.
    Italy has the second largest debt in the European Union as a
proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) after Greece,
which has received three multi-billion-euro bailouts over the
past few years. Italy's debt exceeds 130 percent of GDP.
    Italy's populist-led government said last week it planned to
run a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP next year, tripling the
previous government's target.
    After the announcement triggered a sell-off in Italian
assets and EU criticism, Rome said on Wednesday it would cut its
deficit from 2020.
    Savona, who was his government's original pick as economy
minister but vetoed by Italy's president due to his critical
opinion of the euro, said he had presented to EU lawmakers a
document in which he proposed ""to reassess the European monetary
and fiscal policy in an integrated manner"".
    Savona was referring to a document he posted on his

    In that paper he called for the public debt of all euro zone
states to be brought below 60 percent of gross domestic product,
via long-term restructuring underwritten by the European Central
Bank [nL8N1W54SJ].
    Savona also said Italy was very different from Greece, in an
apparent reaction to remarks made by European Commission
President Jean-Claude Juncker.
    Juncker warned Rome this week against following a fiscal
policy that he said could cause a financial crisis like the one
experienced by Greece over the past few years [nB5N1O400K].

    * Higher funding costs ahead compound capital erosion
problem
    * Lenders' refinancing needs become more pressing in 2019

    By Valentina Za
    MILAN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A spike in Italy's bond yields has
put the country's banks under renewed pressure, raising the
spectre of capital shortfalls just as challenging refinancing
deadlines near.
    Domestic government bonds account for 10 percent of Italian
banks' total assets, making them vulnerable to a rise in Rome's
debt costs under the anti-austerity government.
    Caught in the bank-sovereign ""doom loop,"" Italian banks
replaced fleeing foreign investors during the euro zone debt
crisis of 2011-2012, buying up Italy's bonds. They similarly
stepped up purchases of domestic debt in May and June during a
market sell-off of Italian assets, before lowering them in
August as prices steadied. [nL8N1VI0NL]
    But as the yield premium Italian bonds pay over safer German
Bunds rose, banks lost on average 40 basis points of their core
capital in the second quarter and another 8 bps in the third,
analysts say. 
    When the new coalition's spending plans first emerged in
mid-May, the Italian-German spread was just 130 bps. It climbed
above 300 bps this week after the government unveiled deficit
goals that increase the borrowing needs of a country that has
the world's third-largest public debt pile.
    An increase to 400 bps would force some lenders to tap
investors for cash, the head of the Italian traders' association
Assiom Forex, Luigi Belluti, warned last week.   
    Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM <BAMI.MI> was among the
worst-hit in the second quarter, losing precious capital it
needs for a bad loan clean-up. Capital erosion also complicates
turnaround efforts at Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>,
bailed out by the state last year.
    
    REGULATORY PRESSURE?
    Italian banks have been restructuring in recent years,
raising capital to fund disposals of bad debt and cutting costs.
But loan losses and negative interest rates hurt earnings and
mean returns do not cover their cost of equity.
    Market stress is meanwhile driving up the cost of funding.
    Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, one of Italy's strongest banks, in
March paid 1.83 percent to issue a 10-year bond <IT178534017=>
that traded on Wednesday at 3.12 percent.
    Intesa is the only lender to have raised unsecured funds
since the May turmoil, selling five-year debt at a hefty 2.15
percent in August. [nL8N1VE4MC]
    Traders say the market has now frozen up again. 
    That is an issue for banks such as Monte dei Paschi and
Carige <CRGI.MI> which need to replenish their second-tier
capital with hybrid debt, and could become a problem across the
sector if the hiatus is prolonged. 
    With 240 billion euros in cheap longer-term funds from the
European Central Bank, of which they have been the biggest
takers, Italian banks have no immediate liquidity concerns.
    They have not suffered deposit flights and could easily
continue to shield their net interest income and get to the end
of the year without selling bonds.
    But market access is crucial.
    ""If the dearth of wholesale issues we're currently observing
were to last for another three to six months it would become a
real problem: regulators want banks to be able to tap markets
whenever they need to,"" said Francesco Castelli, head of fixed
income at Banor Capital.
    Italian banks had an average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
-- one of two key liquidity indicators monitored by supervisors
-- of 171 percent at end-2017, well above the required 100
percent, according to the Bank of Italy.
    The LCR ratio measures assets a bank can promptly sell for
cash and suffers if rising interest rates erode their value.    
    Larger-than-average liquidity buffers may reflect regulatory
pressure, Castelli said, adding supervisors would probably want
banks to keep those reserves intact when they start replacing
ECB funds with regular debt.
    
    SHARING THE PAIN
    Refinancing needs will become more pressing next year.
    Starting from mid-2019 Italian banks will have to exclude
from their net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the second key
liquidity indicator monitored by regulators, 140 billion euros
in longer-term loans that mature in June 2020.
    Even before the latest flare-up in Italian yields, rating
agency Moody's warned that Italian banks would see funding costs
rise as they repaid those ECB funds, pressuring earnings.
    Italian banks must also refinance by 2020 roughly half of
267 billion euros in bonds they had outstanding in February.
    They have traditionally relied on customers to buy debt but
stricter financial rules introduced after the global crisis of
2007-2008 and tax changes in Italy since 2012 now make retail
funding more difficult. 
    In a further funding challenge, banks will have to comply
with new European rules on debt and capital that can be wiped
out to absorb potential losses.
    ""There is a phase-in period from January 2019, but if they
don't start issuing efficiently next year banks might face
difficulties meeting the requirements,"" said Cristiano Tommasi,
a partner at law firm Allen & Overy. 
    UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, which has specific such requirements as
Italy's sole globally systemically important bank, has so far
met only around one third of its 2018 funding plan.
    Lenders have passed onto customers only one-fifth of a 100
basis point increase in yield premiums, but they may soon have
to share more of their pain with borrowers. 
    ""If bond spreads keep rising, sooner or later we'll have to
increase lending costs,"" a senior Italian bank executive said.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - As bond investors stress about
Italy's budget plans, key market gauges of euro break-up risks
are starting to flicker -- but to a far lesser degree than they
did just a few months ago.
    Italy's government appears set for a clash with the European
Union, given its spending plans for 2019 and beyond.
[nL8N1WI14R]
    Italy's 10-year bond yield hit 4 1/2-year highs on Tuesday
<IT10YT=RR>, gaining momentum after a lawmaker said most of
Italy's problems would be solved if it ditched the euro. 
    But in contrast to the brutal May selloff, market gauges
reflecting risks of Italy leaving the euro zone -- a possibility
market players dub ""Quitaly"" or ""Italexit"" -- are flickering
rather than flashing.
        
    1. CDS VS CDS 
    Italian credit default swaps (CDS), derivatives used to
protect against exposure to a default, are considered more
likely to pay out in event of ""Quitaly"", if the contract was
drawn up according to 2014 guidelines instead of earlier 2003
rules.
    Therefore, the difference between how the two types of CDS
trade is one gauge of whether markets are positioning for
redenomination. 
    While the gap between the two contracts has spread, it
remains below the width reached in May, when markets were roiled
by fears of a snap election that could become a de facto
referendum on the euro.
    ""It's clearly not as bad as May. Italy doesn't want to leave
the euro,"" said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at
Futures First Info Services.
    
    
    2. CACS IN THE CRADLE
    How investors trade Italian bonds issued before and after
2013 is also telling. 
    That year, regulators introduced new rules stipulating that
European government bond contracts contain collective action
clauses (CACs). This means that majority bondholder approval is
needed for a restructuring, including a change in the currency
of payment. 
    In late May, bonds issued before 2013 – and therefore
without CAC protection – sold off more sharply than debt issued
after 2013; for example, the yield gap between Italy's March
2022 bond issued in September 2011 and an April 2022 bond was 10
basis points.    
    
   Since then, the two issues have traded in lock-step, although
this week has seen some signs of slight preference for the 2017
issue, suggesting a ""Quitaly"" premium may be creeping back.
    
    3. NEW YORK OR ROME?
    During the May rout, Italy's two dollar-denominated bonds
maturing 2023 and 2033 outperformed their locally-issued, euro
denominated peers, as bonds governed by New York law offer
stronger protection against restructuring, including currency
redenomination.
    However, yields on both types of bonds have risen since
Italy delivered its budget deficit proposal last week.
    
    There are perhaps two explanations for this. 
    First, while the budget deficit forecast was higher than
expected, it did not breach the 3 percent limit mandated by the
EU, which would have raised questions about Italy's commitment
to the euro. 
    Second, overall rhetoric from top officials reaffirms
Italy's commitment to the euro [nR1N1RB01S].
    ""We think the key worry for markets right now is not an
‘Italexit’, but the impact from a wider fiscal deficit on
Italy's debt sustainability, especially given the backdrop of a
fast-approaching end to ECB QE,"" said TS Lombard senior
economist Shweta Singh.
    
    4. INFLATION STATION
    Italy issues inflation-linked bonds, some pegged to euro
zone inflation and others to Italian prices. 
    Demand for bonds pegged to euro zone consumer prices should
have more demand than those linked to domestic prices because
Italy's economic growth and inflation lag the bloc. 
    But that doesn't hold if a possible redenomination comes
into play, because a new Italian currency would probably fall,
fuelling inflation.
    So buying Italian inflation is a clean hedge for
redenomination risk. In May, yields and break-even levels on
Italy's May 2023 bond pegged to euro zone inflation and May 2023
bond pegged to Italian inflation were almost identical.
<IT525367=> <IT532934=> 
    In September, when hopes were for a market-friendly budget, 
the spread between the real yield of the two bonds widened to
nearly 30 basis points. It has now narrowed back to just 6 bps.
    
    5. LOVING THE SCHATZ
    German two-year government bonds -- the Schatz -- are a
favourite with investors nervous about a euro zone break-up.
    Bonds from top-rated Germany, the euro zone's biggest
economy, are viewed as some of the safest assets in the world.  
    Short-dated bonds also tend to benefit from near-term risks
and are seen by some as a proxy for the how the deutsche mark
would trade should it return. 
    The Schatz yield hit a one-month low at almost minus 0.60
percent <DE2YT=RR> on Tuesday as Italian bonds sold off.     
    In May, two-year yields tumbled far more, hitting one-year
lows, slid to record lows ahead of French elections last year
and dived after Britain's Brexit vote in 2016.
    ""This does seem to be seen as an Italian-specific issue
rather than a systemic issue for Europe,"" said David Zahn, head
of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton.

Thursday, extending the previous day's sharp falls, after Italy
said it would cut budget deficit targets from 2020 and reduce

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> said
on Thursday that it was being investigated by the U.S.
Department of Justice about non-resident accounts at its
Estonian branch which are at the centre of a 200 billion euro
($230 billion) money laundering scandal.
    The bank said in a statement it had ""received requests for
information from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in
connection with a criminal investigation relating to the bank’s
Estonian branch conducted by the DOJ,"" and was cooperating.
    Danske Bank also said it would end its share buyback
programme after reassessing its capital targets after Denmark's
Financial Services Authority said its compliance and
reputational risks are higher than previously thought.
    Shares in Danske Bank fell by three percent to 160 Danish
crowns, their lowest level since January 2015 and a 33 percent
decline so far this year. [nL8N1WK1H2]
    Last month, Danske Bank said in an internal report that
payments totalling 200 billion euros, many of which it described
as ""suspicious"", had been moved through its tiny Estonian branch
between 2007 and 2015. [nL8N1WB33L]
    That scandal led to Danske Bank's chief executive stepping
down and prompted regulators across the European Union to
question the oversight of the bloc's financial sector.
    Banks doing business in Estonia handled more than $1
trillion in cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, the
country's central bank said on Wednesday. [nL8N1WJ3YI]

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields
rose sharply on Thursday after solid U.S. economic data sent
Treasury yields to multi-year peaks and bolstered the case for
interest rate hikes in the world's largest economy.     
    Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields on Wednesday had recorded
their biggest one-day rise since the day after Donald Trump was
elected president after U.S. services sector activity raced to a
21-year high in September. [nL2N1WJ0I1] 
    Later the same day, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome
Powell hailed a ""remarkably positive outlook"" for the U.S.
economy. [nL2N1WI119]  
    As the effects of a swelling U.S. economy are likely to send
ripples through the world, most euro zone bond yields played
catch up on Thursday, rising across the board to their highest
levels in months in some cases. 
    The exception was Italy, where yields extended falls seen
the previous day when leading government figures offered
soothing words on the trajectory for the country's debt.
    In the United States, Fed Chairman Powell said the central
bank may raise rates above an estimated ""neutral"" setting as the
""remarkably positive"" U.S. economy continues to grow. 
    ""If the Fed is to hike rates beyond the neutral level, the
underlying case is that the economy is doing very well - and if
the U.S. economy is doing very well, that has spillover effects
the euro zone,"" said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht. 
    ""This will make it easier for the ECB to raise rates in
2019; and you will see this impact yields in the euro zone,
especially at the long end,"" he added. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield <DE10YT=RR>, the benchmark for
the region, hit a 4-1/2 month high of 0.55 percent before
settling at around 0.53 percent, still up six basis points on
the day. 
    Other euro zone bond yields were up between two and five bps
across the board, with French and Spanish borrowing costs
hitting their highest levels in around four months. <FR10YT=RR>
<ES10YT=RR>
    This came as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed another 5
bps on Thursday morning to a fresh seven-year peak of 3.23
percent. <US10YT=RR> 
    The ""transatlantic spread"" between United States and German
10-year bond yields hit a three decade high of around 275 bps. 
    While this spread is not useful in absolute terms, as the
debt is denominated in different currencies, many investors
watch it as an indicator of diverging monetary policy stances
between the two regions. 
    
    BUCKING THE TREND
    With yields rising all around, Italian borrowing costs
dropped on Thursday, adding to the previous day's sharp
declines, after Italy said it would cut budget deficit targets
from 2020 and reduce its debt over the next three years.
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a
deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2019 and said this would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8
percent in 2021. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    The estimates for 2020 and 2021 were lower than those
initially reported, bringing further relief to bond markets
rattled by the new government's plans to ramp up spending.
    ""It's a sign that the moderate forces in the coalition --
namely Conte and (Economy Minister) Tria -- are trying to calm
investors' nerves and they still have something to say within
the government. This is positive for Italy,"" said Albrecht of DZ
Bank.  
    Italian bond yields were down as much as 7-8 basis points in
early trade before pulling back as bond yields across the euro
zone rose following a sharp overnight sell off in the U.S.
Treasury market.
    Italy's two-year bond yield was last down 2 basis points at
1.19 percent <IT2YT=RR>.
    The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields
<IT10YT=RR>, <DE10YT=RR> was at 281 bps, down from just over 300
bps earlier this week.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> is
being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over a 200
billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal involving
its Estonian branch, confirming long-held investor fears.  
    Denmark's largest bank said in a statement on Thursday that
it had ""received requests for information from the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) in connection with a criminal
investigation relating to the bank's Estonian branch"".
    The bank, which this week appointed Jesper Nielsen as
interim chief executive to handle the growing crisis after the
resignation last month of Thomas Borgen, said it was cooperating
with the U.S. authorities.[nGNE9wcTG0] [nL8N1WH15W]
    Shares in Danske Bank fell by three percent to 160 Danish
crowns, their lowest level since January 2015 and a 33 percent
decline so far this year, as investors digested the latest
developments at the bank. [nL8N1WK1H2]
    Shareholders have fretted for months over the possibility of
U.S. authorities investigating whether Danske Bank broke U.S.
rules in allowing payments through its Estonian operation
because of the potential for significant penalties.
    France's BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> reached a record $8.9 billion
settlement with U.S. authorities in 2015 to resolve claims that
it violated sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.
    Many of the non-resident accounts at Denmark's Estonia
branch were held by entities or individuals in Russia, which is
the subject of sanctions by the United States.
    Banks doing business in Estonia handled more than $1
trillion in cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, the
country's central bank said on Wednesday. [nL8N1WJ3YI]
    Sweden's Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> said on Thursday there were ""no
ongoing investigations"" into its anti-money laundering practices
by any of its regulators. [nFWN1WK093]     
    
    WIDENING NET    
    In a sign of the impact criminal and regulatory
investigations in Estonia, Denmark and the Britain are having on
the lender, Danske Bank said it would end its share buyback
programme after reassessing its capital targets.
    It had initially planned to buy shares back worth 10 billion
Danish crowns ($1.5 billion) under the programme, which should
have run until Feb 1 next year. It had repurchased shares worth
6.8 billion under the programme as of the end of last week.
    This followed an assessment by Denmark's Financial Services
Authority which said Danske Bank's compliance and reputational
risks were now higher than previously thought in May. 
    The FSA did not mention the U.S. authorities in its 12 page
follow-up report published via Danske Bank on Thursday.
    The FSA said in May that the bank's Pillar II capital
requirements should increase by 5 billion Danish crowns but it
has now ordered Danske to reassess its solvency need ""with a
view to increase the add-on to an absolute minimum of 10 billion
crowns"".
    The bank has therefore raised its CET1 capital ratio target
to around 16 percent from a target of 14-15 percent and its
total capital ratio to be above 20 percent from an earlier
target of above 19 percent.
    By end of the second quarter the bank's CET1 ratio stood at
15.9 percent and its total capital ratio stood at 21.6 percent.
    Last month the bank said in an internal report commissioned
by Borgen that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many of
which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through its
tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. [nL8N1WB33L]
    The findings of the report led to Borgen taking ""ultimate 
responsibility"" and stepping down, although he says he was
cleared from a legal point of view, and prompted regulators
across the European Union to question their oversight.
    Politicians in Europe are calling for stricter measures to
prevent money laundering in the bloc's banks, after Dutch
financial group ING <INGA.AS> was fined 775 million euros last
month after admitting criminals had been able to launder cash
through its accounts. [nL8N1VQ0IK][nL8N1WB4QK]

    BERLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A significant slowdown in private
investment is a weak spot for the German economy, the BdB
banking association said on Thursday, slightly lowering it 2019
growth forecast for Europe's largest economy on trade frictions
and weak emerging markets.
    The association said it expected the economy to grow by 1.8
percent, down from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent. The BdB
expects a growth rate of 1.9 percent this year.
    ""Given the escalating trade conflict and the difficulties
facing some emerging countries, the world economy faces the
threat of sliding toward dangerous territory,"" BdB Managing
Director Christian Ossig said in a statement.
    ""We assume that the risks will remain manageable,"" he said,
adding that the German economy should remain stable despite
growth rates lower than last year's 2.2 percent.
    The German economy has been relying on private consumption
and government spending for growth as exports weaken. The
services sector has been providing a cushion against slowing
manufacturing output. 
    The German government last month also lowered its growth
forecast for this year to around 2.0 percent, saying companies
were not investing enough to achieve higher growth rates because
they lacked skilled workers to increase their output.
    ""Judging by the profits of companies, high capacity
utilisation, persistent economic growth and very low interest
rates, investments should have increased much more strongly,""
Ossig said.
    The BdB has also lowered its forecasts for private
investments in machinery and construction for both 2018 and
2019. It expects investments in machinery to grow by 3.1 percent
next year, down from a previous forecast of 3.6.
    It said the European Central Bank needed to put an end to
its negative interest rate policy.

    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Danish bank said
it faces a U.S. criminal probe over suspicious payments in
Estonia. That raises the risk that it could be blacklisted in
America, which sank Latvian peer ABLV, or be fined. Even a
plausible $5 bln hit would send Danske’s capital ratio below its
minimum level.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Danske Bank announced on Oct. 4 that it is in talks with
the U.S. Department of Justice in relation to a criminal
investigation into the bank’s Estonia branch which processed 200
billion euros of potentially suspicious payments between 2007
and 2015.
    - “We are cooperating with the authorities investigating us
as a result of the case. However, it is too early to speculate
on any outcome of the investigations,” interim CEO Jesper
Nielsen said in a statement. 
    - Separately, Denmark’s largest bank by assets disclosed
that it would end its 10 billion crown ($1.5 billion) share
buyback programme after the country’s Financial Supervisory
Authority said it must increase its common equity Tier 1 capital
by the same amount “in order to ensure an adequate capital
coverage of increased compliance and reputational risks”.
    - As a result, Danske Bank said its targeted CET1 capital
ratio would increase to 16 percent from a previous target of
between 14 and 15 percent. The lender’s CET1 ratio was 15.9
percent at the end of June.

    By Teis Jensen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> faces
a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice over
a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money laundering scandal
involving its Estonian branch, increasing long-held investor
fears.  
    Denmark's largest bank said on Thursday that it had
""received requests for information from the U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ) in connection with a criminal investigation
relating to the bank's Estonian branch"".
    The bank, which this week appointed Jesper Nielsen as
interim chief executive to handle the crisis in the short term 
after the resignation last month of Thomas Borgen, said it was
cooperating with the U.S. authorities.[nGNE9wcTG0] [nL8N1WH15W]
    Shares in Danske Bank fell by three percent to 160 Danish
crowns, their lowest level since January 2015 and a 33 percent
decline so far this year, as its investors and customers
digested the U.S. investigation and the bank's decision to halt
a share buyback programme to bolster its capital. [nL8N1WK1H2]
    The mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen, said the Danish
capital was looking into ending its cooperation with Danske Bank
as a result of the unfolding scandal. 
    Shareholders have fretted for months over the possibility of
U.S. authorities investigating whether Danske Bank broke U.S.
rules in allowing payments through its Estonian operation
because of the potential for significant penalties.
    ""We think a fine of $6 billion, unlikely in our view given
no sanctions/terror violations have been uncovered as yet after
investigating high-risk customers, is already reflected in the
price,"" Jefferies analyst Kapilan Pillai said in a note. 
    France's BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> reached a record $8.9 billion
settlement with U.S. authorities in 2015 to resolve claims that
it violated sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.
    Many of the non-resident accounts at Denmark's Estonian
branch were held by entities or individuals in Russia, which is
the subject of U.S. sanctions.
    Banks doing business in Estonia handled more than $1
trillion in cross-border flows between 2008 and 2017, the
country's central bank said on Wednesday. [nL8N1WJ3YI]
    Sweden's Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> said on Thursday there were ""no
ongoing investigations"" into its anti-money laundering
practices. Nordea <NDAFI.HE>, the Nordic region's biggest bank,
also said it is not under investigation over alleged money
laundering in the Baltics.[nFWN1WK093] [nL8N1WK2CS]     
    
    WIDENING NET    
    In a sign of the impact criminal and regulatory
investigations in Estonia, Denmark, Britain and now the United
States are having on the lender, Danske Bank said it would end
its share buybacks after reassessing its capital targets.
    It had initially planned to buy shares back worth 10 billion
Danish crowns ($1.5 billion) under the programme, which should
have run until February next year. It had repurchased shares
worth 6.8 billion as of the end of last week.
    This followed an assessment by Denmark's Financial Services
Authority which said Danske Bank's compliance and reputational
risks had risen. It did not mention the U.S. inquiry in a 12
page follow-up report published by Danske Bank.
    The FSA said in May that Danske Bank's Pillar II capital
requirements should rise by 5 billion Danish crowns but has now
ordered it to double this to a minimum of 10 billion crowns.
    The bank raised its CET1 capital ratio target to around 16
percent from a 14-15 percent target and its total capital ratio
to be above 20 percent from an earlier target of above 19
percent.
    By end of the second quarter the bank's CET1 ratio stood at
15.9 percent and its total capital ratio stood at 21.6 percent.
    ""It is a signal from our side that we would rather be on the
safe side, rather than being seen on the other side, when it
comes to capital,"" Morten Mosegaard, Danske Bank's interim chief
financial officer and chief of staff told Reuters.
    Last month the bank said in an internal report commissioned
by Borgen that payments totalling 200 billion euros, many of
which it described as ""suspicious"", had been moved through its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. [nL8N1WB33L]
    The findings of the report led to Borgen taking ""ultimate 
responsibility"", although he says he was cleared from a legal
point of view, and prompted renewed action by regulators.
    The Danish bank's board has asked Denmark's FSA to approve
the appointment of its head of wealth management Jacob
Aarup-Andersen as its new chief executive, Danish online media
Finans reported, citing several unnamed sources. 
    The FSA is due to make a decision next week, Finans
reported. The FSA and Danske Bank declined to comment.
    Politicians in Europe are calling for stricter measures to
prevent money laundering after Dutch financial group ING
<INGA.AS> was fined 775 million euros last month after admitting
criminals had been able to launder cash through its accounts.

reduce the amount of interest payments and accounting losses
that banks can deduct from their taxable income as part of
measures to fund next year's budget, a government source said.
    The source said it was possible that such a move, which was
first reported by Il Sole 24 Ore daily, could be included in the
budget law for 2019.
    Banks would only be able to deduct 85 percent of interest
payments from their tax base and would have to spread writedown
losses stemming from the newly introduced IFRS9 accounting rule
over a period of two to 10 years, the paper said.
    The source also confirmed that the government was
considering scrapping tax incentives introduced by the previous
executive to spur companies' capital levels, known as 'Allowance
for Corporate Equity' or ACE.

    THE HAGUE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Dutch authorities disrupted an
attempt in April by Russian intelligence agents to hack the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Defence
Minister Ank Bijleveld said.
    At a press conference in the Hague, Bijleveld called on
Russia to cease its cyber activities aimed at ""undermining""
Western democracies.
    According to a presentation by the head of the Netherlands'
military intelligence agency, four Russians arrived in the
Netherlands on April 10 and were caught with spying equipment at
a hotel located next to the OPCW headquarters.
    At the time, the OPCW was working to verify the identity of
the substance used in the March attack in Salisbury, Britain, on
former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia. It was
also seeking to verify the identity of a substance used in an
attack in Douma, Syria.
    The four Russians in the Netherlands were detained on April
13 and expelled to Russia, Dutch Major General Onno Eichelsheim
said. They had planned to travel on to a laboratory in Spiez,
Switzerland used by the OPCW to analyse chemical weapons
samples, he said.
    Russian military intelligence ""is active here in the
Netherlands ... where a lot of international organisations are""
based, Eichelsheim said.

 (Adds graphic, updates prices)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields
rose sharply on Thursday after U.S. economic data bolstered the
case for interest rate hikes in the world's largest economy and
sent Treasury yields to multi-year peaks.
    Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields recorded their biggest one-day
rise on Wednesday since Donald Trump was elected president,
after U.S. services sector activity raced to a 21-year high in
September. [nL2N1WJ0I1] 
    U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had also talked
of a ""remarkably positive outlook"" for the U.S. economy.
[nL2N1WI119]  
    Most euro zone bond yields played catch up on Thursday,
rising across the board to their highest levels in months in
some cases.
    Italian bond yields had initially bucked this trend and
fallen after the government moderated contentious spending
plans, but this changed as the session wore on as a report
suggested the EU was poised to reject Rome's budget plans.
[nL8N1WK1DM]
    Fed Chairman Powell said the central bank may raise rates
above an estimated ""neutral"" setting.
    ""If the Fed is to hike rates beyond the neutral level, the
underlying case is that the economy is doing very well - and if
the U.S. economy is doing very well, that has spillover effects
in the euro zone,"" said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht. 
    ""This will make it easier for the ECB to raise rates in
2019; and you will see this impact yields in the euro zone,
especially at the long end,"" he added. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield <DE10YT=RR>, the benchmark for
the region, hit a 4-1/2 month high of 0.55 percent before
settling at around 0.53 percent, still up six basis points on
the day. 
    Other euro zone bond yields were up between three and five
bps across the board, with French and Spanish borrowing costs
hitting their highest levels in around four months. <FR10YT=RR>
<ES10YT=RR>
    This came as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed another 5
bps on Thursday morning to a fresh seven-year peak of 3.23
percent. <US10YT=RR> 
    The ""transatlantic spread"" between United States and German
10-year bond yields hit a three decade high of around 275 bps. 
    While this spread is not useful in absolute terms, as the
debt is denominated in different currencies, many investors
watch it as an indicator of diverging monetary policy stances
between the two regions. 
    
    ITALIAN CAUTION
    Italian borrowing costs initially fell on Thursday, adding
to the previous day's sharp declines, after Italy said it would
cut budget deficit targets from 2020 and reduce its debt over
the next three years. 
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a
deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2019 and said this would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8
percent in 2021. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But on Thursday morning, la Repubblica newspaper said in an
unsourced report that the European Commission has already
prepared a letter to open an infraction procedure against the
Italian government for its plans to increase deficit spending
next year. 
    Italian bond yields, having fallen between seven and eight
basis points in early trade, were back up again.
    Italy's 10-year yield was up five bps to 3.36 percent and
the spread over Germany was 282 bps by midday London time.

    PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Western European car sales dropped
23 percent in September, according to LMC Automotive data, in
the wake of a summer discounting splurge that preceded tougher
new emissions rules now keeping some models out of showrooms.
    Registrations fell to 1.05 million cars last month from 1.36
million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Thursday.
Its numbers are based on national sales data and estimates for
some of the smallest markets.
    The new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP)
became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> and Renault <RENA.PA> to halt deliveries
of some models that had yet to be re-certified.
    ""The factors affecting the market are multifaceted, with
backlogs in cars being tested under WLTP leading to the removal
from sale of several popular models,"" said LMC analyst David
Oakley.
    VW, Renault and Fiat Chrysler <FCHA.MI> had led a sales
surge in August, as carmakers boosted discounts and
registrations of their own vehicles to be sold as nearly new on
the used car market. [nL8N1W46LI] [nL5N1VR2IF]
    According to calculations by Citi analysts, VW Group's sales
fell by half in September across Europe's five biggest markets
-- Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain -- while Renault's
dropped 28.7 percent and Fiat Chrysler's 32.1 percent.
    The seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of Western
European sales plunged 39 percent from August to 11.26 million
cars last month, LMC said - adding that VW model approval delays
had contributed to market declines in Germany and the UK.
    Total sales fell 30.5 percent in Germany, 20.5 percent in
Britain, 12.8 percent in France and 25.4 percent in Italy,
according to data published in recent days.

seen its economy start to recover in the past three years after
years of decline due to wars and isolation in the 1990s,
followed by the 2008 global financial crisis.   
    ""Strong macroeconomic performance continues. Growth
accelerated in 2018 supported by private consumption and strong
investment and exports,"" James Roaf, the head of the Fund's
mission told a news conference after a two-week visit to
Belgrade. 
    The IMF expects Serbia's economy to grow 3.5 percent in
2019.   
    The Washington-based lender also reviewed a 30-month
non-financial, advisory and monitoring arrangement (PCI) agreed
with Serbia in June, which is tailored for countries that do not
need financial support. Serbia needs the arrangement to bolster
investor confidence. 
    Roaf said the mission and the Serbian government had also
agreed a 2019 fiscal deficit target of 0.5 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP). According to Finance Ministry data,
Serbia currently maintains a 0.6 percent budget surplus.
    The public debt of the European Union applicant country is
expected to shrink to around 55 percent of GDP by the end of
2018, from around 70 percent at the beginning of 2015 when
Belgrade and the IMF agreed a 1.2 billion euro loan deal. 
    The arrangement expired in February without Serbia drawing
funds from it.
    ""In the last few years, Serbia had a huge, dramatic
improvement ... and experienced an increase of growth,"" Roaf
said. 
    Due to the improvement in the economy, the government will
from November abolish pension cuts introduced in 2014 and raise
payments by between 8 percent and 13.2 percent.
    Serbia's headline inflation increased to 2.6 percent in
August but is expected to stay inside the central bank's target
of 3 percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points, in 2018 and
2019.
    Serbia's Finance Minister Sinisa Mali said the government
plans to ease some of the tax burden on labour, make phased
increases in public sector wages and use 208 billion dinars
(1.76 billion euros) for capital investments in 2019. 
    Roaf warned Serbia must complete its structural reforms,
dispose of remaining state-run firms and improve its resiliency
to global risks.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields
rose sharply on Thursday after U.S. economic data bolstered the
case for interest rate hikes in the world's largest economy and
sent Treasury yields to multi-year peaks.
    Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields reached their highest level in
seven years on Thursday, extending a sell-off on Wednesday which
helped the 10-year record its biggest one-day rise since Donald
Trump was elected president, after U.S. services sector activity
raced to a 21-year high in September. [nL2N1WJ0I1] 
    U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had also talked
of a ""remarkably positive outlook"" for the U.S. economy.
[nL2N1WI119]  
    Data on Thursday showed U.S. weekly jobless claims also fell
to near a 49-year low, which also helped add to expectations of
strong U.S. growth. [nL2N1WJ182]
    Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields remained pinned near
seven-year highs on Thursday at 3.20 percent. <US10YT=RR> 
    Most euro zone bond yields played catch up on Thursday,
rising across the board to their highest levels in months in
some cases.
    Italian bond yields had initially bucked this trend and
fallen after the government moderated contentious spending
plans, but this changed as the session wore on as a report
suggested the EU was poised to reject Rome's budget plans.
[nL8N1WK1DM]
    Fed Chairman Powell said the central bank may raise rates
above an estimated ""neutral"" setting.
    ""If the Fed is to hike rates beyond the neutral level, the
underlying case is that the economy is doing very well - and if
the U.S. economy is doing very well, that has spillover effects
in the euro zone,"" said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht. 
    ""This will make it easier for the ECB to raise rates in
2019; and you will see this impact yields in the euro zone,

    Germany's 10-year bond yield <DE10YT=RR>, the benchmark for
the region, hit a 4-1/2 month high of 0.55 percent before
settling at around 0.54 percent, still up five basis points on
the day. 
    Other euro zone bond yields were up between three and five
bps across the board, with French and Spanish borrowing costs
hitting their highest levels in around four months. <FR10YT=RR>

    The ""transatlantic spread"" between United States and German
10-year bond yields hit a three decade high of around 275 bps,
before receding to 267 bps.  
    While this spread is not useful in absolute terms, as the
debt is denominated in different currencies, many investors
watch it as an indicator of diverging monetary policy stances
between the two regions. 
    
    ITALIAN CAUTION
    Italian borrowing costs initially fell on Thursday, adding
to the previous day's sharp declines, after Italy said it would
cut budget deficit targets from 2020 and reduce its debt over
the next three years. 
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday confirmed a
deficit target of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2019 and said this would fall to 2.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8
percent in 2021. [nL8N1WJ0RJ]
    But on Thursday morning, la Repubblica newspaper said in an
unsourced report that the European Commission has already
prepared a letter to open an infraction procedure against the
Italian government for its plans to increase deficit spending
next year. 
    Italian bond yields, having fallen between seven and eight
basis points in early trade, were back up to trade almost flat
to Wednesday's close. 
    Italy's 10-year yield was up two bps to 3.32 percent and the
spread over Germany was 277 bps as trading wound down on
Thursday. <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>

    PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Western European car sales dropped
23 percent in September, according to LMC Automotive data, in
the wake of a summer discounting splurge that preceded tougher
new emissions rules now keeping some models out of showrooms.
    Registrations fell to 1.05 million cars last month from 1.36
million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Thursday.
Its numbers are based on national sales data and estimates for
some of the smallest markets.
    The new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP)
became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> and Renault <RENA.PA> to halt deliveries
of some models that had yet to be re-certified.
    ""The factors affecting the market are multifaceted, with
backlogs in cars being tested under WLTP leading to the removal
from sale of several popular models,"" said LMC analyst David
Oakley.
    VW, Renault and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) <FCHA.MI> had led a
sales surge in August, as carmakers boosted discounts and
registrations of their own vehicles to be sold as nearly new on
the used car market. [nL8N1W46LI] [nL5N1VR2IF]
    Citi analysts calculate that VW Group's sales fell by half
in September across Europe's five biggest markets -- Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Spain -- while Renault's dropped 28.7
percent and Fiat Chrysler's 32.1 percent.
    According to French market data supplied by industry
newsletter AutoActu, models worst hit by September's slump
included the Volkswagen Golf and Touran; Renault's Espace and
Kadjar; alliance partner Nissan's <7201.T> Qashqai SUV; and
FCA's Fiat Tipo and Jeep Renegade.
    The seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of Western
European sales plunged 39 percent from August to 11.26 million
cars last month, LMC said - adding that VW model approval delays
had contributed to market declines in Germany and the UK.
    Total sales fell 30.5 percent in Germany, 20.5 percent in
Britain, 12.8 percent in France and 25.4 percent in Italy,
according to data published in recent days.

    ISTANBUL, Oct 4 (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on
Thursday he would consider putting Turkey's long-stalled bid to
join the European Union to a referendum, signalling exasperation
with a process he says has been waylaid by prejudice against
Muslims.
    A direct vote on whether to continue Turkey's candidacy for
EU membership could potentially end Ankara's negotiations for
accession, which formally began in 2005, and increase its
distance from the West.
    EU countries, particularly Germany, have been critical of
Turkey and Erdogan in the aftermath of an attempted coup in
2016. The sweeping security crackdown that followed the failed
putsch has seen more than 100,000 people jailed and dozens of
media outlets shut down. Erdogan has fumed over what he sees as
a lack of support from the West.
    ""It is 2018 and they (the EU) are still keeping us waiting,""
Erdogan said at a forum in Istanbul. ""It is for us to go to 81
million people and see what decision the 81 million people
give,"" he said, referring to Turkey's electorate.
    He said that if the decision to hold a referendum were
taken, measures could be taken ""immediately"". 
    ""Let's put it on the table with colleagues and discuss it as
party chairman and after that, the moment one has said 'ok' we
will immediately take our step,"" he said.
    ""There are European countries where they squeeze two or
three referendums into one year. Actually, one has to get used
to referendums.""
    Erdogan, whose roots are in political Islam, has long
accused EU member states of harbouring anti-Muslim sentiment,
saying that the bloc is uneasy at the prospect of having a
majority Muslim country as a member.
    Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok, on a visit to Ankara on
Wednesday, said Turkey must address issues around the rule of
law and human rights to make progress on EU accession possible.

    PRAGUE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman said
on Thursday he would appoint economist Ales Michl to the board
of the Czech National Bank.
    Michl would replace one of the two current vice-governors on
the seven-seat board of the Czech central bank who will complete
their terms at the end of November.
    Michl worked for almost a decade until 2015 as an investment
strategist at Raiffeisenbank, the Czech unit of Austrian bank
Raiffeisen. He went on to found an investment group that uses
algorithms to invest in U.S. shares and bonds.
    ""I assume that two members of the board, including Ales
Michl, will be appointed on November 21,"" Zeman said in a weekly
interview aired by private TV Barrandov.
    Zeman declined to name the other person he had picked to
join the central bank board.
    Outgoing vice-governors Vladimir Tomsik and Mojmir Hampl are
the last board members appointed by the previous president,
Vaclav Klaus, who favoured more eurosceptic economists than
Zeman.
    The central bank advises the government on the country's
eventual adoption of the common euro currency, that it committed
to when joining the European Union in 2004. Prague currently has
no target date for adopting the euro.
    Governor Jiri Rusnok, an economic adviser to Zeman, has sat
on the board since 2014 and led it since 2016.
    The central bank scrapped an intervention regime keeping the
crown weak in 2017 after using it for almost four years, part of
efforts to revive inflation after the country went through two
recessions following the global financial crisis a decade ago.
    Since letting the crown float free again, the bank has been
the most aggressive in the EU in normalising policy by raising
its main interest rate <CZCBIR=ECI> in six steps to 1.50
percent, including hikes at its past three meetings.[nL8N1WC446]

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The euro languished near a
seven-week low on Tuesday as concerns about a row in the
European Union over Italy's budget persisted.
    The euro has tended not to budge in response to spikes in
Italian bond yields triggered by developments in the dispute,
with investors judging that Rome's spending plans will not
impact the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
    But the threat of a showdown along with weakness in stock
markets worldwide has seen traders who had bet on a fourth
quarter euro rebound ditch the single currency. 
    The euro <EUR=EBS> fell 0.2 percent to $1.1465, close to a
seven-week low of $1.146 reached during the previous session. 
    Italian government bond yields meanwhile edged down from 
4-1/2-year highs on hopes that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
will strike a moderate tone when defending the government's
budget in parliament. 
    ""In light of current levels of stress in the Italian
markets, the question now is how far the Bund/BTP yield gaps can
blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,""
said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister on Monday denounced European
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Economics
Commissioner Pierre Moscovici as enemies of Europe.  
    Derrick said increasingly it was the dollar rather than the
Swiss franc that was benefiting from safe-haven trades in
response to the concerns over Italy.  
    Against the Swiss franc <EURCHF=EBS>, the euro gained 0.1
percent to 1.1414 <EURCHF=EBS>.  
    Ten-year Treasury yields resumed their steep climb to
seven-year highs on Tuesday. That helped the dollar strengthen
across the board with only Japan's yen outperforming among the
major currencies.
    Against a basket of its rivals <.DXY>, the greenback rose
0.2 percent to 95.933, not far off a seven-week top of 96.127
hit last week.
    The Chinese offshore yuan <CNY=D4> was slightly stronger on

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a seven-week low
on Tuesday as the dollar rose broadly and concerns persisted
about a row in the European Union over Italy's budget.
    The euro has tended not to budge in response to spikes in
Italian bond yields triggered by developments in the dispute,
with investors judging that Rome's spending plans will not
impact the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
    But the threat of a showdown along with weakness in stock
markets worldwide has seen traders who had bet on a fourth
quarter euro rebound ditch the single currency. 
    The euro <EUR=EBS> fell 0.4 percent to $1.1444, its lowest
since Aug. 20. 
    ""Concerns over Italy have largely remained contained,
dampening downside risks for the euro in the near-term, but it
may not remain that way if Italian risks continue to escalate,""
said analysts at MUFG. 
    The dollar strengthened across the board helped by U.S.
Treasury yields resuming their steep climb to seven-year highs.
Only Japan's yen outperformed the dollar among the major
currencies.
    Against a basket of its rivals <.DXY>, the greenback rose
0.3 percent to 96.081, not far off a seven-week top of 96.127
hit last week.
    Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria struck a resolute
tone on his controversial budget plans in Rome's parliament and
that saw Italy's benchmark 10-year government bond yield move
towards a 4-1/2-year high. [GVD/EUR]
    ""In light of current levels of stress in the Italian
markets, the question now is how far the Bund/BTP yield gaps can
blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,""
said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
    Italy's Deputy Prime Minister on Monday denounced European
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Economics
Commissioner Pierre Moscovici as enemies of Europe.  
    Derrick said increasingly it was the dollar rather than the
Swiss franc that was benefiting from safe-haven trades in
response to the concerns over Italy.  
    Against the Swiss franc <EURCHF=EBS>, the euro gained 0.2
percent to 1.1376 <EURCHF=EBS>.  
    The Chinese offshore yuan <CNY=D4> was slightly weaker on
the day at 6.9350 yuan per dollar. It recovered somewhat after
slipping about 0.35 percent overnight.
    At the weekend, China's central bank moved to inject more
liquidity into the financial system as policymakers worried
about the economic impact of a heated trade row with the United

economy to grow 2.2 percent in 2019 and the budget deficit to
all but disappear, a lawmaker said on Tuesday after meeting the
finance minister about next year's budget plans.
    Andre Silva of the small PAN party, who was the first to
meet with minister Mario Centeno in a round of consultations in
parliament, told reporters the government was aiming to slash
the budget deficit to 0-0.2 percent next year after this year's
projected 0.7 percent. 
    ""Growth is expected to be around 2.2 percent, unemployment
at 6 percent, and public debt cut to 117 percent of GDP,"" Silva
said. That would put growth in line with this year's estimated
expansion.
    ""The minister did not give a precise deficit figure, but it
is expected to be between zero and 0.2 percent, that big a cut,""
he added.
    Portugal expects to finish this year with a debt-to-GDP
ratio of 121.2 percent as it continues to retreat from record
highs of more than 130 percent two years ago.
    The government has to present the draft budget to parliament
by Oct. 15. Meeting this year's 0.7 percent target would mean a
record low deficit in over four decades of the country's
democratic history. And it would come just four years after
Portugal exited an international bailout.
    Although the growth forecast is a tad lower than 2.3 percent
expected previously, it is well above the International Monetary
Fund's latest projection of 1.8 percent, released earlier on
Tuesday as part of its global economic growth forecasts.
    Last year the economy grew 2.7 percent - its strongest pace
since 2000.
    Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week the 2019 draft
budget would target a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP, confirming
an earlier plan released in April which was criticised by his
leftist allies, who want more spending on healthcare and civil
servant wages rather than focusing on deficit cuts.
    Since coming to power in late 2015, Costa's government has
managed to combine fiscal discipline with measures to support
growth, while reversing most of the austerity policies imposed
by a centre-right administration during the 2010-14 debt crisis.

    By Michelle Martin
    BERLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - German firms would face extra
tariffs of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) a year if
Britain quits the European Union without a trade deal, and their
exports to Britain might drop by up to 57 percent, Germany's IW
institute said on Tuesday.
    Talks on ending four decades of Britain's membership in the
European Union have entered their final stage more than two
years after Britons voted for Brexit. A hard Brexit would mean
Britain leaving the bloc with no trade deal.
    The BDI industry association - one of Germany's most
influential lobby groups - said a breakthrough in Brexit
negotiations was needed at an Oct. 17-18 summit in Brussels.
    ""Otherwise there is the risk that Europe slides into a
disorderly Brexit and that would cause a huge crisis,"" Managing
Director Joachim Lang told a news conference in Berlin.
    A hard Brexit would cause huge difficulties for tens of
thousands of companies in Europe and hundreds of thousands of
employees in Britain and the European Union, Lang said.
    He noted that many companies were preparing for a hard
Brexit and some wanted to suspend production in Britain from
April as delivery routes could not be secured and some were
moving their headquarters from Britain, adjusting their legal
frameworks and looking for new transport routes.
    Lang said there was no overall figure for how much companies
had spent on preparing for Brexit but some individual
pharmaceutical and chemical companies had spent up to 100
million pounds ($130 million) preparing for Brexit.
    
    AUTO SECTOR TO SUFFER
    A hard Brexit would affect the auto sector - which employs
some 800,000 people in Germany and is the country's biggest
exporter - particularly hard as it would be hit with about 60
percent of the extra costs German companies would face, IW said.
    About 5 percent of Germany's gross domestic product depended

    In the long term, a hard Brexit would probably result in
price rises and a shift in Germany's flow of goods, the IW said.
    Lang said a transition period, which would only be possible
with a Brexit deal, was indispensable to enable German companies
to adapt to the changes to the legal framework that would come
afterwards.
    ""A strong agreement with the EU is far more important for
both sides, especially for Britain, than the remote prospect of
deals with third countries,"" he said.

recommending Warsaw quits a U.N. migration pact before its final
approval as it may encourage more illegal migrants, the ministry
said on Tuesday.
    Hungary has already announced it will not sign up to the
Global Compact For Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which
was approved in July by all 193 U.N. member nations except the
United States, which pulled out last year. 
    The pact, due to be adopted in December, addresses issues
including why people migrate, how to protect them and how to
integrate them into new countries.
    Poland, along with Hungary and Czech Republic, has taken a
tough stand against resettling migrants, putting it at odds with
the European Union, but striking a chord with voters by arguing
that irregular immigration threatens European stability.    
    ""I will recommend to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to
opt out from the Global Compact (GCM) deal, which is due to be
signed in December in Marrakech,"" Joachim Brudzinski was quoted
by the Interior Ministry Twitter feed as saying.
    ""In our opinion the draft of the agreement does not
guarantee Poland's safety. It may also encourage illegal
immigration.""
    The government's press office had no immediate comment on
the recommendation.
    Brudzinski was speaking at the G6 summit in Lyon, France, 
where he met his Italian counterpart Matteo Salvini, among
others, the ministry tweeted. Brudzinski retweeted the Tweet.
    Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party
built its 2015 parliamentary election landslide victory in part
on kindling the fear of migrants. That year, Europe saw the
biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War Two.
    Nonetheless, Poland, with a population of 38-million people
and record low unemployment of 5.8 percent, has taken in a large
influx of foreign workers, mainly from Ukraine, but also from
Belarus and parts of Asia, as the fast developing economy
struggles with a lack of workers.

    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Some Italian banks may be forced to
tap investors for cash if the risk that premium domestic bonds
pay over safer German Bunds rises above certain levels, a top
central bank official warned.
    Market concerns over the fiscal profligacy of Italy's new
anti-establishment government have driven the 10-year yield gap
between Italy and Germany above 300 basis points, from 130 in
mid-May before the new coalition's spending plans first leaked.
    ""There are (spread) levels that may force some banks to tap
markets (for cash),"" Bank of Italy Deputy Director General Luigi
Federico Signorini told a parliamentary hearing.
    Filling capital shortfalls could prove difficult for Italian
lenders, which have come under heavy pressure due to their large
holdings of domestic government bonds. [nL8N1WH52F]
    Credit Suisse analysts said on Monday a widening of the
yield differential between Italian and German bonds above 400 
basis points would not be sustainable and would trigger capital
increases.
    Italian lenders have tapped markets in recent years to fund 
a restructuring after a deep recession.
    But weak profitability and growing uncertainty over the
country's prospects could make it hard for them to lure
investors despite extremely cheap market valuations.     
    Signorini also flagged the risk that banks face constraints
in lending because the falling value of their government bond
holdings erode their capital buffers.
    ""The falling value of the government bonds they hold impacts
banks' capital levels. Above a certain threshold, it may hamper
their ability to provide credit to the economy,"" he said.
    Domestic bonds account on average for 10 percent of Italian
banks' overall assets.

 (Recasts after budget speech)
    By Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries
    DUBLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Ireland's finance minister boosted
the country's war chest by raising extra revenue for the second
budget in a row, amid warnings from the state's fiscal watchdog
that the booming economy does not need such additional stimulus.
    Having already pre-committed 2.6 billion euros on increased
public sector and planned infrastructure spending for next year,
Paschal Donohoe, in the annual budget speech, almost doubled the
remaining pot to 1.5 billion euros to dish out on further tax
cuts and spending increases.
    With an election potentially looming and the fast growing
economy exacerbating deficits in areas such as housing, a
scrapping of a reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector
primarily funded the extra spending. 
    That allowed the government to keep giving workers a small
annual tax break it has promised to continue in future budgets,
reverse welfare cuts imposed during a series of savage austerity
budgets a decade ago and boost infrastructure spending.
    ""The shared progress we have made is real. However, the
risks and challenges that we now face are equally real,"" Donohoe
told parliament in a speech that also struck a tone of caution
around neighbouring Britain.
    ""Brexit, the outcome of which is still unclear, edges closer
each day. Increasing trade barriers are raising the spectre of
protectionism and the international tax landscape is changing
rapidly.""
    Donohoe said the government's ""central case"" is that a
Brexit deal will be reached in the coming weeks between Britain
and the European Union, but that the possibility of a no deal
outcome had influenced the financial decisions made.
    A further round of ""Brexit-proofing"" measures that have had
mixed results to date were announced including a 300 million
euro loan scheme for small and medium sized businesses and the
agriculture and food sectors to invest in future growth.
[nL8N1WM0OI]
    Donohoe said the best preparation for Brexit was responsible
budgeting and he intends to balance the state's books for the
first time in more than a decade next year, an improvement on
the tiny deficit originally planned but still not the surplus
the central bank says should already be running. [nL8N1WL4NS]
    The state's independent fiscal watchdog, set up in response
to the years of reckless spending that left the Irish exchequer
massively exposed when the 2008 financial crisis hit, voiced
concerns ahead of the budget over what its chairman has called
the ""not very good budgetary practice"" of recent years.
    It is particularly worried by successive years of spending
coming in over budget, with this year's 700 million euro or 4.5
percent estimated overrun in the health service equivalent to
almost the entire budget day spending package laid out a year
ago.

    LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - For Italy's sovereign debt the
timing could hardly be worse: A budget standoff with Brussels is
driving the country's bond yields to new peaks, just as two
credit agencies are weighing whether to cut their ratings to
within one notch of 'junk'.
    But as markets move to price in chances of the euro zone's
biggest sovereign bond market losing its investment grade
rating, major bond investors reckon political factors and
significant contagion risk make that almost inconceivable.
    Moody's and S&P Global, both rating Italy two rungs above
'junk', are widely expected to downgrade in late October as the
new government's outsize spending plans put it on a collision
course with EU authorities. 
    One rung lower and Italy would fall below investment grade
for the first time, a move that would potentially cost it
hundreds of billions of euros in lost bond investments.
    The conundrum for financial investors is how to accurately
price the risk of a euro zone sovereign in junk territory -
given that particular sovereign's market footprint, the
complication of still-active European Central Bank bond buying,
eligibility rules for that ECB support and an outside risk to
Italy's euro membership.    
    
    HOW WIDE IS TOO WIDE?
    Some think current Italian government benchmark bond spreads
- which hit a five-year high of 312 basis points over German
Bunds on Tuesday - and credit default swaps pricing already show
the country trading as a junk-rated borrower. 
    Kaspar Hense, portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management,
said an Italy/Germany 10-year spread of 300 basis points was
more compatible with a junk-rated issuer, based on a model
comparing Italy with other developed and emerging market
sovereigns. 
    The main credit agencies say their rating decisions are
guided solely by credit analysis and not any wider political
backdrop.
    But investors are wary that current debt pricing comparisons
may be misleading as they don't account for political
sensitivities, given the sheer scale of Italy's bond market and
its systemic importance to the euro zone project.
    ""A downgrade to junk could trigger a full-blown (euro zone)
crisis,"" said Nicola Mai, a portfolio manager at PIMCO, the
world's largest bond investor. ""...Which is why I don't the
agencies will do it, I don't think they will want to be the ones
causing a crisis in Europe.""
    Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan
Asset Management - another bulge bracket bond investor - also
said a junk-rated Italy was highly unlikely. 
    ""It would be a very, very big decision, just given the size
of the Italian bond market, it makes up something like a fifth
of government bonds in the euro zone,"" he said. 
    
    That backdrop suggests the bar is higher for Rome than other
borrowers, and the possibility of a junk rating is therefore
only partially factored in.
    Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said last
month in separate notes they reckoned full pricing in would
equate to an Italy/Germany yield spread of 400 bps.
    At the height of the euro zone debt crisis the spread went
even higher, to over 550 basis points, and the country still
kept its investment grade ratings - though that was without the
effect of the ECB's bond-buying scheme.
    However the numbers are parsed, anxiety over the ratings
risk is likely to persist.
    ""The threat of a junk rating won't go away while the current
coalition is in partnership,"" said John Taylor, fixed income
portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, a fund with $546 billion
of assets under management.             
        
    WHAT'S AT STAKE
    Italy comprises about 22 percent of the 1.346 trillion euro
iBoxx EUR Eurozone index, 5.7 percent of $1.35 trillion ICE
BofAML Global Government Index and 7.53 percent FTSE Russell
World Government Bond Index, which is tracked by $800 billion of
assets. 
    Most major indexes, such as iBoxx and the Bloomberg/Barclays
euro aggregate index, which has a market value of over 10
trillion euros ($11.8 trillion), use the average ratings of
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. 
    So downgrades to junk from two of these agencies would be
enough to take Italy out of these indexes. 
    The ECB, on the other hand, would require all three major
agencies plus DBRS to cut to junk to take Italy out of its
bond-buying programme.
    This issue becomes sharper as the ECB unwinds the programme
this year. When Portugal was merely faced with the threat of
that fourth downgrade from DBRS in August 2016 -- it never
actually came to pass -- its 10-year bond yield spread over
Germany widened 80 basis points in just under two months. 
    Given the complexities and sensitivities, some feel they may
just kick any decision far down the road.
    ""The ratings agencies will give an issuer as influential as
Italy a lot of time,"" said Stealey of JP Morgan AM.

expected on Tuesday to reject the official candidate to head its
central bank after most parties gave him the thumbs-down in a
parliamentary debate.
    Primoz Dolenc, who has been the bank's deputy governor since
2016, was nominated for the top job last month by President
Borut Pahor.
    But Jozef Horvat, of opposition party conservative New
Slovenia, told parliament he believed Dolenc's record at the
bank meant his credentials were lacking.
    ""It is our belief that the Bank of Slovenia did not perform
its supervisory function (over the country's banking sector)
well ...,"" he told lawmakers.
    Allegations of money laundering have plagued Slovenia's
banking sector since it came close to seeking an international
bailout in 2013.
    Parliamentary parties had previously failed to agree on any
single candidate to succeed former governor Bostjan Jazbec, who
resigned in April to take on a position on the EU's Single
Resolution Board. [nL8N1W52X5]
    Dolenc, 41, needs the backing of at least 46 out of 90
parliamentary members in a secret ballot to be elected. 
    If chosen, he would also sit on the European Central Bank's
governing council.
    If not, Pahor is likely to nominate a new candidate in the
coming weeks. According to Slovenian legislation there is no
deadline by which a new central bank governor has to be elected.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament on
Tuesday rejected Primoz Dolenc as the official candidate to head
its central bank after most parties gave him the thumbs-down in
a debate.
    Dolenc, the bank's deputy governor since 2016, was nominated
for the top job last month by President Borut Pahor but only
received support from 30 parliamentary members with 39 voting
against him. 
    Slovenia lost its vote on the European Central Bank's
governing council in April, when former governor Bostjan Jazbec
resigned to take a position on the EU's Single Resolution Board.
It will regain the vote only after it elects a governor.
    The president is likely to nominate a new candidate in the
coming weeks, although Slovenian law does not set a deadline for
when a new central bank governor must be elected. [nL8N1W52X5]
    Jozef Horvat, of opposition party conservative New Slovenia,
told parliament ahead of the vote he believed Dolenc's record at
the bank showed his credentials were lacking.
    ""It is our belief that the Bank of Slovenia did not perform
its supervisory function (over the country's banking sector)
well ...,"" he told lawmakers.
    Allegations of money laundering have plagued Slovenia's
banking sector since it came close to seeking an international
bailout in 2013.
    Analysts said it will be difficult for Pahor to find a
candidate who will get the necessary support because of the
balance of power in the new parliament elected in June.
    The minority centre-left government, which took power last
month, has been unable to agree on a joint candidate. 
    Even if the five parties of the government coalition, which
hold 43 out of 90 parliamentary seats, agree on a candidate,
that person would also need at least three opposition votes to
be elected.
    ""This vote is not a typical indication of how things will go
in the future since Dolenc did not even enjoy support of the
prime minister's party LMS but it indicates that the government
will find it hard to secure majority in parliament for its
projects,"" Meta Roglic, a political analyst of daily Dnevnik,
told Reuters.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - For Italy's sovereign debt the
timing could hardly be worse: A budget standoff with Brussels is
driving the country's bond yields to new peaks, just as two
credit agencies are weighing whether to cut their ratings to
within one notch of 'junk'.
    But as markets move to price in chances of the euro zone's
biggest sovereign bond market losing its investment grade
rating, major bond investors reckon political factors and
significant contagion risk make that almost inconceivable.
    Moody's and S&P Global, both rating Italy two rungs above
'junk', are widely expected to downgrade in late October as the
new government's outsize spending plans put it on a collision
course with EU authorities. 
    One rung lower and Italy would fall below investment grade
for the first time, a move that would potentially cost it
hundreds of billions of euros in lost bond investments.
    The conundrum for financial investors is how to accurately
price the risk of a euro zone sovereign in junk territory -
given that particular sovereign's market footprint, the
complication of still-active European Central Bank bond buying,
eligibility rules for that ECB support and an outside risk to
Italy's euro membership.    
    
    HOW WIDE IS TOO WIDE?
    Some think current Italian government benchmark bond spreads
- which hit a five-year high of 312 basis points over German
Bunds on Tuesday - and credit default swaps pricing already show
the country trading as a junk-rated borrower. 
    Kaspar Hense, portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management,
said an Italy/Germany 10-year spread of 300 basis points was
more compatible with a junk-rated issuer, based on a model
comparing Italy with other developed and emerging market
sovereigns. 
    The main credit agencies say their rating decisions are
guided solely by credit analysis and not any wider political
backdrop.
    But investors are wary that current debt pricing comparisons
may be misleading as they don't account for political
sensitivities, given the sheer scale of Italy's bond market and
its systemic importance to the euro zone project.
    ""A downgrade to junk could trigger a full-blown (euro zone)
crisis,"" said Nicola Mai, a portfolio manager at PIMCO, the
world's largest bond investor. ""...Which is why I don't the
agencies will do it, I don't think they will want to be the ones
causing a crisis in Europe.""
    Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan
Asset Management - another bulge bracket bond investor - also
said a junk-rated Italy was highly unlikely. 
    ""It would be a very, very big decision, just given the size
of the Italian bond market, it makes up something like a fifth
of government bonds in the euro zone,"" he said. 
    
    That backdrop suggests the bar is higher for Rome than other
borrowers, and the possibility of a junk rating is therefore
only partially factored in.
    Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said last
month in separate notes they reckoned full pricing in would
equate to an Italy/Germany yield spread of 400 bps.
    At the height of the euro zone debt crisis the spread went
even higher, to over 550 basis points, and the country still
kept its investment grade ratings - though that was without the
effect of the ECB's bond-buying scheme.
    However the numbers are parsed, anxiety over the ratings
risk is likely to persist.
    ""The threat of a junk rating won't go away while the current
coalition is in partnership,"" said John Taylor, fixed income
portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, a fund with $546 billion
of assets under management.             
        
    WHAT'S AT STAKE
    Italy comprises about 22 percent of the 1.346 trillion euro
iBoxx EUR Eurozone index, 5.7 percent of $1.35 trillion ICE
BofAML Global Government Index and 7.53 percent FTSE Russell
World Government Bond Index, which is tracked by $800 billion of
assets. 
    Most major indexes, such as iBoxx and the Bloomberg/Barclays
euro aggregate index, which has a market value of over 10
trillion euros ($11.8 trillion), use the average ratings of
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. 
    So downgrades to junk from two of these agencies would be
enough to take Italy out of these indexes. 
    The ECB, on the other hand, would require all three major
agencies plus DBRS to cut to junk to take Italy out of its
bond-buying programme.
    This issue becomes sharper as the ECB unwinds the programme
this year. When Portugal was merely faced with the threat of
that fourth downgrade from DBRS in August 2016 -- it never
actually came to pass -- its 10-year bond yield spread over
Germany widened 80 basis points in just under two months. 
    Given the complexities and sensitivities, some feel they may
just kick any decision far down the road.
    ""The ratings agencies will give an issuer as influential as
Italy a lot of time,"" said Stealey of JP Morgan AM.

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament on
Tuesday rejected the central bank's deputy governor, Primoz
Dolenc, as the official candidate to take over as bank chief
after most parties gave him the thumbs-down even though he had
the backing of the president.
    With the minority centre-left government unable to agree on
a joint candidate, the outcome suggested it would be some time
before the highly-sensitive top banking job can now be filled.  
    Dolenc, deputy governor since 2016, was nominated for the

Tuesday from only 30 parliamentary members with 39 voting
against him in a secret ballot.
    Slovenia lost its vote on the European Central Bank's

    Allegations of money laundering have plagued Slovenia's

    Pahor's office said after the vote that the president
planned to open a three-week tender for new candidates after 
which he will hold discussions with parliamentary parties and
try to come up with a new name ""as soon as possible"".
    Anyone can propose a candidate for the governor but the

comments)
    By Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries
    DUBLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Ireland's finance minister boosted
the country's budget day spending for the second year in a row
as the government warned of economic ""carnage"" if neighbouring
Britain crashes out of the European Union without a divorce
deal.
    Having already pre-committed 2.6 billion euros on increased
public sector and planned infrastructure spending for next year,
Paschal Donohoe, in Tuesday's annual budget speech, almost
doubled the remaining pot to 1.5 billion euros to dish out on
further tax cuts and spending increases.
    The state's fiscal watchdog warned ahead of the budget that
the booming economy did not need such additional stimulus.
    But with an election potentially looming and the fast
growing economy exacerbating deficits in areas such as housing,
a scrapping of a reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector
primarily funded the extra 700 million euro of spending. 
    That allowed the government to keep giving workers a small
annual tax break it has promised to continue in future budgets,
reverse welfare cuts imposed during a series of savage austerity
budgets a decade ago and boost infrastructure spending.
    ""The shared progress we have made is real. However the risks
and challenges that we now face are equally real,"" Donohoe told
parliament in a speech that went long past the allotted hour as
he reeled off measure after measure but also struck a tone of
caution with 25 different mentions of ""Brexit"".
    Donohoe said the government's ""central case"" was that a
Brexit deal would be reached in the coming weeks between Britain
and the European Union, but that the possibility of a no deal
outcome had influenced the financial decisions made.
    Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later warned of economic
""carnage"" if Britain crashed out of the bloc without a divorce
deal, though he said that would mostly be felt by Britain with
Ireland likely to benefit from ""huge solidarity"" from fellow
member states. [nS8N1TE01H]
    A further round of ""Brexit-proofing"" measures, which have
had mixed results to date, were announced in the budget,
including a 300 million euro loan scheme for small and medium
sized businesses and the agriculture and food sectors to invest
in future growth. [nL8N1WM0OI]
    
    BALANCED BUDGET
    Donohoe said the best preparation for Brexit was responsible
budgeting and he intended to balance the state's books for the
first time in more than a decade next year, an improvement on
the tiny deficit originally planned but still not the surplus
the central bank says should already be running. [nL8N1WL4NS]
    The state's independent fiscal watchdog, set up in response
to the years of reckless spending that left the Irish exchequer
massively exposed when the 2008 financial crisis hit, voiced
concerns ahead of the budget over what its chairman has called
the ""not very good budgetary practice"" of recent years.
    It is particularly worried by successive years of spending
coming in over budget, with this year's 700 million euro or 4.5
percent estimated overrun in the health service equivalent to
almost the entire budget day spending package laid out a year
ago. [nL8N1WO522]
    Hotel and restaurant owners were also unhappy at their
return to the standard 13.5 percent VAT rate from the 9 percent
rate introduced in 2011 to boost the then struggling sector. In
a report in July, Ireland's finance department said the lower
rate had become a ""significant deadweight"". [nL5N1UR5SX]
    ""#Budget19 will be known as an election budget paid for by
the tourism industry,"" Adrian Cummins, head of the Restaurants
Association of Ireland, responded on Twitter.
    Ireland's betting tax was also doubled to 2 percent, hitting
the country's largest operator, Paddy Power Betfair <PPB.I>,
which said it would have cost it 20 million pounds this year.
Its shares closed down 5 percent. [nFWN1WP0J7]
    The budget will be the last before the next parliamentary
election if Donohoe's Fine Gael-led minority government cannot
agree an extension to its ""confidence and supply"" deal with the
largest opposition party, Fianna Fail. 
    Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said that he would seek to
open talks on the expiring deal later on Tuesday and aim to
conclude them by Christmas. [nS8N1VG002]

    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European banking supervisors
have stepped up their monitoring of liquidity levels at Italian
banks after a sharp increase in the country's government bond
yields, although there is no cause for alarm, a senior EU source
said on Tuesday.
    The source told Reuters the monitoring was being carried out
""more intensely than usual"" due to market turmoil in recent
days.
    The checks involve both customer deposits and the interbank
market that banks use to lend to each other without requesting
collateral, the source said, adding that ""no sign of alarm"" had
been detected.
    Both the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank, the
euro zone's single banking supervisor, declined to comment. 
    The ECB, along with national supervisors, regularly monitors
lenders' liquidity conditions and adjusts its monitoring,
including its frequency and depth, during periods of stress or
market volatility, a source at the ECB said. 
    A budget standoff between Rome's anti-establishment
government and European Union authorities on Tuesday pushed
Italy's benchmark 10-year debt costs <IT10YT=RR> to 3.72
percent, the highest level since February 2014. 
    The ruling coalition last month set a deficit target of 2.4
percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous
government's goal for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving
investors and prompting sharp criticism from the European
Commission.
    Italian banks are vulnerable to sovereign debt problems
because they hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds -
or 10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by
hurting the value of those holdings, eats into their capital
levels.
    Shares in the country's lenders have fallen sharply in
recent months and the cost of insuring major banks' debt against
a potential default has increased.
    However, the ample liquidity provided by the ECB during
years of ultra-expansionary monetary policy is shielding the
interbank market from any tensions, Milan traders said.

    ROME, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Italian European Affairs Minister
Paolo Savona said on Tuesday the government could change its
expansionary 2019 budget plan if market pressure on Italy
intensifies too much, Ansa news agency reported.
    ""If the spread (between Italian benchmark bond yields and
their German equivalent) gets out of hand the budget will have
to change,"" Savona was reported as saying in a pre-recorded
television interview.
   ""I am pretty sure that the spread won't reach 400 (basis
points),"" Savona added, according to Ansa, while repeating a
view he has expressed before that if necessary the European
Central Bank should intervene to ensure market stability.
    Italy's 10-year bond yield spread with Germany reached a
5-year peak of around 312 basis points on Tuesday over concerns
about the budget, before narrowing sharply to 293 points.
    The budget plan outlined this month by the right-wing League
and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement aims to raise next
year's fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product,
tripling the target set by the previous centre-left
administration.

a monthly basis since 2015 due to deep discounts for holiday
tours and train tickets, a small respite from inflationary
pressures that continue to keep rate hikes in the cards.
    After the data, central bank Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl -
viewed as the biggest proponent of steady rate hikes but whose
final term on the Czech National Bank's seven-member board ends
soon - said there was little reason to change his view.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European banking supervisors
have stepped up their monitoring of liquidity levels at Italian
banks after a sharp increase in the country's government bond
yields, although there is no cause for alarm, a senior EU source
said on Tuesday.
    The source told Reuters the monitoring was being carried out
""more intensely than usual"" due to market turmoil in recent
days.
    The checks involve both customer deposits and the interbank
market that banks use to lend to each other without requesting
collateral, the source said, adding that ""no sign of alarm"" had
been detected.
    Both the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank, the
euro zone's single banking supervisor, declined to comment. 
    The ECB, along with national supervisors, regularly monitors
lenders' liquidity conditions and adjusts its monitoring,
including its frequency and depth, during periods of stress or
market volatility, a source at the ECB said. 
    A budget standoff between Rome's anti-establishment
government and European Union authorities on Tuesday pushed
Italy's benchmark 10-year debt costs <IT10YT=RR> to 3.72
percent, the highest level since February 2014. 
    The ruling coalition last month set a deficit target of 2.4
percent of economic output for 2019, tripling the previous
government's goal for the heavily indebted nation, unnerving
investors and prompting sharp criticism from the European
Commission.
    Italian banks are vulnerable to sovereign debt problems
because they hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds -
or 10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by
hurting the value of those holdings, eats into their capital
levels.
    Shares in the country's lenders have fallen sharply in
recent months and the cost of insuring major banks' debt against
a potential default has increased.
    However, the ample liquidity provided by the ECB during
years of ultra-expansionary monetary policy is shielding the
interbank market from any tensions, Milan traders said.
    Banks have not suffered any deposit flights either, based on
the latest available data. Italian banks' deposits stood at 2.39
trillion euros in July from 2.41 trillion euros in June, when
the new government was sworn in, and have been broadly stable in
recent months.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - For Italy's sovereign debt the
timing could hardly be worse: A budget standoff with Brussels is
driving the country's bond yields to new peaks, just as two
credit agencies are weighing whether to cut their ratings to
within one notch of 'junk'.
    But as markets move to price in chances of the euro zone's
biggest sovereign bond market losing its investment grade
rating, major bond investors reckon political factors and
significant contagion risk make that almost inconceivable.
    Moody's and S&P Global, both rating Italy two rungs above
'junk', are widely expected to downgrade in late October as the
new government's outsize spending plans put it on a collision
course with EU authorities. 
    One rung lower and Italy would fall below investment grade
for the first time, a move that would potentially cost it
hundreds of billions of euros in lost bond investments.
    The conundrum for financial investors is how to accurately
price the risk of a euro zone sovereign in junk territory -
given that particular sovereign's market footprint, the
complication of still-active European Central Bank bond buying,
eligibility rules for that ECB support and an outside risk to
Italy's euro membership.    
    
    HOW WIDE IS TOO WIDE?
    Some think current Italian government benchmark bond spreads
- which hit a five-year high of 312 basis points over German
Bunds on Tuesday - and credit default swaps pricing already show
the country trading as a junk-rated borrower. 
    Kaspar Hense, portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management,
said an Italy/Germany 10-year spread of 300 basis points was
more compatible with a junk-rated issuer, based on a model
comparing Italy with other developed and emerging market
sovereigns. 
    The main credit agencies say their rating decisions are
guided solely by credit analysis and not any wider political
backdrop.
    But investors are wary that current debt pricing comparisons
may be misleading as they don't account for political
sensitivities, given the sheer scale of Italy's bond market and
its systemic importance to the euro zone project.
    ""A downgrade to junk could trigger a full-blown (euro zone)
crisis,"" said Nicola Mai, a portfolio manager at PIMCO, the
world's largest bond investor. ""...Which is why I don't the
agencies will do it, I don't think they will want to be the ones
causing a crisis in Europe.""
    Iain Stealey, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan
Asset Management - another bulge bracket bond investor - also
said a junk-rated Italy was highly unlikely. 
    ""It would be a very, very big decision, just given the size
of the Italian bond market, it makes up something like a fifth
of government bonds in the euro zone,"" he said. 
    
    That backdrop suggests the bar is higher for Rome than other
borrowers, and the possibility of a junk rating is therefore
only partially factored in.
    Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said last
month in separate notes they reckoned full pricing in would
equate to an Italy/Germany yield spread of 400 bps.
    At the height of the euro zone debt crisis the spread went
even higher, to over 550 basis points, and the country still
kept its investment grade ratings - though that was without the
effect of the ECB's bond-buying scheme.
    However the numbers are parsed, anxiety over the ratings
risk is likely to persist.
    ""The threat of a junk rating won't go away while the current
coalition is in partnership,"" said John Taylor, fixed income
portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, a fund with $546 billion
of assets under management.             
        
    WHAT'S AT STAKE
    Italy comprises about 22 percent of the 1.346 trillion euro
iBoxx EUR Eurozone index, 5.7 percent of $1.35 trillion ICE
BofAML Global Government Index and 7.53 percent FTSE Russell
World Government Bond Index, which is tracked by $800 billion of
assets. 
    Most major indexes, such as iBoxx and the Bloomberg/Barclays
euro aggregate index, which has a market value of over 10
trillion euros ($11.8 trillion), use the average ratings of
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. 
    So downgrades to junk from two of these agencies would be
enough to take Italy out of these indexes. 
    The ECB, on the other hand, would require all three major
agencies plus DBRS to cut to junk to take Italy out of its
bond-buying programme.
    This issue becomes sharper as the ECB unwinds the programme
this year. When Portugal was merely faced with the threat of
that fourth downgrade from DBRS in August 2016 -- it never
actually came to pass -- its 10-year bond yield spread over
Germany widened 80 basis points in just under two months. 
    Given the complexities and sensitivities, some feel they may
just kick any decision far down the road.
    ""The ratings agencies will give an issuer as influential as
Italy a lot of time,"" said Stealey of JP Morgan AM.

ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected in August, rebounding by 1.7 percent from the month before, following a 1.6 percent drop in July, data showed on Wednesday.
    The August increase was the steepest monthly rise since December last year the third increase in the last four reporting months, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
    A Reuters survey of 22 analysts had pointed to an August rise of 0.8 percent.
    However, in the three months to August, output in the euro zone's third largest economy was still down a marginal 0.2 percent compared with the March-to-May period, ISTAT said.
    Output can be volatile in Italy in July and August because many factories are closed for summer, making accurate seasonal adjustments to the data more difficult.
    Industrial production was strong across the board in August, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all rising from the month before.
    On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, output in August was down 0.8 percent, following an unrevised 1.3 percent decline in July.
    Recent data has mainly pointed to a slowing Italian economy, posing a tough challenge for the new anti-establishment government which took office in June.
   The government this month lowered its forecast for this year's GDP growth to 1.2 percent from a 1.5 percent projection made in April. 
    Italian industrial output fell by around a quarter during a steep double dip recession between 2008 and 2014, and has recovered only a small part of that during the last three years.
   
     ISTAT gave the following details.

    ROME, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A downgrade of the Italian debt by
credit rating agencies is possible, a prominent lawmaker of the
ruling League party said on Wednesday, as market concern over
the financial sustainability of the government budget targets
mounted.
    The populist coalition, made up of the right-wing League
party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has set next
year's deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic output, three
times the forecast of the previous centre-left administration.
    The plan has drawn criticism from the European Commission
and has triggered a sharp rise in yields on Italian government
bonds. [nL8N1WP2A1]
    ""A downgrade is possible given the climate that has been
created,"" Alberto Bagnai, chairman of the Senate's finance
committee, said in an interview with Radio Capital.
    Standard & Poor's, which rates Italy's debt ""BBB"" with a

    Moody's, which has a negative outlook on Italy's Baa2
rating, has said it would pass judgment by the end of October.
    Italy's budget plan is a ""mistake"", and the projected rise
in deficit and debt is on the radar screen of all the ratings
agencies, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told
La Stampa newspaper in an interview.[nL8N1WQ0PY]
    ""Certainly what we hear is not a plus for Italy's fiscal
outlook,"" Zandi said. In the same interview, Zandi said he was
not personally involved in deciding Italy's credit rating.

average 1.55 percent on loans to non-financial companies in
August, up from 1.48 percent in July. The average rate on house
mortgages edged up to 2.21 percent from 2.15 percent.
    Loan volumes remained broadly stable from the previous

    Italian banks have been hit by a sell-off of Italian assets

inflation rate accelerated slightly in September, statistics
service ELSTAT data showed on Wednesday.
    The reading was 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in August. The
data showed the headline consumer price index rose to 1.1
percent year-on-year, also picking up from 1.0 percent in the
previous month.
    Greece had been in a protracted deflation mode since March
2013 based on its headline index, as wage and pension cuts and a
multi-year recession took a heavy toll on Greek household
incomes.
    Deflation in the country hit its highest level in Nov. 2013
when consumer prices registered a 2.9 percent year-on-year
decline. The economy emerged from deflation in June 2016.

    By Gernot Heller and Rene Wagner
    BERLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The German government has cut its
forecasts for growth this year and next in Europe's largest
economy and sees an escalation in the global trade dispute as
the main risk for the future, a document seen by Reuters on
Wednesday showed.
    The government - due to present its updated forecasts on
Thursday - slashed its 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts to 1.8
percent, compared with its previous predictions of 2.3 percent
and 2.1 percent respectively, the document showed.
    It blamed weak global trade, reduced state consumption,
revisions to previously reported data and slower production in
the auto sector due to difficulties adjusting to a new pollution
standard.
    Risks for the German economy include Britain's looming
departure from the European Union and threat of economic crises
in Turkey and Argentina spreading to other emerging economies,
the document showed.
    The German government expects the economy to expand by 1.8
percent in 2020, the document showed.
    It said domestic demand remained strong but that the global
economic environment was increasingly difficult.
    Traditionally driven by exports, the German economy - now in
its ninth year of expansion - relies heavily on household
spending to grow as consumers enjoy record-high employment,
rising real wages, strong job security and low borrowing costs.
    Due to an increasingly tight labour market, characterized by
low unemployment and more than a million job vacancies, the
government expects nominal wages to rise by 3.0 percent this
year and by 3.1 percent in both 2019 and 2020.
    With inflation, predicted to rise to 1.9 percent this year
and 2.0 percent in 2019, the wage hikes mean that German
consumers will have more money to spend also in real terms.
    ""In view of the strong expansion of disposable income and
moderate inflation, private consumption is likely to pick up
noticeably,"" the document said.
    Household spending is projected to grow by 1.6 percent in
2018 and by 2.0 percent in 2019.
    Provisional budgeting in the first half of this year caused
by an unusually long coalition building period means that state
spending will be postponed into next year, it said.
    State consumption is projected to rise by 1.4 percent this
year and by 2.5 percent next while state investments are seen
jumping by 5.9 percent in 2018 and by 5.2 percent in 2019.

    BERLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
endorsed a hard-fought EU compromise deal for a 35 percent cut
in car emissions by 2030, despite protests from her country's
own carmakers, who said the target was unrealistic and that
pursuing it would cost jobs.
    Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry
competitiveness, EU environment ministers in Luxembourg talked
for more than 13 hours on Tuesday to reach a compromise over
what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to impose on Europe's powerful
carmakers. [L8N1WP1DN]
    Asked on Wednesday at a Berlin news conference for her view
on the deal, Merkel described the cuts pledges - softer than
those demanded by some EU countries - as ""defensible"", partly
because of the scope for later revising them.
    ""(There is) a revisions clause for 2021, since the question
of how fast we can cut carbon dioxide emissions depends on the
extent of market penetration by electric cars or other cars with
alternative propulsion systems,"" she said. ""Under these
circumstances I think the agreement is wholly defensible.""
    The EU talks were lent added urgency by the publication of a
U.N. report this week warning that time was running short for
taking the rapid and unprecedented global action was needed to
contain global warming.
    The targets were harsher than the 30 percent cut wanted by
Germany, with its vast auto industry, and the EU's executive,
but far short of the 40 percent cuts some other member states
were seeking.
    While Merkel said the agreement at least provided certainty
to European carmakers, the industry's umbrella group protested
at the pace of the cuts envisaged and called for more public
support for the transition to electric vehicles.
    ""It's very regrettable that a majority of EU member states
didn't find it in themselves to strike a balance between climate
protection and preserving jobs,"" said Bernhard Mattes, head of
the VDA auto industry umbrella group. [nL8N1WQ3YD]
    Member state governments needed to take on more of the
financial burden of building out networks of charging stations
if they wanted swifter adoption of low-pollution electric cars,
he added.
    But, in an indication of the depths of divisions in
environmentally-minded Germany over the role of its most
important export industry, the toughened targets brought home
from Luxembourg failed to win over the opposition.
    ""A 35 percent cut is nothing like enough for the challenges
of tomorrow,"" said Greens leader Anton Hofreiter. ""The
government must take its foot off the brake in climate matters.""

    * Romania has 5.2 million pensioners
    * Bucharest seen overshooting EU's budget gap threshold

    By Radu-Sorin Marinas
    BUCHAREST, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Romania's government has
approved a plan to more than double state pensions over the next
four years for the country's 5.2 million retirees, a move that
critics say will put heavy strain on public finances in the long
run.
    Under the plan, pension-related spending in the social
security budget would rise steeply to 142 billion lei ($35.12
billion) by 2022, from about 62 billion set aside for this year.
    ""We won't enforce any cuts in exchange, nor introduce new
taxes to support this plan, GDP will expand every year over the
next four years,"" Labour Minister Olguta Vasilescu told
reporters on  Wednesday. The budgetary impact will be 8.4
billion lei in 2019.
    The aim of the overhaul is to iron out discrepancies that
have built up over the years between various beneficiaries of
the state pension system, regardless of the year of retirement
or previous employment.
    The ministry said previously that the cash required to meet
the plan would be partly covered by a 70 percent increase in
revenues from mandatory social contributions.
    The government, which has a comfortable majority in
parliament, will now submit the plan to legislators for debate
and approval.
    Vasilescu said that after 2022 all state pensions would be
adjusted in line with consumer price inflation plus 50 percent
of the real growth of the average wage in the economy.
    Official statistics put the current monthly average state
pension in Romania at about 1,100 lei.    
    The Social Democrat government is targeting a consolidated
budget deficit of just under 3 percent of GDP - the European
Union's ceiling - this year. Economists polled by Reuters expect
an overshoot to 3.1 percent of GDP.

    By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - European shares had their worst
day on Wednesday since June as concerns around rising debt
yields gripped equity markets worldwide, while tech stocks sank
on signs of slowing demand in the semiconductor industry. 
    The pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> tumbled 1.6
percent to its lowest since April 4 while Germany's DAX <.GDAXI>
dropped 2.2 percent. It was the biggest fall for the STOXX since
June 25. 
    U.S. stocks have also fallen sharply as U.S. Treasury yields
climbed to a near seven-year high.
    ""The rise in yields has been especially swift ... Such a
sharp move has always been tricky for equities to digest,"" said
Goldman Sachs strategists. 
    The tech sector <.SX8P> sank 4.3 percent, its worst day
since the Brexit referendum selloff, as investors dumped the
highly-valued sector on signs of weakening demand for chips.
    Austrian chipmaker AMS <AMS.S> fell 5.9 percent and peer
STMicroelectronics <STM.PA> lost 5.8 percent after VAT Group
said it was cutting working hours at one of its factories due to
a fall in demand from the chip equipment makers it supplies.
[nL8N1WQ2C4]
    Shares in VAT Group <VACN.S> sank 10.3 percent.
    ""On the one hand, the short time working reflects the
well-known softening of the investment cycle in the
semiconductor industry since Q2 2018 ... and on the other hand
it also reflects the fact the industry weakness looks to be
extending into Q1 2019,"" wrote Baader Helvea analysts. 
    The selloff in tech deepened with the Wall Street open, as
the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 2.3 percent.
    Fears of a Chinese slowdown drove luxury stocks down too,
also weighed by a Morgan Stanley downgrade of the sector to
""underweight"".
    France's LVMH <LVMH.PA> fell 7.1 percent even though results
after Tuesday's close showed its fashion and leather goods unit
did better than expected in the third quarter [nP6N1W700F]. 
    Morgan Stanley analysts said luxury stocks were likely to
fall further due to slowing Chinese consumption, weakening
earnings and sales momentum, and the sector's vulnerability to
general underperformance of growth versus value stocks. 
    Moncler <MONC.MI> fell 10.9 percent, Kering fell 9.6 percent
and Hermes lost 5.1 percent. 
    In Britain, signs of progress in Brexit negotiations
[nL8N1WQ1LL] helped to push sterling up, weighing on the FTSE
100 <.FTSE> which dropped 1.3 percent. Luxury group Burberry
<BRBY.L> fell 9 percent.  
    Italian banks <.FTIT8300> were a notable exception to the
general selloff, holding flat as yields on the country's
sovereign debt fell after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
confirmed budget forecasts and said he expected a collaboration
with the European Union over the budget. [nL8N1WQ22W]
    The biggest European faller was Wirecard <WDIG.DE> which
sank 14.2 percent, the day after the German payments firm got a
big boost when it unveiled new targets, saying it would deliver
six times current EBITDA by 2025. 
    The stock has moved 9 percent or more every day this week,
and fell on Wednesday despite many positive notes from brokers
including an upgrade to ""outperform"" from Credit Suisse. 
    ""The 'conservative' targets appear aggressive to us and
require an enormous leap of faith in technology, footprint,
execution and macro conditions,"" wrote Neil Campling, co-head of
the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.

    BERLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel

environmental regulations could have dire consequences. 
    ""An industry can collapse faster than many believe,"" Diess
told the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Wednesday.
    A 40 percent cut in car emissions by 2030 would result in
the loss of about a quarter of VW's factory jobs, or 100,000
positions, he said. The 35 percent reduction ""doesn't look much
better"", he added.
    In an indication of the depths of divisions in
environmentally-minded Germany over the role of its most

    MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Fitch said on Wednesday it had
downgraded the rating of Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> to
reflect its view that there was a real possibility the bank
could fail, although the bank dismissed such a prospect and
questioned the agency's assessment.
    The rating agency said it believed it would be challenging
for the bank to strengthen its capital and said that could
ultimately lead to regulatory intervention. 
    ""Our assessment of Carige's funding continues to reflect a
franchise that remains vulnerable to creditor sentiment, which
could lead to deposit outflows, but also significant refinancing
risk,"" it said. 
    Carige said in a statement on Wednesday that regulators had
not raised the possibility of failure in talks with the bank. It
said its capital requirements, or the CET 1 ratio, was ""in line
with the requirements of the regulator.""
    The Genoa-based lender said Fitch had not taken into account
progress made at the recent shareholder meeting in terms of
governance and financial support from shareholders, adding it
reserved the right to ""evaluate Fitch's way of doing things"".
    Boardroom conflicts have thrust Italy’s last remaining large
problem bank into the spotlight, putting a question mark over a
turnaround which was starting to bear fruit.
    The European Central Bank (ECB) has given Carige until the
end of the year to close a capital shortfall, or start seeking a
merger with a stronger peer.
    Carige said in its statement that it had held a constructive
meeting with the ECB on Wednesday that had looked at future
prospects, including possible alliances.
    Fitch cut Carige ratings to 'CCC+' from 'B-'. [nFit77wQ8t]

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - There is no
immediate danger of Italy losing market access or being
downgraded below investment grade because the Italian economy
has underlying strengths, the head of the euro zone bailout fund
ESM Klaus Regling said on Thursday.
    In a panel discussion at an event at the International
Monetary Fund meetings in Bali, Indonesia, Regling was
responding to a question on what would happen if Italy lost
market access like Greece did in 2010, triggering the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe.
    ""There is no immediate danger for Italy to lose access to
the markets, there is no immediate danger of it being downgraded
below investment grade, they are still two notches above,""
Regling said.
    Regling noted that during the Greek debt crisis, Italy never
lost market access because of the underlying strengths of its
economy.
    ""Despite the high debt levels, the fiscal deficit was never
excessively high, the primary surplus was quite sizeable, Italy
has a current account surplus and Italian private domestic
savings are very strong, and a large share of Italian government
bonds are in the hands of residents,"" Regling said.
    Italy's populist government raised market concern when it
announced two weeks ago a plan to raise its headline budget gap
to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 and keep it
there in 2020 and 2021. 
    This would mean also a higher structural deficit - the
balance which excludes one offs and business cycle effects - and
higher debt in a country which already has a debt to GDP ratio
of 133 percent, the second highest in Europe.
    ""I don't like the announcements on fiscal targets for the
next three years because they are not in line with the European
fiscal framework which was adopted by all governments including
the Italian government at the time,"" Regling said.
    Pressure from investors selling Italian debt and from euro
zone peers made Rome lower the deficit targets for 2020 to 2.1
percent and to 1.8 percent in 2021, but euro zone officials said
it was not nearly enough, as Italian debt would still rise.
    ""We already saw that the Italian government made some
adjustments during the last few weeks, so I hope this is not the
end of the story,"" Regling said.
    ""But at the same time, let's not forget that there are some
underlying strengths so there is no reason to immediately expect
now the worst,"" Regling said.
    Italian benchmark 10-year bonds <IT10YT=TWEB> still held at
4.5 year highs of 3.543 percent on Thursday, though slightly off
the peak of 3.697 percent on Tuesday.

    By Michael Nienaber
    BERLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Ministers from Chancellor Angela
Merkel's conservatives attacked on Thursday a proposal by the
Social Democrats to fine carmakers who fail to offer diesel
hardware retrofits, opening a new battle front in their fragile
coalition government.
    The government outlined plans earlier this month to cut
pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer
owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes in an attempt to
avert driving bans in major cities such as Berlin and Hamburg.
    But the co-governing centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) want
to go a step further and fine carmakers that fail to fix
polluting diesel-engined vehicles.
    Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a member of Merkel's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Transport Minister Andreas
Scheuer, a member of her Bavarian CSU allies, both rejected the
idea, saying it was probably illegal.
    ""Fines are justified under German law when someone has
breached his legal obligations. But I have doubts whether this
path is even feasible under constitutional law,"" Altmaier told
Deutschlandfunk radio.
    Scheuer, in an interview with daily newspaper Bild, rejected
accusations that the conservatives were too cosy with Germany's
auto sector, which employs over a million people and whose
exports generate a large chunk of the country's output.
    ""I'm not the spokesman of the car industry,"" Scheuer said,
calling on the companies to rebuild lost trust.
    ""I cannot pass a law that forces old diesel cars off the
streets because they are on the road totally legally,"" Scheuer
added.
    Pollution from diesel cars has come under intense scrutiny
after Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> in 2015 admitted to using illegal
software to cheat emissions tests, sparking a scandal that has
cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.
    Carsten Schneider, a senior figure in the centre-left SPD's
parliamentary group, said on Wednesday that carmakers could be
fined up to 5,000 euros ($5,7600) per vehicle if they did not
carry out remedial work on older diesel cars. [nL8N1WQ41G]
    He had said he had doubts whether Scheuer was treating the
issue with the necessary urgency and said he should ""not behave
as though he was the country's chief car salesman but rather
like someone who represents the interests of those who have
bought diesel cars.""
    The row comes after the coalition nearly fell apart twice in
the past months due to disputes about immigration and the far
right.

lowest level in more than 20 months on Thursday following a rout
on Wall Street as jitters over rising U.S. Treasury yields
sparked a broad selloff of risky assets.
    All sectors in Europe were trading in the red, with tech
stocks bearing the brunt of the selling pressure after the big
U.S. technology stocks that have been the driving force behing a
multi-year bull market posted heavy losses overnight.
    Europe's tech index <.SX8P> fell 2.4 percent, even though
Ingenico <INGC.PA> rallied 8.5 percent after Natixis <CNAT.PA>
said it was examining a merger of its payments activities with
the financial and payments firm. [nL8N1WR185]
    By 0712 GMT, the broader pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX>
index fell 1.4 percent to its lowest level since end January
2017. All big country benchmarks across Europe were down more
than 1 percent. Defensive sectors such as healthcare were also
lower, but outperformed the broader market.    
    Bayer <BAYGn.DE> rose 5.6 percent after its Monstanto unit
received a tentative ruling for a new trial on the $250 million
in punitive damages in U.S. weed-killer case. [nL2N1WQ228]
    Top faller on the STOXX was UK recruiter Hays <HAYS.L>. Its
shares fell 9 percent after the company reported a slower
quarterly fee growth rate, hurt by a relatively stronger pound
against other foreign currencies. [nL4N1WR2RH]

    ROME, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Italian government's plans to
lower the retirement age will cost future generations around 100
billion euros ($115.4 billion), the chief of Italy's state
pension agency, INPS, said on Thursday.
    The reform ""will increase pension debt for young people by
about 100 billion euros,"" Tito Boeri told a parliamentary
hearing. ""We have no choice but to sound an alarm.""
    Italy's populist coalition government, made up of the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League party,
has promised to roll back a 2011 reform that raised the
retirement age when Italy was at the centre of the eurozone debt
crisis.
    The government has earmarked 7 billion euros in the 2019
budget to allow people to retire at 62 if they have paid pension
contributions for at least 38 years. Workers now need at least
42 years of contributions before retiring.
    Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said
watering down the so-called Fornero pension reform will allow
400,000 people to retire earlier than expected, opening a
similar number of jobs for young people.
    In a statement released after Boeri's presentation, Salvini
called on the head of INPS to stand down.
    ""As an Italian, I invite Dr. Boeri, who once more today is
defending his beloved Fornero law, to resign from INPS and to
stand at the next election with a campaign pledge to make people
retire at 80,"" Salvini said.
    Boeri's mandate at INPS expires in February and he looks
highly unlikely to remain in his post following a number of
clashes with the ruling parties [nL8N1UF6WG].
    Salvini said on Wednesday, after meeting a dozen of
industry's top managers, that state-controlled companies were
ready to hire tens of thousands of people if the retirement age
was lowered [nL8N1WQ5TE].
    The Bank of Italy said on Tuesday that cutting the
retirement age may put threaten the sustainability of the
pension system. According to studies conducted by the central
bank, there was no evidence that hiking pension age reduces
youth employment, it added.
    Boeri told lawmakers the new measures would increase pension
spending by 1 percentage point of gross domestic product in
2021.

    MILAN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Italy paid its highest borrowing
rate in five years in a bond auction on Thursday after its new
populist government alarmed investors by tripling the budget
deficit target for next year.
    Some investors fear Rome is sowing the seeds of a future
debt crisis by pushing ahead with costly electoral promises such
as a lower retirement age and a basic income for the poor. Italy
holds the world's third-largest public debt burden.
    In Thursday's auction the Treasury sold a new three-year
bond at a yield of 2.51 percent, the highest since September
2013, though demand for this and other issues was strong.
    Public debt runs at 1.3 times economic output in Italy, a
country that suffers from chronically low growth. The ruling
coalition came to power in June, promising to kickstart economic
growth and tackle rising poverty with higher public spending.
    Despite the jump in borrowing costs, continued strong demand
for Italian paper calmed fears in the market, with yields on
existing bonds dipping on the auction results.
    ""Demand at the auction was good, though you have to remember
that the size of the issue was contained and this really
helped,"" said Luca Cazzulani, deputy head of fixed-income
strategy at UniCredit.
    The treasury raised 6.5 billion euros ($7.5 billion), the
maximum it had set itself ahead of the auction, by issuing bonds
maturing over three, seven, 15 and 30 years. [nZYN22EX02]
    The yield on the seven-year bond at auction was a record
since Italy began issuing this maturity in January 2014.
    The 2019 budget plan has ignited concerns at the European
Commission, and among Italy's euro zone partners, that Rome's
spending could undermine the single currency.
    Some independent Italian state bodies have also raised
alarms. Italy's INPS says that planned pension changes would
raise pension debt by about 100 billion euros while parliament's
budget oversight agency says the government's economic growth
forecast is overly optimistic. [nR1N1VZ01X]
    The government targets a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of
domestic output next year, three times the level set by the
previous centre-left executive.
    Investors are now nervously awaiting updates on Italy's
creditworthiness from rating agencies, with Standard & Poor's
due to review its ""BBB"" rating on Oct. 26. [nL8N1WK2VZ]
    Moody's will decide by the end of October whether to
downgrade Italy after placing its rating on review for a
possible cut after the new coalition's spending plans first
surfaced.

 (Recasts, adds quotes)
    By Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew MacAskill
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Former British leader Tony Blair
said there was a 50-50 chance of another Brexit referendum as
Prime Minister Theresa May will be unlikely to secure a
parliamentary majority for any divorce deal.
    Less than six months before Britain leaves the European
Union, there is little clarity about how post-Brexit trade
between the EU and the world's fifth largest economy will
function.
    If May can strike a deal with the EU, her minority
government then has to get it approved by a deeply-divided
parliament. 
    ""Whatever Brexit is on offer today is going to result in
significant economic harm,"" Blair, former head of the opposition
Labour Party and prime minister from 1997 to 2007, told Reuters.
""I think the odds are now 50 percent that you will get another
(referendum) vote.""
    ""I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped,"" he
said. ""There is no majority in parliament for any proposition
that the prime minister brings back."" 
    Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the
divorce is Britain’s most significant political and economic
move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different
futures for the $2.9 trillion UK economy and the world’s biggest
trading bloc.
    Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: Less than
two decades ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing
about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the
reserve of fringe politicians.
    But the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration
and miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron
prompted Britons to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June
2016 referendum.
    A new vote, Blair said, could ask whether voters wanted to
exit without a deal or stay in a reformed EU and offer new
membership terms. He said EU leaders would be willing to reform
the bloc.
    
    BREXIT REVERSE GEAR?
    Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing
other critics, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who
have suggested Britain could still change its mind.
    Recent opinion polls indicate a slight move towards support
for staying in the EU.
    But May has repeatedly said there will be no new referendum.
    Blair said that if Brexit did happen, economic dislocation
would force Britain to deregulate further to attract foreign
investors.
    Brexiteers anticipate some short-term economic pain but say
Britain will then thrive if cut loose from what they see as a
doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive
debt-funded welfare spending.
    Blair said that if the UK exited the EU and then socialist
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn won power, the country would
face a ""truly damaging and challenging situation"".
    ""This is the problem with the policies of both major
parties: they seem to think you can do Brexit and then engage in
a whole lot of social legislation to make capitalism fairer and
more equal and so on,"" Blair said.
    ""They have got to wake up to the fact that if you do Brexit
your number-one priority is going to be keeping this place as an
attractive place for investors to come.""
    He said European regulators would not want the centre of
European finance - currently London - to be outside their orbit.
    ""Why give ourselves this problem in a field of the global
economy where we are globally preeminent?"" Blair said, adding
that the government had cast aside the interests of the service
sector.

    By Elizabeth Piper and Alistair Smout
    LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will
meet some of her ministers on Thursday to discuss Brexit, hours
after her parliamentary partner threatened to withdraw its
support if she accepts what it calls a ""draconian solution"" from
the European Union.
    Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU, the
two sides differ on their view of the talks - the bloc says a
withdrawal deal is within reach, while British officials say
""big issues"" still lie in the way of any agreement.
    They do agree on one thing - that time is running out to
seal a deal to pave the way for Britain's divorce, the biggest
change in trade and foreign policy for more than 40 years. As
that departure date creeps closer, those wanting to influence
May's approach to Brexit are intensifying their efforts.
    One of the biggest hurdles is an agreement on the so-called
Irish backstop to prevent the return of a hard border between
the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member state
Ireland if there is no immediate trade deal. 
    A seamless border is part of the 1998 settlement which
largely ended decades of sectarian violence in the province. May
is also committed to preserving ""frictionless"" trade with the EU
after Britain leaves.
    Neither side has indicated there has been a deal on the
Irish backstop. But after meetings in Brussels, Northern
Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up the minority
Conservative government in parliament, has issued a series of
terse warnings to May.
    DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson condemned what he said was
the EU's offer for a backstop that would keep Britain in the EU
customs union for an unspecified, time-limited period, would
exclude Northern Ireland from new British trade deals and see
checks on goods moving from mainland Britain to the province.
    May's acceptance of such a proposal ""would have implications
not just for Brexit legislation – 50 per cent of which would not
have passed without DUP support – but also for the budget,
welfare reform and other domestic legislation"", Wilson said.
    ""She will not have DUP support regardless of whether the
government tries to bribe, bully or browbeat us into accepting
it,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
    By withdrawing its support, the DUP could make it difficult
for May to pass legislation through parliament, including the
budget which will be voted on later this month.
    
    MEETING
    May's spokesman said the prime minister would gather several
of her ministers later on Thursday as part of routine meetings
to keep her cabinet team updated on progress in Brexit talks,
which he said still had to tackle ""big issues"". [nS8N1UL035]
    The meeting takes place against growing criticism over her
approach to exiting the EU, with some Conservative eurosceptic
lawmakers saying they will vote against any deal based on her
""Chequers"" proposal - named after her country residence - as it
will not bring a complete break from the EU in their view.
    Former prime minister John Major, whose career as leader was
crushed partly by eurosceptics, said the behaviour of some of
those Conservatives was ""an intolerable way to treat a prime
minister who's in the middle of negotiations"". 
    But the parliamentary arithmetic is difficult for May. With
the support of the DUP, she commands a majority of only 13
lawmakers and needs to keep either her own party onside or
attract votes from the main opposition Labour Party.
    Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the party will vote
against any deal that does not meet its tests, which include
retaining ""the exact same"" benefits Britain now has within the
EU's customs union and single market - something the Chequers
plan does not fulfil.
    And former Labour leader Tony Blair added his voice to calls
for the party to vote down May's Brexit divorce deal, saying
there was a 50-50 chance of holding another referendum.
[nL8N1WR2RA] The 2016 referendum resulted in a 52-48 percent
victory for the Leave campaign.
    ""I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped,""
Blair told Reuters. ""I think there is no majority in parliament
for any proposition that the prime minister brings back.""

    * Vote risks widening divisions in shaky federal government

    By Paul Carrel and Jörn Poltz
    BERLIN/MUNICH, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Bavarian allies are heading for their worst showing in a state
election in over 60 years, a setback that risks widening
divisions within Germany's crisis-prone national government.
    Polls show the Christian Social Union (CSU) will win at most
35 percent on Sunday, losing the absolute majority with which it
has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of the
post-war period.
    That stable power base has also allowed the CSU, sister
party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to punch
above its weight in Berlin.
    Since Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to
more than 1 million migrants, CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been
a thorn in her side, gradually shifting his party to the right
to counter the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for
Germany (AfD) party. 
    ""I would expect Seehofer to lash out against her again,""
said Carsten Nickel at consultancy Teneo Intelligence. ""The CSU
is in decline, and that process ...is not going to play out
without significant noise.""
    Divisions between the conservative allies have widened
further since March, when an inconclusive national election
forced them into a coalition with the left-leaning Social
Democrats (SPD).
    Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already
come close to collapsing twice, in arguments over immigration
and a scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster, while a
simmering row over phasing out polluting diesel cars now
threatens to boil over. [nL8N1WN0YX]
    On Thursday SPD leader Andrea Nahles, citing divisions
between the CDU and CSU, again questioned her party's future in
the government. [nL8N1WQ4A1]
    
    NO MERKEL IN MUNICH
    On Saturday, Merkel urged the conservative parties to end
their infighting before the Bavaria vote, but after her rows
with Seehofer - who serves as interior minister in Berlin - she
will not join the CSU's final rally in Munich on Friday.
[nL8N1WM0ER]
    Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, an immigration
hardliner, will attend instead.
    The CSU was forced into a coalition from 2008 to 2013 after
losing its absolute majority, but had previously ruled Bavaria
alone since 1966. Since 1954, its share of the vote has not
fallen below 43 percent.
    A weak showing on Sunday - from which the AfD and the
ecologist Greens look best placed to benefit - is also likely to
escalate infighting among CSU leaders desperate to revive the
idea that the party represents the essence of Bavaria's economic
and cultural success story.
    Sunday's vote, likely to force the CSU into a coalition
potentially as messy as the one in Berlin, is followed by three
more events this year that pose a more direct risk to Merkel.
    Her CDU is expected to suffer setbacks in another regional
state vote in Hesse in late October, and the party then holds a
conclave and its annual congress.
    If Merkel does not emerge well, her opponents would likely
""feel encouraged to come out in the open and intensify their
criticism,"" Matthias Dilling at Oxford University said. 
    The parliamentary party ousted her ally, Volker Kauder, as
leader last month, but senior conservatives on Sunday backed her
bid for re-election as CDU chairwoman at the congress.
        
    ""HATRED AND SMEARS""
    In Bavaria, support for the AfD - with whom the CSU has
ruled out an alliance - stands at 10-14 percent, surveys show. 
    The Greens, polling around 18 percent, are emboldened by
successes in neighbouring Baden-Wuerttemberg, traditionally a
conservative state, where they now lead a coalition government.
    After the Freie Waehler (FW), a locally focused conservative
party polling around 11 percent, the Greens could be next in
line as a potential partner for Seehofer - though that seems far
from a natural fit.
    ""People in Bavaria have had enough hatred and smears ...
they want politics that show courage,"" Greens' Bavaria leader
Katharina Schulze said this week in a swipe at the CSU.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - European Commission Vice
President Jyrki Katainen urged Italy on Thursday to submit a
draft budget in line with commitments and warned of risks for
Italy and other euro zone states.
    Italy's eurosceptic government raised market concern when it
announced two weeks ago a plan to raise its headline budget gap
to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 and flout
fiscal targets agreed with euro zone peers.
    ""The situation is very fragile,"" Katainen told reporters
when asked about Italy's budgetary plans and initially negative
market reaction. He said no one wanted financial instability
that could hit Italy and other euro zone countries ""that may
suffer from contagion risks"".
    On Wednesday, the governor of the Bank of Greece said a drop
in Greek bank shares was caused by external factors, as analysts
blamed Italy's row with the EU over its budget as the main cause
of market pressure on Greek lenders [nL8N1WQ1NS].
    Katainen, who is responsible for jobs and growth, said the
Commission was trying to convince Italy to change its budget
plans, which are likely to flout EU fiscal rules.
    ""Everybody has seen the situation in the markets, which is
not positive,"" he said, referring to reaction to the Italian
plans. ""Our interest is to get a result which is credible and
try to convince the Italian government to take responsibility.""
    All euro zone states have to submit their draft budgets for
next year to Brussels by Oct. 15. The Commission could reject
Italy's plan if it is found in breach of fiscal rules.
    ""We do hope we can get good cooperation with the Italian
government,"" Katainen said.
    He added: ""It is not too late to maintain stability. It is
not too late to make sure that growth can continue in Italy. It
is not too late to show that public financing in Italy is on a
credible path.""
    Last week, the Commission sent a letter to the Italian
government warning its budget plans were a reason for ""serious
concern"" as they appeared to deviate significantly from agreed
fiscal targets. [nL8N1WM0IR]

target of 0.7 percent of GDP appears to be within reach, the
Bank of Portugal said on Thursday, also confirming its previous
economic growth estimate of 2.3 percent, which is in line with
the government's forecast.
    ""The target, of 0.7 percent deficit, appears feasible

although it still involves some uncertainty,"" the central bank
said in its autumn economic bulletin. 
    The targeted deficit would be the narrowest in over four
decades of Portugal's democratic history, coming four years
after its exit from an international bailout programme.
    The central bank also revised last year's growth higher to
2.8 percent from 2.7 percent, which was the strongest rate of
expansion since the turn of the century.
    The slowdown this year is mainly due to a weaker exports
growth, which the central projects at 5 percent after last
year's 7.8 percent, and gross fixed capital formation, seen
growing 3.9 percent this year after 9.2 percent in 2017.

proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) after Greece,
which has received three multi-billion-euro bailouts over the
past few years. Italy's debt exceeds 130 percent of GDP.
    Italy's previous centre-left government passed several
measures to help the banking sector recover after a deep
recession, culminating in the state bailout of the country's
third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> in 2017.
    Scholz told German broadcaster ARD that Europe was well
prepared for possible crises.
    ""We have created many oversight bodies to better monitor the
banking system, and we have developed resolution mechanisms and
funds to respond to crises without the need for government
funding,"" he said.
    Every country was responsible for its own economy, he said,
adding: ""If you have a lot of debt, as is the case with Italy,
then of course you have to pay much more attention than other
countries to how financial markets handle future public debt.""
    Italy paid its highest borrowing rate in five years in a
bond auction on Thursday after the government alarmed investors
by tripling the budget deficit target for next year.
[nL8N1WR2S5]
    Last week, the European Commission sent a letter to the
government warning its budget plans were a reason for ""serious
concern"" as they appeared to deviate significantly from agreed
fiscal targets. [nL8N1WM0IR]

Greek banks dropped in September compared to the previous month,
Bank of Greece data showed on Thursday.
    Emergency funding, which is more costly than borrowing from
the European Central Bank, dropped to 3.58 billion euros ($4.14
billion) from 4.49 billion euros at the of August, the data
showed.
    Greek banks have relied on emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) drawn from the central bank since February 2015 after
being cut off from the ECB's funding window due to stalled
bailout talks between the government and its official creditors.
    Their dependence on the ELA emergency lifeline declined
sharply since June 2016 when the European Central Bank
reinstated banks' access to its cheap funding operations.
    But with Athens out of its bailout program since August 21,
the ECB has ended the waiver that made Greek government bonds
eligible collateral for its cheap funding.

Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget could escalate in the coming days if the EU Commission
decided to trigger a procedure to reject the Italian budgetary
plans.
    The unprecedented move would formally begin a long legal
dispute that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy
until it is resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but has so far not been applied to any member
of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the possible
procedure and of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Oct. 15: This is the deadline for euro zone states to submit
to the EU Commission their draft budgets for the following year.
     
    Oct. 22: After the submission of draft plans, the Commission
has one week to identify ""particularly serious non-compliance
with the budgetary policy obligations"" of a state. Assuming
Italy submits its draft budget on Oct. 15, as is common
practice, the Commission will have until Oct. 22 to make its
concerns known to Italy.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to a run a structural surplus of 0.6
percent of its Gross Domestic Product in 2019, but the
government's new plans foresee instead a structural deficit of
0.8 percent of GDP. The structural balance excludes one-off
expenditures, for emergencies or natural catastrophes.  
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of 130 percent of GDP, which should instead fall,
under EU rules.
    
   Oct. 29: If the Commission decided to consider Italy's draft
budget non-compliant with EU rules, it has to reject it within
two weeks of submission. This deadline would expire on Oct. 29
if Italy submits its budget on Oct 15. Brussels would have to
explain in a written opinion its reasons for sending the budget
back to Rome for changes. 
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
regular monthly meeting which would put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 19: In the event its budget were rejected by the
Commission, the Italian government would have three weeks from
the date of the EU opinion to submit a revised budget. This
deadline would expire on Nov. 19 if the Commission's opinion was
adopted on Oct. 29.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 10: The Commission would have three weeks, likely until
Dec. 10, from the submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt
a new opinion in which it would describe Italy's overall
budgetary position and its impact on the whole euro zone.
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission is expected
to publish its economic forecasts up to 2020, which would show
whether EU calculations match Italy's growth, debt and deficit
projections which underpin budget targets. The data could pave
the way to sanction procedures if EU and Italian data differed
widely.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines. 
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just few
weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partner
hit record lows, a survey showed on Thursday, as the German
chancellor struggles to prevent her fractious government from
falling apart.
    Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the SPD each saw
their voter share fall by 3 percentage points, to 26 and 15
percent respectively, the DeutschlandTrend survey for
broadcaster ARD showed.
    They were the monthly survey's weakest ever figures for the
coalition parties, ARD said.
    The poll also relegated the SPD to fourth place, behind the
pro-immigration Greens, up 3 percentage points on 17 percent,
and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party,
unchanged on 16 percent.
    The results chime with expectations that the CSU, the
Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU, is heading for its worst
showing in a state election in over 60 years on Sunday, a
setback that risks widening divisions within the coalition.

out polluting diesel cars.
    Pollster Infratest dimap conducted the survey of 1,508

consequence of trade tensions.
    Turning to Italy, Scholz said he took Italian policymakers'
pledge to respect EU budget rules ""at face value"" but sent a
warning to the euro zone's largest debtor.
    ""If anybody has to give advice to Italy it's to be careful

    The central bank said the harmonised index of consumer
prices (HICP) would increase by 2.2 percent in 2018 and 2019. In
a previous forecast in June it had predicted the same increase
for this year and 2.0 percent next year. [nV9N1JQ02L]

    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Danske Bank
<DANSKE.CO> said on Friday it has begun closing down parts of
its Estonian business, which has been at the centre of an
investigation into alleged money laundering. 
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
transactions processed by Denmark's biggest bank via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank
said last month it thinks are suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    The bank said in April it would scale down its business in
the Baltic countries to focus on the Nordic markets.
    It said it would serve only subsidiaries of its Nordic
customers in the Baltics and global companies with business
interests in the Nordics. [nL8N1S31DG]
    ""We're writing to both private and corporate customers that
we have to close down their products and services,"" a Danske
Bank spokesman said on Friday.
    Estonia's Ministry of Finance will close its accounts at
Danske Bank's Estonian branch as of Nov. 30 following the bank's
announcement from April.
    ""As Danske Bank has declared that in the future they will
concentrate only on servicing non-resident business clients and
their subsidiaries in Estonia, the Ministry does not deem it
necessary to have accounts there any more,"" a spokeswoman said.
    The Danske Bank spokesman would not say how many accounts it
is closing or how many jobs would be affected by the process,
which began in late April and will last for around a year.
    The time taken was due to the dialogue the bank had with
customers and the different notice terms, he added.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italy is resorting
to failed state medicine to heal Alitalia [CAITLA.UL]. The
radical new government in Rome wants the finance ministry and
local railway operator to support a 2 billion euro rescue of the
struggling carrier. Industry Minister Luigi Di Maio, who also
leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, says he welcomes
international investors. But state involvement may scare off
potential partners and make it harder for Alitalia to cut costs.
    Di Maio’s endorsement of a taxpayer bailout is not a
surprise. Italy’s new government wants the state to play a
bigger role in the country’s industrial policy. Since taking
office in June, it has suggested renationalising motorway
concessions and creating a public investment bank. 
    The 5-Star Movement in particular seems to dream of going
back to the days when the Italian state, through its industrial
arm IRI, controlled large chunks of the domestic economy. But
the country’s large public debt will make it difficult to roll
back past privatisations. 
    Alitalia, however, needs urgent attention. Di Maio’s plan,
which has not yet been finalised, would see the state own around
15 percent of a new company, stripped of its debt, joined by
rail operator Ferrovie dello Stato <IPO-FERRO.MI>. State
investor Cassa Depositi e Prestiti [CDP.UL] could play a
supporting role by helping to fund a new fleet of aircraft. 
    It’s far from clear why this bailout would have a better
chance of success. Alitalia’s repeated insolvencies have cost
Italian taxpayers at least 10 billion euros, says transport
expert Andrea Guircin. The previous revamp – which saw Abu
Dhabi-based Etihad Airways take a 49 percent stake – faltered
after just three years due to a mixture of lack of cash and lack
of control. 
    Meanwhile Alitalia keeps losing altitude relative to
European competitors: it flies barely 22 million passengers a
year. Ryanair <RYA.I>, Air France KLM <AIRF.PA> and British
Airways owner IAG <ICAG.L> carry 100 million or more. Lufthansa
<LHAG.DE> and easyJet <EZJ.L> tried to purchase Alitalia last
year, but talks appear to have foundered on the need to cut
jobs. 
    Catching up with rivals in a costly industry could be
impossible if Alitalia keeps flying solo. And if the new plan
fails, taxpayers will once again bear the costs.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - The Italian government is working on a plan to rescue
Alitalia that will see it own around 15 percent of the
loss-making airline, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said in
an interview with Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore published on Oct.
12.
    - The plan envisages injecting between 1.5 billion and 2
billion euros of capital into a new company, stripped of bad
assets, in partnership with state-controlled railway operator
Ferrovie dello Stato. Di Maio added that one or more
international partners would also be investors, without
elaborating.
    - Di Maio said that state-backed investment operator Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti could also be involved and help fund the
acquisition or lease a new fleet. The minister said that if
state-controlled companies like oil major Eni, the Post Office
and defence company Leonardo wanted to give a hand, this ""would
be interesting"".
    - A deadline for binding offers has been set for the end of
October, Di Maio added.
    - Alitalia was placed under special administration last year
and subsequently put up for sale. The government has lent it 900
million euros to keep it afloat during the sale process,
which was initially due to take six months.
    - The European Commission said in April the government’s
loan to Alitalia may constitute state aid.

officials worry that Italy's 2.4 percent of GDP budget gap for
2019, already seen as too high, could turn out to be even
higher, as deficit boosting measures in the draft budget have
not been well detailed and growth could be lower.
    Italy's populist government is to submit its 2019 draft
budget plan to Brussels on Monday for checks if it is in line
with EU rules -- the Stability and Growth Pact. The European
Commission has already said it is likely to break the rules.
    ""We don't know if the deficit will end up at 2.4 next year,
or maybe more. The measures are not specified in enough detail
to establish that and the gap may turn out bigger in the end
also because growth may be slower,"" one senior EU official said.
    Another senior EU official, also attending annual IMF and
World Bank meetings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali,
gave the same assessment of the prospects for Italy's budget
deficit.
    The EU vetting comes amid market concern over Italy's
borrowing plans, which triple the size of the gap planned by the
previous Italian administration, putting further strain on the
country's already bloated public finances where the debt to GDP
ratio is the second highest in Europe at 133 percent.
    Investors have been selling Italian paper since the deficit
plans were announced in late September and yields of 10-year
benchmark paper <IT10YT=TWEB> have risen to 4-1/2 year highs
above 3.5 percent.

    By Teis Jensen and tarmo virki
    COPENHAGEN/TALLINN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Danske Bank
<DANSKE.CO> said on Friday it has begun closing down parts of
its Estonian business which has been at the centre of an
investigation into alleged money laundering and prompted a U.S.
criminal investigation. 
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
transactions processed by Denmark's biggest bank via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank
said last month it thinks are suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    The bank said in April it would scale down its business in
the Baltic countries to focus on the Nordic markets.
    It said it would serve only subsidiaries of its Nordic
customers in the Baltics and global companies with business
interests in the Nordics. [nL8N1S31DG]
    ""We're writing to both private and corporate customers that
we have to close down their products and services,"" a Danske
Bank spokesman said on Friday.
    The Danske Bank case has triggered calls from politicians
and regulators for greater oversight of banks and a tightening
of European rules relating to anti-money laundering measures. It
has also cost the Danske Bank chief executive his job.
[nL8N1WL1G7]
    The Danske Bank spokesman would not say how many accounts it
is closing or how many jobs would be affected by the process,
which began in late April and will last for around a year.
    The time taken was due to the dialogue the bank had with
customers and the various notice terms, he added.
    Estonia's Ministry of Finance will close its accounts at
Danske Bank's Estonian branch as of the end of November.
    ""As Danske Bank has declared that in the future they will
concentrate only on servicing non-resident business clients and
their subsidiaries in Estonia, the Ministry does not deem it
necessary to have accounts there any more,"" a spokeswoman said.
    Estonia's Finance Ministry will this month present to the
government a plan for an independent report into alleged money
laundering in the country between 2007 and 2015. 
    It  will include proposals on how to right expert to
investigate and defining the exact objectives and scope of the
report, a spokeswoman for the ministry told Reuters.
    ""Including an independent expert will help to guarantee that
the government, as well as the public, will have a comprehensive
overview of the events and the situation at the time under
question from Estonia’s perspective,"" she said.
    ""The aim is to integrate all available relevant information
gathered by different inquiries into one comprehensive report,""
she added.

debt denominated in foreign currencies that it holds to zero,
which would take an overhauled debt-financing strategy, central
bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Friday, according to the
state news agency, MTI.
    The central bank is not in charge of debt-financing policy, 
but Matolcsy, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's former economy
minister, has implemented a string of programmes over the past
years to cut Hungary's exposure to foreign-currency debt.
    The measures have included a conversion of Hungarian
mortgage loans into forints just before the Swiss National Bank
abandoned its cap on the franc <CHFHUF=> in 2015 and cheap
refinancing loans for small businesses to convert their loans.
    Reducing the state foreign-currency debt should be Hungary's
top economic policy priority, MTI quoted Matolcsy as saying at a
business forum, in a summary of his remarks.
    Hungary issued 1 billion euros worth of eurobonds last month
as debt agency AKK tried to build up financing buffers through
the end of the year, while the government is locked in a dispute
with the European Commission over European Union funds.
    At the end of August, the debt denominated in foreign
currency as a proportion of total debt stood at 19.5 percent.
The AKK and the finance ministry could not immediately comment
on Matolcsy's remarks.
    Top central bankers have recently argued in favour of
channelling more household savings from short-term instruments
like bank deposits into government debt and stocks to bolster
the capital market and cut reliance on external funding.

    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Italy's finance
minister poured cold water on Friday on the idea, promoted by
the ruling League party, of giving tax breaks to Italian
citizens who invest in domestic government debt.
    Members of the far-right League, including party leader and
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, have been pushing for a
scheme of incentives to boost the share of Italy's 2.3 trillion
euro debt held domestically. 
    Discouraged by falling returns, Italians have come to hold
just around 5 percent of Rome's debt pile. 
    The proposal comes at a time when Italy's debt costs are
soaring due to declining demand from foreign investors, who
worry about the government's plans to run higher deficits in
defiance of European Union rules.  
    Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, a technocrat with no party
affiliation, defended Italy's much criticised expansionary
fiscal policy but distanced himself from the proposed scheme of
tax incentives.
    ""I've read about this measure in the papers and it has never
been discussed at the Treasury,"" Tria told reporters at the
International Monetary Fund's annual meetings in Indonesia.
    A source close to the matter told Reuters the Rome Treasury
dislikes the idea because preferential treatment for domestic
bonds would run counter to European rules.

International Monetary Fund's annual meetings in Indonesia.
    A source close to the matter told Reuters the Rome Treasury
dislikes the idea because preferential treatment for domestic
bonds would run counter to European rules.
    Traders and analysts say the mooted caps of 15 billion
euros, or 3,000 euros per person per year, mean the measures
would have scant impact in helping Italy refinancing around 400
billion euros of debt a year.
    Tria also gave short shrift to the notion, raised by Italy's
other deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, of Treasury
involvement in the rescue of troubled flagship carrier Alitalia.
Tria said this matter was only for the finance minister to
decide.
    He also argued for speeding up insolvency proceedings to
help banks solve their issues with unpaid loans.
    This has been a mantra for the European Central Bank and
previous Italian administrations, but could ruffle feathers in
the Five Star Movement, the left-leaning senior party in Italy's
ruling populist coalition. 
    Tria looks weak and isolated after he caved in to party
chiefs by agreeing to raise next year's fiscal deficit far above
levels agreed with Brussels. [nL8N1WP2GM]
    An economy ministry source and an institutional source told
Reuters last week that Tria had told aides he planned to resign
after the budget has been approved by parliament at the end of
the year.

    ATHENS/FRANKFURT, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Greece's largest lender
by assets, Piraeus Bank <BOPr.AT>, has told the European Central
Bank that it may miss a year-end target to raise capital because
of unfavourable financial markets, sources familiar with the
matter said.
    The ECB would like Piraeus to raise capital by the end of
this year, a target that the Greek lender has been working
towards, but rising bond yields have frustrated its attempts to
go to the market.
    Greece emerged from its latest bailout in August but its
banks are still fragile as they struggle to reduce their bad
loan pile stemming from the country's sovereign debt crisis. At
88 billion euros ($102 billion), the sector's soured debts
amount to nearly half the country's annual economic output. 
    Greek bank stocks have lost about half their value this
year, and the slide has been intensifying in recent days as a
rout in Italy's government bond market eroded appetite for
riskier euro zone assets. [nL8N1WO2TI]  
    Rising funding costs are in turn frustrating attempts by
weaker European banks to mend their balance sheets, at a time
when the ECB is keen to shore up the financial system against
the risk of another crisis.
    Piraeus has said it is implementing a capital enhancement
plan that will include a subordinate debt issue, a non-dilutive
Tier-2 bond to raise about 500 million euros.
    Earlier this month, Piraeus Chief Executive Christos Megalou
told Reuters the bank was in continuous dialogue with
supervisory authorities and monitoring debt capital markets for
a window of opportunity to issue the bond. [nL8N1WJ1YD]
    Piraeus shares have stabilised after a steep 37 percent fall
since the start of October, sparked in part by concerns over 
the bank's frustrated efforts to issue subordinated debt.
    ""We continue to monitor markets and when conditions are
right we will proceed with a Tier-2 issue,"" a senior source at
the bank told Reuters on Friday.
    The bank is likely to be given some flexibility in terms of
the timing, given the tough market conditions, said another
source at the bank. 
    Piraeus will not be in breach of capital rules if it misses
a Dec. 31 deadline, meaning the ECB will not have to sanction
the bank, this source said. 
    But the miss would be seen as a test of its supervisor's
resolve as the ECB is still testing how to enforce non-binding
expectations.
    The deadline is also seen as crucial as Daniele Nouy, the
head of the ECB's supervision unit, leaves at the end of the
year and may see the case as a test of her legacy. 
    One possible option to buy time would be to sell the Tier 2
instrument to Greece's bank rescue fund HFSF. Diluting
shareholders is not a preferred option for the bank, the source
said.
    The ECB declined to comment.

    LISBON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on
Friday upgraded Portugal's credit rating by one notch back to
investment grade, giving the once bailed-out country's debt full
eligibility to key bond indices and a wider investor base.
    Moody's, the last of the major credit rating agencies to
have kept Portugal's debt in ""junk"" territory after upgrades
last year by Fitch and Standard & Poor's, shifted Portugal to 
the lowest investment-grade mark of Baa3, with stable outlook,
citing the country's economic and fiscal improvements.
    ""Portugal's elevated general government debt has moved to a
sustainable, albeit gradual, downward trend, with limited risks
of reversal. The broadening of Portugal's growth drivers and a
structurally improved external position has increased economic
resilience,"" Moody's said in a statement.
    Moody's said Portugal's recent economic growth and fiscal
consolidation effort was stronger than it expected a year ago
and saw the decline in the debt levels to be ""relatively robust
to most likely shocks, including a modest rise in interest
rates"" expected to begin in Europe next year.
    Moody's change from speculative status will put Portugal's
bonds back into JP Morgan’s investment-grade bond indices,
completing its index eligibility. 
    Earlier upgrades by other raters had enabled its return to
several key indices used for portfolio purchases by buyers such
as pension funds and insurance firms.
    ""The positive evaluation by the ratings agencies contributes
to a wider and diversified investor base and helps to lower 
financing costs for households, companies and the state,"" the
finance ministry said in a statement, vowing to keep
strengthening the resilience of public accounts and the economy.
    S&P and Fitch rate Portugal's debt one and two notches into
investment grade territory, respectively.
    S&P last month affirmed its rating, but improved the outlook
to positive, saying that a rating upgrade was possible if the
country's stays the course of reducing public and private debt
while improving its financial stability.
    Portugal's economy grew at its strongest pace since the turn
of the century last year, continuing its recovery from a deep 
recession in 2011-13, and the government expects to slash the
budget deficit to just 0.7 percent this year, the lowest mark in
more than four decades of the country's democratic history.
    It plans to narrow the budget gap further to around 0.2
percent next year and eliminate the deficit by 2020. 
    Portugal's government debt fell by 4.5 percentage points in
2017 to just below 125 percent of GDP, driven by strong economic
growth and a healthy primary surplus, and Moody's expects the
debt burden to reach around 116 percent by 2021.

agency S&P Global to upgrade Poland's rating will attract more
investors and proves that the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party
has taken the right path with its reforms, Prime Minister
Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday. 
    S&P Global raised its rating on Poland by one notch to A- on
Friday, citing the country's strong economic growth and fiscal
performance. [nL8N1WS5SZ]
    ""This decision means attracting a bigger number of investors
to Poland. It means safety on the financial markets,"" Morawiecki
told private radio RMF FM. 
    S&P had cut Poland's rating at the start of 2016, saying the
new PiS government, which took power in late 2015, was weakening
the independence of key state institutions.
    ""For me this is a road sign that we are moving in the right
direction from the perspective of Polish families, Polish
citizens. It also confirms that it is not so bad when it comes
to institutional reforms, judiciary reforms,"" Morawiecki said. 
    Under the rule of PiS, a conservative, nationalist party, 
Poland has grown increasingly isolated within the European
Union, which it joined in 2004, because of concerns in Brussels
that PiS was undermining democratic standards.
    Poland's president named 27 new judges to the Supreme Court
on Wednesday as part of a judiciary reform pursued by the ruling
party that has triggered an EU lawsuit. [nL8N1WQ234]

    By Amanda Ferguson
    BELFAST, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The head of the Northern Irish
party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May's
government said on Saturday she would prefer no Brexit deal to a
bad deal, describing current plans as amounting to ""the
annexation of Northern Ireland"" by the EU.
    British and European Union negotiators this month have
accelerated the push for a Brexit deal but talks remain snagged
on the issue of the border between Northern Ireland, which is
part of the UK, and the Irish Republic, an EU member state.
    In the absence of a comprehensive EU-UK trade partnership
after Brexit, the EU is seeking a ""backstop"" arrangement whereby
Northern Ireland would effectively remain subject to the bloc's
regulations to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
    But the DUP, whose support May needs to pass legislation in
the British parliament, vehemently opposes any proposals under
which the province would be treated differently to the rest of
the UK.
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' (Brexit) but
the dangers of a bad deal are worse,"" Foster wrote in an article
in the Belfast Telegraph published on Saturday.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules
made in a place where we have no say,"" she added. 
    Britain wants any 'backstop' arrangement to be time-limited.
Hardline supporters of Brexit in May's ruling Conservative Party
fear it could be used to keep the whole UK inside a customs
union indefinitely with the EU.
    The EU is opposed to any specific cut-off date.

    In an article in another Northern Ireland newspaper, the
Belfast News Letter, former British foreign minister Boris
Johnson also took aim at the backstop, describing May's
agreement to accept a backstop as a ""dreadful mistake"".

    By Jan Strupczewski
    NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 13 (Reuters) - As the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis petered out, European officials at annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund were happy to move
out of the spotlight over recent years. Europe was not in the
eye of the storm. 
    Until now.
    The IMF's annual meetings, normally held in Washington, this
year is taking place on the Indonesian resort island of Bali,
where a magnitude six earthquake welcomed the world's 20 top
finance ministers on the eve of their talks.
    But the tremor, which awoke many of the 10,000 officials
from all over he world around 3 o'clock in the morning on
Thursday, turned out to be less of a conversation topic than a
new menace to Europe's financial stability - Italy.
    ""If you talk to serious people here, everybody talks about
Italy,"" one European official said. 
    Investors and bank analysts at meetings with European
decision-makers were mainly interested in Italy and how the euro
zone could deal with it, officials said.
    ""The main topics at the meetings here are the trade war
between the U.S. and China and Italy,"" a second European
participant said. 
    ""On Italy, people ask us what is likely to happen and how we
are going to deal with it. They are alarmed but not in panic."" 
    Italy's new, populist government wants to increase borrowing
over the next three years to make good on election promises of
higher spending and lower taxes. 
    But with a debt pile of 133 percent of GDP, the second
highest in Europe after Greece, and relatively slow growth, Rome
can hardly afford such luxuries. 
    Markets also fret that Italian banks, saddled with bad
loans, and a massive amount of Italian government bonds, could
face crippling losses if debt prices keep tumbling. 
    Financial markets reacted to the Rome's plans with a sharp
sell-off of Italian bonds - three-year yields rose to five year
highs at an auction on Thursday and the benchmark 10-year paper
<IT10YT=TWEB> traded at 4-1/2-year highs.     
    The higher deficit also blatantly breaks European Union
budget rules, enforced by the European Commission, putting Rome
on a collision course with EU institutions once it sends the
draft budget for EU checks on Monday.
    
    TALKING THEMSELVES INTO PANIC
    Many officials are privately concerned about the possibility
of Italy sparking another sovereign debt crisis like the one
triggered by Greece in 2010 that nearly destroyed the euro zone.
Only Italy's economy is almost 10 times bigger than Greece's.
    But some also caution against doomsday scenarios.
    ""Here in Bali, something is happening that I have seen in
IMF meetings again and again. People focus on something that is
difficult and then everybody talks about it and, in the end,
everybody is convinced that it is much worse than before they
started. That is happening now with Italy,"" a third European
official said.
    ""I am worried, but it is not quite as bad as some people
here make it to be. They talk themselves into a panic,"" he said.
    Speaking at a panel on Thursday, Klaus Regling, the head of
the euro zone's bailout fund that would be called upon if Italy
could no longer borrow at sustainable rates, noted the euro
zone's third biggest economy had inherent strengths.
    Regling stressed Italy had a primary and current account
surplus, large private savings and that most of Italian debt was
held domestically, which made capital flight less likely.
    ""There is no immediate danger for Italy to lose access to
the markets,"" Regling told the panel.
    But Fitch ratings agency downgraded the outlook for Italy's
debt at the beginning of September and Moody's is waiting until
the end October to complete its review for a possible downgrade
of Italy's Baa2 rating. Standard & Poor's will assess Italy on
Oct 26.
    Regling said he did not believe Rome would lose its
investment grade rating, but other officials said that while a
downgrade by two notches may be unlikely, the ratings agencies
could also cut their outlook and that market reaction was
difficult to predict.
    ""Italian debt is sustainable unless there are serious policy
mistakes. At the moment they are making serious policy mistakes.
You can ruin any country if you do the wrong things,"" the third
official said.

    By Amanda Ferguson
    BELFAST, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The head of the Northern Irish
party that props up British Prime Minister Theresa May's
government is ""ready"" to trigger a no-deal Brexit and now
regards it as the ""likeliest outcome,"" The Observer newspaper
reported on Saturday, citing a leaked email.
    The newspaper said Arlene Foster told Ashley Fox, leader of
Conservative Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), she had
a ""hostile and difficult"" exchange at her meeting this week with
Michel Barnier, the French official leading the European Union's
negotiating team.
    ""AF said the DUP were ready for a no deal scenario, which
she now believed was the likeliest one,"" according to the email,
whose sender or recipient the newspaper did not identify.
    The Observer said it was one of several emails ""leaked from
the highest levels of government"" that it had seen.
    A DUP spokesman declined to comment beyond what Foster wrote
for an article published in Saturday's Belfast Telegraph. In it,
Foster said she would prefer no Brexit deal to a bad deal,
describing current plans as amounting to ""the annexation of
Northern Ireland"" by the EU.
    British and European Union negotiators this month
accelerated the push for a Brexit deal but talks remain snagged
over the issue of the border between Northern Ireland, which is
part of the UK, and the Irish Republic, an EU member state.
    Without a comprehensive EU-UK trade partnership after
Brexit, the EU is seeking a ""backstop"" arrangement whereby
Northern Ireland would effectively remain subject to the bloc's
regulations to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
    But the DUP, whose support May needs to pass legislation in
the British parliament, vehemently opposes any proposals that
treat the province differently from the rest of the UK.
    ""I fully appreciate the risks of a 'no deal' (Brexit) but
the dangers of a bad deal are worse,"" Foster wrote in the
Belfast Telegraph article.
    ""This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would
be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the
rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules
made in a place where we have no say,"" she added.
    
    ""NO GAME""
    Britain wants any 'backstop' arrangement to be time-limited.
Hardline supporters of Brexit in May's ruling Conservative Party
fear it could be used to indefinitely keep the entire UK inside
a customs union with the EU.
    The EU is opposed to any specific cut-off date.
    Foster said her party, which has 10 lawmakers in the UK
parliament, was not bluffing in its tough stance.
    ""This is no game. Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted
way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we
will make in the coming weeks,"" Foster said.
    ""The coming days, weeks and months will be critical. The
decisions taken will shape the type of Northern Ireland that our
grandchildren will live in.""
    Foster said she wanted a workable deal for both Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and would travel to Dublin
for talks on Monday.

Belfast News Letter, former British foreign minister Boris
Johnson also took aim at the backstop, describing May's
agreement to accept it as a ""dreadful mistake.""

    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo
Salvini on Sunday defended his decision to move hundreds of
migrants out of a southern Italian town widely seen as a model
of successful integration as opposition groups accused him of
racism.
    Riace, a small town in Calabria, Italy's southern toe, has
been in the spotlight since its mayor, Domenico Lucano, was
arrested this month for allegedly favouring illegal immigration,
sparking protests by residents and pro-migrant groups.
[nL8N1WI367]
    Salvini, leader of the right-wing League, celebrated the
arrest, and this weekend announced that Riace's mainly African
migrants would be moved out and spread around the country.
    He said the decision was necessary to end abuses in the use
of funds that previous governments had made available to the
town for its projects to house and integrate migrants.
    ""We cannot tolerate irregularities in the use of public
money, even under the excuse of spending it for migrants,"" said
Salvini, whose party's support has surged on the back of his
tough line against illegal immigration.  
    The decision was met with a barrage of criticism on Sunday
from the leftist opposition and pro-migrant activists.
    ""We have to say with force that the action undertaken by
Salvini against the Riace model is a vile act,"" said Nicola
Zingaretti, president of the central Lazio region, who is
bidding for leadership of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).
    Riace's integration efforts have won prizes and drawn
international acclaim for opening the town's doors to thousands
of refugees, integrating them into society and revitalising a
dwindling local population.
    Over 300 citizens of Riace's 2,000 inhabitants are
immigrants, according to deputy mayor Giuseppe Gervasi. Over the
years the town has welcomed hundreds more but many have moved on
to other European countries, he said.
    Lucano, who has been mayor since 2002, was listed by Fortune
magazine as one of the world's top 50 leaders in 2016.
    Salvini said there would be no turning back and accused the
PD of hypocrisy, saying the investigation into the misuse of
funds in Riace had been launched by Marco Minniti, interior
minister under the previous, PD-led government in 2017.
    The head of Italy's network of migrant reception centres
said there was no question of migrants housed in Riace being
deported, and they would be found alternative places to stay
elsewhere in Italy.
    The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which governs with
the League, has given Salvini a free hand in pursuing his
immigration clampdown, which has focused mainly on preventing
migrant boats from Libya arriving on Italy's shores.

    BERLIN, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's

    CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been a thorn in Merkel's side
since her 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to more than 1
million migrants, gradually shifting his party to the right in
an ultimately futile effort to counter the rise of the AfD.
    Divisions between Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and
the CSU - conservative sister parties - have widened further
since an inconclusive national election forced them into a
coalition in March with the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD).
    The Bavarian election is followed in two weeks by another
test for Merkel's conservative alliance: her CDU is likely to
remain the largest party but lose votes in a regional vote in
the western state of Hesse, home to the financial centre of
Frankfurt.
    The CDU then holds its annual congress in December, when
Merkel will seek re-election as party chairwoman - a bid senior
conservatives have backed despite the parliamentary party
ousting her ally, Volker Kauder, as leader last month.

    By Michael Nienaber and Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Bavarian allies suffered their worst election result since 1950
on Sunday, bleeding votes to the far-right in a setback that
risks widening divisions within Germany's crisis-prone national
government.
    The Christian Social Union (CSU) won 35.5 percent of the
vote, an exit poll for broadcaster ARD showed, losing its
absolute majority for only the second time since 1962 - an
outcome sure to stoke infighting in the conservative party,
already a difficult partner for Merkel in Berlin.
    ""Of course today is not an easy day for the CSU. We did not
achieve a good result,"" Bavarian premier Markus Soeder told a
gathering of his party. ""We accept the result with humility,"" he
said, adding that the CSU nonetheless wanted to form a stable
government as soon as possible.
    The result, which saw the pro-immigration Greens come second
and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter the state
assembly for the first time, means the CSU will need to form a
coalition - a humiliation for a party used to ruling alone.
    The Greens, who more than doubled their share of the vote to
18.5 percent, attracted support from more liberal CSU voters and
from those who traditionally vote for the left-leaning Social
Democrats (SPD), who won just 10 percent.
    CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been a thorn in Merkel's side
since her 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to more than 1
million migrants, gradually shifting his party to the right in
an ultimately futile effort to counter the rise of the AfD.
    Michael Weigl, political scientist at the University of
Passau, said personal attacks on Merkel by Seehofer - who is the
federal interior minister - and his hard-line rhetoric against
asylum seekers were to blame for the CSU's weak result. 
    ""This created a political climate of polarisation from which
the Greens and the AfD benefited the most, with their clear
stances on immigration,"" Weigl said. ""For the CSU, this strategy
backfired. I expect that Seehofer will have to step down as
interior minister.""
    The AfD won 11 percent of the vote, the exit poll showed.
The Free Voters, a protest party that is the CSU's most likely
coalition party, won 11.5 percent. The CSU has ruled out an
alliance with the AfD.
    
    IN-FIGHTING
    Divisions between Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and
the CSU - conservative sister parties - have widened further
since an inconclusive national election forced them into a
coalition in March with the Social Democrats.
    The Bavarian election is followed in two weeks by another
test for Merkel's conservative alliance: her CDU is likely to
remain the largest party but lose votes in a vote in the western

    Weigl described the Social Democrats' result in Bavaria as
an ""absolute catastrophe"" and said this meant tensions in
Merkel's government in Berlin could increase further.
    ""SPD leader Andrea Nahles will now feel the heat from
critics from the left-wing who warned against entering another
grand coalition with Merkel's conservatives,"" he said. ""The SPD
could become a less predictable, less comfortable coalition
partner.""

Di Maio on Sunday ruled out that the government could take the
country out of the euro zone, saying such talk was no more than
scaremongering by its political opponents.
    ""No-one need fear an exit from the euro or from the European
Union, there is no danger and no intention because that isn't
what the Italians asked of us at the election,"" Di Maio said in
an interview on private television station Canale 5.
    Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement
which governs with the right-wing League, told the station that
the opposition Democratic Party said the government wanted to
leave the euro ""because they want to scare people"".  
    Both the League and 5-Star once campaigned on an anti-euro
platform, but the former rivals ditched any plans to leave the
single currency when they joined forces to form a government in
June, following an inconclusive national election.
    However, financial markets remain nervous despite repeated
reiterations that ditching the euro is not in the government's
programme, and occasional eurosceptic comments by coalition
members have triggered sell-offs of Italian government bonds.
    An Ipsos opinion poll published on Saturday in daily
Corriere della Sera showed 61 percent of Italians wanted to keep
the euro, compared with just 27 percent who favoured a return to
Italy's old lira currency.

 (Adds preliminary results, SPD leader, analyst, detail)
    By Michael Nienaber, Paul Carrel and Jörn Poltz
    BERLIN/MUNICH, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Bavarian allies suffered their worst election result since 1950
on Sunday, bleeding votes to the far-right in a setback that
immediately raised tensions within Germany's crisis-prone
national government.
    The Christian Social Union (CSU) won 35.6 percent of the
vote, preliminary results showed, losing its absolute majority
for only the second time since 1962 - an outcome sure to stoke
infighting in the conservative party, already a difficult
partner for Merkel in Berlin.
    ""Of course today is not an easy day for the CSU. We did not
achieve a good result,"" Bavarian premier Markus Soeder told a
gathering of his party. ""We accept the result with humility,"" he
said, adding that the CSU nonetheless wanted to form a stable
government as soon as possible.
    The result, which saw the pro-immigration Greens come second
and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter the state
assembly for the first time, means the CSU will need to form a
coalition - a humiliation for a party used to ruling alone.
    The Greens, who more than doubled their share of the vote to
18.3 percent, attracted support from more liberal CSU voters and
from those who traditionally vote for the left-leaning Social
Democrats (SPD), who won just 9.7 percent.
    ""The political earthquake was in Bavaria, but the
aftershocks will be felt in Berlin ... Talk will increase ever
more about the end of the Merkel era,"" said Fred Kempe,
president of the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank.
    Without naming Merkel, SPD leader Andrea Nahles said the
""poor performance"" of the federal government in Berlin was one
of the reasons for her party's weak showing in Bavaria. ""It's
clear that something has to change,"" she said.
    
    THORN IN MERKEL'S SIDE 
    CSU leader Horst Seehofer has been a thorn in Merkel's side
since her 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to more than 1
million migrants, gradually shifting his party to the right in
an ultimately futile effort to counter the rise of the AfD.
    Michael Weigl, political scientist at the University of
Passau, said personal attacks on Merkel by Seehofer - who is the
federal interior minister - and his hard-line rhetoric against
asylum seekers were to blame for the CSU's weak result. 
    ""This created a political climate of polarisation from which
the Greens and the AfD benefited the most, with their clear
stances on immigration,"" Weigl said. ""For the CSU, this strategy
backfired.""
    Asked if he would resign as CSU leader, Seehofer told ZDF
broadcaster that he wasn't ruling this out but there were many
reasons for the party's weak result which now had to be analysed
prudently.  
    The AfD won 10.9 percent of the vote, the preliminary
results showed. The Free Voters, a protest party that is the
CSU's most likely coalition party, won 11.6 percent. The CSU has
ruled out an alliance with the AfD.
    
    INFIGHTING
    Divisions between Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and
the CSU - conservative sister parties - have widened further
since an inconclusive national election forced them into a
coalition in March with the Social Democrats.
    The Bavarian election is followed in two weeks by another
test for Merkel's conservative alliance: her CDU is likely to
remain the largest party but lose votes in an election in the
western state of Hesse, home to the financial centre of
Frankfurt.
    The CDU then holds its annual congress in December, when
Merkel will seek re-election as party chairwoman - a bid senior
conservatives have backed despite the parliamentary party
ousting her ally, Volker Kauder, as leader last month.
    Before the Bavarian vote, Merkel urged her CDU and CSU
allies to end their infighting. [nL8N1WM0ER]
    Her fourth and probably final government has already come
close to collapsing twice, in arguments over immigration and a
scandal over Germany's former domestic spymaster, while
simmering rows over phasing out polluting diesel cars and
whether to lower taxes for the rich threaten to boil over.
[nL8N1WQ4A1]
    ""Now all eyes are on the next state election in Hesse,"" said
Kempe, at the Atlantic Council. ""If things go badly there, the
calls for Merkel to step down will increase."" [nL8N1WS562]

    BERLIN/MUNICH, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
Bavarian allies suffered their worst election result since 1950

    LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Britain must stand up to bullies
in the European Union and press for a ""super Canada"" free trade
deal, former foreign minister Boris Johnson said, increasing
pressure on his former boss, Prime Minister Theresa May, over
Brexit.
    In his weekly column in the Telegraph newspaper to be
published on Monday, Johnson, who was the figurehead of the
campaign to leave the EU, said the Brexit negotiations were
entering a ""moment of crisis"" and that May should change tack.
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU in
its biggest shift in trade and foreign policy in more than 40
years, the latest round of talks in Brussels failed to clinch a
deal on Britain's divorce terms, with negotiators pausing
negotiations just days before a leaders' summit. [nL8N1WU0H1]
    Johnson, the bookmakers' favourite to replace May, is the
latest critic to redouble efforts to urge the prime minister to
rethink her plan to leave the EU. [nL8N1WU0CV]
    ""There comes a point when you have to stand up to bullies.
After more than two years of being ruthlessly pushed around by
the EU, it is time for the UK to resist,"" he wrote.
    ""There is a better solution ... It is the Super Canada, zero
tariff, zero quota, free trade deal at the heart of a deep and
special partnership. It is right for both sides, and it is time
to go for it.""
    The latest round of Brexit talks faltered over the so-called
backstop arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border
between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member
Ireland, a part of the withdrawal agreement on divorce terms.
    EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the two sides could
still not bridge a gap between his demands that Northern Ireland
stay in the EU's economic zone and London's rejection of any
checks on trade between the province and the British mainland.
    Brexit campaigners, like Johnson, are also fearful the
government is trying to agree a non time-limited backstop to
keep the whole country inside a customs union with the EU
indefinitely - something they say will not deliver Brexit.
    May insists any customs arrangement as part of the backstop
must be temporary, but the EU has refused to set an end date.
    ""In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of
the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt,""
Johnson wrote.
    ""It is time to scrap the backstop, and simply agree what is
manifestly the case - that no one wants any new physical checks
at the northern Irish border, and nor is there any need for
them."" 
    Instead, he said, Britain should pursue an enhanced version
of the Canada free trade deal with the EU.
    ""We still have ample time to make it work,"" he wrote.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields felt
downward pressure on Monday as investors moved into less risky
assets on lingering risk-events such as U.S.-Saudi tensions,
Italy's budget and a lack of progress in Brexit talks. 
    German government bond yields remained close to two-week
lows after a strong performance following a shaky start for
global equity markets, with analysts citing a plethora of global
risks as the drivers of sentiment. This included a state
election in Bavaria at the weekend which delivered humiliating
results for parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition
government. 
    Escalating tensions between the United States and Saudi
Arabia over the disappearance of Washington Post journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, a stall in Brexit talks over the weekend, and
concerns over Italy's budget helped boost the bid for Bunds.
[nL8N1WU0H1][nL8N1WU0ED]
    This added to gains made on Friday after comments by
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, tempering the euro
zone's inflation outlook. [nL8N1WS26B] 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the region,
was last at 0.489 percent, opened decisively below 0.5 percent
at 0.48 percent, it's lowest level in almost two-weeks, having
last week recorded its strongest performance since August.
<DE10YT=RR>.
    The disastrous state election for Merkel's Bavarian allies
did little to derail the bid either. [nL8N1WT0IH]
    ""This reflects the ongoing lack of trust and likeablity of
the grand coalition (but) we need to see how that is reflected
in Berlin,"" said Christian Lenk, rates strategist at DZ Bank.
""The safe haven character (of Bunds) is the dominant moving
part.""
    Elsewhere, Portugal's rating were upgraded on Friday by
Moody's though this failed to give any significant boost to bond
yields which remained pinned near five month highs. [nL3N1WV2G4]
  
    Portugal's government bond yields opened around flat to one
basis point lower on Monday with its five year yield at 0.86
percent, and its 10-year yield at 2.02 percent <PT5YT=RR>,
<PT10YT=RR>.
    Moody's became the last of the big three ratings agencies
since the euro zone bond crisis to lift Portugal from junk
status. Moody's upgraded Portugal to Baa3 from Ba1.  
    While the move is unlikely to unlock fresh flows of capital
as Portugal is already part of the largest investment grade
indexes, it may help convince those investors who take a more
stringent view.
    ""Some investors take a fairly conservative view and if the
worst of the (ratings) improves, that may encourage them to come
back in,"" said Antoine Bouvet, rates strategist at Mizuho. 
    Portugal is rated BBB by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch. 
    Lower bond yields were seen across the euro zone, with even
Italian bond yields lower ahead of a cabinet meeting to approve
the controversial 2019 budget later on. 
    Horse-trading between Italy and international bodies such as
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund continued
over the weekend. But markets appear soothed after Italy's
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio on Sunday ruled out that the
government could take the country out of the euro zone, saying
such talk was no more than scaremongering by its political
opponents. [nL8N1WU0S4]
    Italy should abide by European budget rules and must settle
its differences with Brussels over higher state spending in
talks with the European Union's executive, a senior
International Monetary Fund official was quoted on Sunday as

 (Adds key ministers meet ahead of cabinet, gvt bond yields)
    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Italian cabinet was due to meet
on Monday to approve a 2019 budget which envisages a jump in the
deficit that has upset financial markets and drawn criticism
from the European Commission and other international bodies.
    The government, backed by the right-wing League and the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has already issued the
financial framework for the budget, raising the target for next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.
[nL8N1WL29P]
    That is comfortably below the EU's 3 percent ceiling, but up
sharply from a targeted 1.8 percent this year, flouting EU rules
which call on highly-debt countries like Italy to narrow the
deficit steadily towards a balanced budget.
    The reaction from Brussels has been fierce, with EU
commissioners threatening to reject the package before even
formally receiving it, and triggering a war of words with the
ruling parties in Rome. [nL8N1WR4D0] [nL8N1WP61S] 
    With many aspects of the budget measures still to be
defined, an inner circle of key ministers was due to meet in the
morning, ahead of the full cabinet, scheduled for later in the
day.  
    The Commission says the budget will push up Italy's public
debt which already amounts to 131 percent of GDP,
proportionately the highest in the euro zone after Greece's,
rejecting Rome's argument that the expansionary package can
lower debt by boosting economic growth.
    The budget marks ""a change of gear for Italy"", Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday, adding that he was
confident the EU would soften its stance after the government
has had the chance to explain its growth strategy properly.
    Italy must send its planned fiscal framework to Brussels on
Monday, and the Commission can reject it and ask for changes,
setting off a possible process of negotiations.
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said last week the deficit
would rise by 22 billion euros ($25.5 billion) next year, with
37 billion euros in spending projects and tax cuts partly offset
by 15 billion of extra revenues and spending cuts in other
areas.
    Ministers have said about 10 billion euros will be devoted
to 5-Star's flagship policy of a basic income for the poor,
while around 8 billion will finance a lowering of the retirement
age. Less than a billion will go to fund tax cuts for the
self-employed, a project championed in particular by the League.
    After the cabinet approves the budget it will pass to
parliament, where it must be passed before the end of the year.
    Despite international criticism and a sell-off of Italy's
government bonds, the budget is popular with Italians. A survey
by pollster Demopolis on Friday showed 52 percent backed the
plan, compared with 38 percent who gave it the thumbs down.
    Italy's five year government bond yield was down eight basis
points to 2.98 percent, with its 10-year three basis points
lower at 3.55 percent IT5YT=RR, IT10YT=RR.

said on Monday.
    Speaking as he arrived to meet fellow EU ministers in

he believed a deal was still possible after a summit this week.
     ""For us it's about following through on the commitments
that have already been made,"" he said. ""We're not looking for
anything new here, we're simply looking for the commitments that
were made last December, and in particular last March, to be
followed through on.""
    ""I think we are frustrated, but we're still pretty calm
about that,"" Coveney said when asked if he was frustrated by the
breakdown of talks, which came after renewed British refusal to
accept a backstop that would create a customs border between
Northern Ireland and the mainland if no better deal were found.
    ""Time is moving on, ratification mechanisms are going to
take time,"" Coveney said, noting the urgency to reach a deal
well before Britain leaves the European Union in March.
    ""I think there was a real effort over the last 10 days by
the two negotiating teams to intensify engagement so that they
could have a set of recommendations for political leaders this
week,"" he said. ""That hasn't proven possible.
    ""That is frustrating and disappointing from an Irish
perspective.""         
    ""For us we want to see an outcome here that settles nerves,
that allows us to move ahead with a managed, sensible Brexit. I
still think it's possible to do that, but clearly it's going to
take a bit more time than many people had hoped.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A row between the eurosceptic
Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget could escalate in the coming days if the EU Commission
decided to trigger a procedure to reject the Italian budgetary
plans.
    The unprecedented move would formally begin a long legal
dispute that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy
until it is resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but has so far not been applied to any member
of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the possible
procedure and of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Oct. 15: This is the deadline for euro zone states to submit
to the EU Commission their draft budgets for the following year.
     
    Oct. 22: After the submission of draft plans, the Commission
has one week to identify ""particularly serious non-compliance
with the budgetary policy obligations"" of a state. Assuming
Italy submits its draft budget on Oct. 15, as is common
practice, the Commission will have until Oct. 22 to make its
concerns known to Italy.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to a run a structural surplus of 0.6
percent of its Gross Domestic Product in 2019, but the
government's new plans foresee instead a structural deficit of
0.8 percent of GDP. The structural balance excludes one-off
expenditures, for emergencies or natural catastrophes.  
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of 130 percent of GDP, which should instead fall,
under EU rules.
    
   Oct. 29: If the Commission decided to consider Italy's draft
budget non-compliant with EU rules, it has to reject it within
two weeks of submission. This deadline would expire on Oct. 29
if Italy submits its budget on Oct 15. Brussels would have to
explain in a written opinion its reasons for sending the budget
back to Rome for changes. 
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
regular monthly meeting which would put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 19: In the event its budget were rejected by the
Commission, the Italian government would have three weeks from
the date of the EU opinion to submit a revised budget. This
deadline would expire on Nov. 19 if the Commission's opinion was
adopted on Oct. 29.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 10: The Commission would have three weeks, likely until
Dec. 10, from the submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt
a new opinion in which it would describe Italy's overall
budgetary position and its impact on the whole euro zone.
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission is expected
to publish its economic forecasts up to 2020, which would show
whether EU calculations match Italy's growth, debt and deficit
projections which underpin budget targets. The data could pave
the way to sanction procedures if EU and Italian data differed
widely.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines. 
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just few
weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Oil group Cepsa,
LeasePlan and Tencent Music have delayed floats due to the stock
market selloff. That reasoning is dicey when others have listed
without much of a hitch. Tricky IPOs need buoyant investors.

has retracted significantly, along with their willingness to
participate in stock market listings such as the one being
carried out by Cepsa,"" it said.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A row between the eurosceptic
Italian government and the European Union over Italy's 2019
budget could escalate in the coming days if the EU Commission
decided to trigger a procedure to reject the Italian budgetary
plans.
    The unprecedented move would formally begin a long legal
dispute that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy
until it is resolved. 
    The procedure has been part of the European Commission's
toolbox to ensure euro zone countries' compliance with EU fiscal
rules since 2013, but has so far not been applied to any member
of the 19-country currency bloc.
    Below are the key dates and deadlines of the possible
procedure and of relevant EU meetings:
    
    Oct. 15: This is the deadline for euro zone states to submit
to the EU Commission their draft budgets for the following year.
     
    Oct. 22: After the submission of draft plans, the Commission
has one week to identify ""particularly serious non-compliance
with the budgetary policy obligations"" of a state. Assuming
Italy submits its draft budget on Oct. 15, as is common
practice, the Commission will have until Oct. 22 to make its
concerns known to Italy.
    Under EU rules, countries' draft budgets should be
consistent with economic recommendations agreed earlier with the
Commission and euro zone peers. 
    In May, Italy committed to cutting its structural deficit by
0.6 points in 2019. But the government's new plans foresee
instead a rise in the structural deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP.
The structural balance excludes one-off expenditures, for
emergencies or natural catastrophes.
    A structural deterioration is likely to increase Italy's
huge debt of more than 130 percent of GDP, which should instead
fall, under EU rules.
    
   Oct. 29: If the Commission decided to consider Italy's draft
budget non-compliant with EU rules, it has to reject it within
two weeks of submission. This deadline would expire on Oct. 29
if Italy submits its budget on Oct 15. Brussels would have to
explain in a written opinion its reasons for sending the budget
back to Rome for changes. 
    
    Nov. 5: The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers holds a
regular monthly meeting which would put further pressure on Rome
to change its draft budget. 
    
    Nov. 19: In the event its budget were rejected by the
Commission, the Italian government would have three weeks from
the date of the EU opinion to submit a revised budget. This
deadline would expire on Nov. 19 if the Commission's opinion was
adopted on Oct. 29.
    
    Dec. 3: Monthly Eurogroup meeting.
    
    Dec. 10: The Commission would have three weeks, likely until
Dec. 10, from the submission of Italy's amended budget to adopt
a new opinion in which it would describe Italy's overall
budgetary position and its impact on the whole euro zone.
    
    Dec. 13: The European Central Bank's Governing Council holds
a monetary policy meeting that is set to wrap up its bond
purchase programme, a widely expected move that could, however,
further increase Italy's spiralling debt servicing costs.
    
    Dec. 14: EU leaders at their regular end-of-year summit
would likely discuss Italy's budgetary plans if no solution was
found at this stage, further increasing market and peer pressure
on Rome.
    
    Feb. 4-7: This is the week when the Commission is expected
to publish its economic forecasts up to 2020, which would show
whether EU calculations match Italy's growth, debt and deficit
projections which underpin budget targets. The data could pave
the way to sanction procedures if EU and Italian data differed
widely.
    
    FOLLOWING STEPS 
    If Italy refused to change its draft budget, the Commission
could open an excessive deficit procedure against Rome, which
would likely push Italy again into the market spotlight, and
could also trigger fines. 
    Sanctions procedures are usually started by the Commission
when final data are available over a two-year period, which
would mean that this decision would come in April 2019, just few
weeks before the May's European Parliament elections.
    EU officials have, however, said that they are not legally
bound to start such a procedure in April and could do it
earlier, if needed. 
    In addition to this, under EU rules the Commission can send
an ""early warning"" letter anytime to states that show a
significant deviation from their targets. 
    These letters have usually been sent after the publication
of EU's quarterly economic forecasts. The warnings, if unheeded,
could also trigger financial sanctions.

 (Updates with more details, comment)
    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Portuguese and Italian government
bond yields fell on Monday, outperforming euro zone peers after
ratings agency Moody's upgraded Portugal's credit rating by one
notch back to investment grade and Italy's budget plans returned
to focus.
    Moody's is the last of the big three ratings agencies to
lift Portugal from the junk status acquired during the euro zone
debt crisis.
    Moody's upgraded Portugal to Baa3 from Ba1 after the close
of European markets on Friday, citing economic and fiscal
improvements. [nL8N1WS4W6]
    The move is unlikely to unlock fresh flows of capital as
Portugal is already part of the largest investment grade
indexes, but analysts said the upgrade may help to convince
investors who take a more stringent view. 
    ""The upgrade is still a positive point. Even though it is
not surprising, it may make investors have a second look at
Portuguese government bonds,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist
Christian Lenk. 
    Portugal's bond yields fell by up to four basis points.
Ten-year bond yields dipped briefly below 2 percent before
pulling back to 2.01 percent, down 1.5 bps on the day.
<PT10YT=RR>
    Italy's 10-year bond yield was down two bps at 3.56 percent.
<IT10YT=RR>
    Cabinet approval of Italy's 2019 budget has been delayed by
one day to Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on
Monday. Government sources said there were tensions between the
ruling coalition parties over plans for a partial tax amnesty.
[nR1N1VZ00W]
    ""The budget numbers have converged to a reasonable
compromise,"" said Nordea Chief Analyst Jan von Gerich. 
    ""But I don't think the numbers are credible and the targets
won't but met, but the biggest sell-off in Italy is behind us.""
    In contrast to Portugal and Italy, Spain's 10-year bond
yield hit fresh one-year highs at 1.706 percent <ES10YT=RR>. 
    Spain's Socialists, who hold a minority in parliament,
reached a budget deal on Thursday with anti-austerity party
Podemos that includes tax hikes and raising the minimum wage.
[nL8N1WR24E]
    ""We have started to see many accounts worrying about the
fiscal situation of Spain. We have been answering many questions
over this weekend, many investors are asking are the
implications of the new agreement between Podemos and the
Socialists,"" said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche. 
    Elsewhere, yields on higher-rated euro zone bonds dipped as
investors moved into less risky assets as U.S.-Saudi tensions
and Brexit talks dragged on.
    A weekend election in the German state of Bavaria that
delivered humiliating results for parties in Chancellor Angela
Merkel's coalition government may also have helped lift appetite
for safe-haven bonds. [nL8N1WV1BT]
    Germany's 10-year bond yield dipped to 0.478 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, its lowest in almost two weeks.

    PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - At least 13 people have been
killed in southwestern France by some of the worst flash floods
in a century, local authorities said on Monday.
    Television pictures showed raging, muddy rivers - swollen by
torrential rain - that had uprooted trees, knocked over concrete
power pylons and swept away cars in the southern region of Aude,
near the medieval hilltop city of Carcassonne.
    National emergency services spokesman Michael Bernier said
13 people had been killed and one person was still missing.
Thousands were being evacuated from the area, where officials
said up to seven months' worth of rain had fallen overnight. 
    ""The death toll risks going up,"" a spokesman for the
Interior Ministry told BFM TV.
    Seven helicopters were scrambled to rescue people from the
roofs of their homes, and rough weather was making operations
difficult, the prefect of Aude, Alain Thirion, said. 
    ""We have people stranded on rooftops. We're going to have to
use aircraft to evacuate them because we cannot reach them by
boat given the force of the water. It's too dangerous,"" he said.
    Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who will be heading to the
disaster zone on Monday, said 350 firemen were helping the
rescue effort and up to 350 more would be drafted in.
    ""We're being kept informed of the situation hour by hour,""
he said.
    Among the worst hit areas were the villages of
Conques-sur-Orbiel and Villardonnel, where the water rose as
high as the first-floor windows of some houses. The Aude region
is a popular tourist destination with ancient towns and villages
in its hilly peaks stretching down to the Mediterranean.
    The flash floods struck without warning. At least one victim
was swept away by raging waters while sleeping, Thirion said. 
    Water levels were expected to keep rising after more heavy
rain. Schools were shut and residents told to stay at home.
    The Vigicrues agency, which tracks water levels in France,
said the flooding was nearing a peak last seen in 1891.
    Torrential rain is not uncommon in France at this time of
year, but meteorologists have said exceptionally warm sea water
along the Mediterranean coast may be intensifying the rains. 
    The year so far is France's hottest since 1900, according to
the state meteorological service.

 (Adds approval of law on Tuesday, spread of govt yields)
    By Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet was due to meet
later on Monday but the approval of the 2019 budget, which
envisages a jump in the deficit that has upset financial markets
and drawn criticism from the European Commission, slipped to
Tuesday.
    The government, backed by the right-wing League and the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has already issued the
financial framework for the budget, raising the target for next
year's deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.
[nL8N1WL29P]
    That is comfortably below the EU's 3 percent ceiling, but up
sharply from a targeted 1.8 percent this year, flouting EU rules
which call on highly-debt countries like Italy to narrow the
deficit steadily towards a balanced budget.
    The reaction from Brussels has been fierce, with EU
commissioners threatening to reject the package before even
formally receiving it, and triggering a war of words with the
ruling parties in Rome. [nL8N1WR4D0] [nL8N1WP61S] 
    With many aspects of the budget measures still to be
defined, key government ministers met ahead of the full cabinet
session set for the evening.
    But Deputy PM Luigi Di Maio stayed away reflecting what 
government sources said were tensions between his 5-Star
Movement and their ruling allies, the far-right League, over
plans for a partial tax amnesty to be included in the fiscal
decree, a separate law linked to the budget.  
    The Commission says the budget will push up Italy's public
debt which already amounts to 131 percent of GDP,
proportionately the highest in the euro zone after Greece's,
rejecting Rome's argument that the expansionary package can
lower debt by boosting economic growth.
    The budget marks ""a change of gear for Italy"", Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday, adding that he was
confident the EU would soften its stance after the government
has had the chance to explain its growth strategy properly.
    Italy must send its planned fiscal framework - a separate
document from the actual budget law - to Brussels on Monday, and
the Commission can reject it and ask for changes, setting off a
possible process of negotiations. 
    Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said last week the deficit
would rise by 22 billion euros ($25.5 billion) next year, with
37 billion euros in spending projects and tax cuts partly offset
by 15 billion of extra revenues and spending cuts in other
areas.
    Ministers have said about 10 billion euros will be devoted
to 5-Star's flagship policy of a basic income for the poor,
while around 8 billion will finance a lowering of the retirement
age. Less than a billion will go to fund tax cuts for the
self-employed, a project championed in particular by the League.
    After the cabinet approves the budget it will pass to
parliament, where it must be passed before the end of the year.
    Despite international criticism and a sell-off of Italy's
government bonds, the budget is popular with Italians. A survey
by pollster Demopolis on Friday showed 52 percent backed the
plan, compared with 38 percent who gave it the thumbs down.
    The spread of Italy's 10-year bond yield over Germany was at
around 306 bps, above the 300 basis point threshold the
government would likely move to soothe markets.

    COLOGNE, Germany, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A suspected
hostage-taking prompted the evacuation of a train station in the
western German city of Cologne on Monday, but police said they
could not confirm reports that shots had been fired.
    ""We assume that a hostage has been taken, either at
McDonald's or at a nearby pharmacy,"" a police spokeswoman said.
""A woman is probably being held but we don't have any further
details.""
    German magazine Focus had earlier reported that several
shots appeared to have been fired at Cologne's main train
station, which is next to the city's landmark cathedral, a major
tourist attraction.
    ""We currently cannot confirm there have been shots or
deaths,"" Cologne police said on Twitter.
    Germany is on high alert for militant attacks, almost two
years after a Tunisian Islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a
Christmas market in central Berlin, killing 11 people as well as
the driver.
    A police spokesman told German broadcaster n-tv that police
were in contact with the hostage-taker, who was inside a
pharmacy at the train station, but said it was unclear whether
he was armed and what his motives were.
    German state-owned rail operator Deutsche Bahn warned that
rail traffic was being delayed by the closure of the station. 
    Images taken outside the station showed the steps of
Cologne's cathedral were crowded with travellers carrying
suitcases.

11 hijackers is being moved from a German prison in preparation
for deportation after serving most of a 15-year jail term for
helping organise the 2011 attacks on U.S. targets, authorities
said on Monday. 
    Mounir El Motassadeq was a member of a group of radical
Islamists based in the northern German port city of Hamburg who
helped bring about the suicide attacks with hijacked airliners
that killed nearly 3,000 people. 
    Handed the maximum sentence of 15 years in 2007 for being an
accessory to mass murder, Motassadeq is one of only two men
convicted to date of involvement in the plot.
    ""Everything is going according to plan,"" said a spokesman
for the state of Hamburg's interior ministry, declining to give
details, other than to say that Motassadeq's release was
permissible from Oct. 15 if he was deported immediately. 
    Photographs showed a man with covered eyes being led by two
armed policemen to a helicopter. German media reported that he
would be taken to Frankfurt to be deported to Morocco, where his
family lives.
    The spokesman in Hamburg could not say exactly when his
sentence was due to end. German media have reported he was due
to stay behind bars until November or early next year.
    At his 2007 trial, his lawyers argued that Motassadeq knew
nothing about the Sept. 11 plot. But prosecutors said he played
a central role in suicide hijacker Mohammed Atta's group by
running the financial affairs of some cell members. 
    Authorities in Hamburg said they would confirm the
deportation once it has taken place.

 (Updates prices)
    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Portuguese and Italian government
bond yields fell on Monday, outperforming euro zone peers after
Moody's ratings agency upgraded Portugal by one notch, back to
investment grade, and Italy's budget plans came back into focus.
    Moody's is the last of the big three agencies to lift
Portugal from the junk status acquired during the euro zone debt
crisis.
    It upgraded Portugal to Baa3 from Ba1 after the close of
European markets on Friday, citing economic and fiscal
improvements. [nL8N1WS4W6]
    The move is unlikely to unlock major flows of capital as
Portugal is already part of the largest investment grade
indexes, but DZ Bank rates strategist Christian Lenk said:
    ""The upgrade is still a positive point. Even though it is
not surprising, it may make investors have a second look at
Portuguese government bonds.""
    Ten-year bond yields dipped briefly below 2 percent before
pulling back to slightly over, down two bps on the day.
<PT10YT=RR>
    Italy's 10-year bond yield <IT10YT=RR>was also down two bps
on the day at 3.56 percent after the cabinet delayed approval of
Italy's 2019 budget by one day to Tuesday.
    Despite apparent broad agreement, government sources said
there were tensions between the ruling parties over plans for a
partial tax amnesty. [nR1N1VZ00W]
    ""I don't think the numbers are credible and the targets
won't be met, but the biggest sell-off in Italy is behind us,""
said Nordea Chief Analyst Jan von Gerich. 
    In contrast to Portugal and Italy, Spain's 10-year bond
yield hit fresh one-year highs at 1.706 percent <ES10YT=RR>,
though it was set to close only marginally higher at 1.69
percent. 
    Spain's Socialists, who hold a minority in parliament,
reached a budget deal on Thursday with anti-austerity party
Podemos that includes tax hikes and raising the minimum wage.
[nL8N1WR24E]
    ""We have started to see many accounts worrying about the
fiscal situation of Spain. We have been answering many questions
over this weekend, many investors are asking about the
implications of the new agreement between Podemos and the
Socialists,"" said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche. 
    Elsewhere, yields on higher-rated euro zone bonds dipped as
investors moved into less risky assets as U.S.-Saudi tensions
and Brexit talks dragged on.
    A weekend election in the German state of Bavaria that
delivered humiliating results for the parties in Chancellor
Angela Merkel's coalition government may also have helped lift
appetite for safe-haven bonds. [nL8N1WV1BT]
    Germany's 10-year bond yield dipped to 0.478 percent
<DE10YT=RR>, its lowest in almost two weeks, before settling at
0.50 percent towards the close.

    Germany is on high alert for militant attacks, almost two
years after a Tunisian Islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a
Christmas market in central Berlin, killing 11 people as well as
the driver.
    ""The suspect is under control,"" police in the western city
of Cologne said on Twitter. ""A female hostage has sustained
light injuries and is being tended to."" The suspect was being
resuscitated.
    A spokeswoman said officers had forced their way into a
pharmacy where the suspect was, adding that the hostage-taker's
motives were unclear.
    The suspect is probably a 55-year-old Syrian citizen,
Cologne's deputy police chief Miriam Brauns said, adding that
police found identification documents in the back of the
pharmacy that showed that the owner of the papers was allowed to
stay in Germany until mid-2021.
    The man was known to police for offences including theft and
fraud, she said, adding that it was not certain that the owner
of the documents was the hostage taker.
    The incident prompted the evacuation of the station.
    ""We also do not rule out a terrorist attack,"" Brauns said.
    Police called on witnesses to provide any pictures or video
footage that could help to determine the suspect's motive.
    German magazine Focus had earlier reported that several
shots appeared to have been fired in the station, which is next
to the city's cathedral, a major tourist attraction.
    Images taken outside the station showed the steps of the 
cathedral were crowded with travellers carrying suitcases due to
the evacuation.
    German police have also arrested eight men suspected of
membership of a far-right militant group which assaulted
foreigners in the eastern city of Chemnitz and planned attacks
on politicians. [nL8N1WI5SQ]

 (Updates death toll)
    By Jean-Paul PELISSIER
    VILLEGAILHENC, France, Oct 15 (Reuters) - At least 12 people
died in southwestern France on Monday when some of the worst
flash floods in a century turned rivers into raging torrents
that engulfed homes and swept away cars.
    Up to seven months' rain fell in just a few hours overnight,
local officials said, catching sleeping residents by surprise
and isolating villages. 
    Several deaths were in the town of Trebes, which sits
between a canal and two rivers, including the Aude.
    As the death toll rose and the extent of the damage became
clear, President Emmanuel Macron decided to hold off on an
already-delayed reshuffle of his cabinet. [nL8N1WV4MO]
    ""It's like a war zone. The village is more or less cut off
from the outside world,"" said Jean-Jacques Garros, a resident of
Villegailhenc, one of the hardest hit areas.
    The Interior Ministry initially put the number of deaths at
13 before revising the toll downwards.
    Prime Minister Edouard Philippe flew to the disaster zone to
meet with emergency service personnel. Some 350 firefighters
were involved in rescue operations, a number which will double
as more are drafted in to deal with the aftermath.     
    Television pictures showed churning, muddy rivers that had
uprooted trees, knocked over concrete power pylons and tore up
roads in the southern region of Aude, near the medieval hilltop
city of Carcassonne.
    Nine helicopters were scrambled to rescue people from the
roofs of their homes as rough weather complicated operations
earlier in the day. Thousands of people have been evacuated from
the area.       
    Among the worst hit were the villages of Conques-sur-Orbiel,
Villegailhenc and Villardonnel, where the water rose as high as
the first-floor windows of some houses. The Aude region is a
popular tourist destination with old towns and villages in its
hilly peaks and land stretching down to the Mediterranean.
    The flash floods struck without warning. At least one victim
was carried away by raging waters while sleeping, according to
Alain Thirion, the prefect of Aude. 
    Schools were shut and residents told to stay at home.
    The Vigicrues agency, which tracks water levels in France,
said the flooding was nearing a peak last seen in 1891.
    Torrential downpours are not uncommon in France at this time
of year, but meteorologists have said that exceptionally warm
sea water along the Mediterranean coast may have intensified the
rains. 
    The year so far is France's warmest since 1900, according to
the state meteorological service.

signed off on an expansionary 2019 budget, boosting welfare
spending, cutting the retirement age and hiking the deficit to
set up a showdown with authorities in Brussels over compliance
with EU rules. [nL8N1WV1L6]
    Following are some of the budget's key measures as explained
by ministers and government officials. The package now passes to
parliament where it must be approved by the end of the year.
    
    * EARLIER RETIREMENT
    The budget rolls back a 2011 pension reform which raised the
retirement age for many Italians to around 67, with further
increases scheduled to match rising life expectancy. The new
system, which begins in February, allows people to retire when
the sum of their age and years of work add up to 100. Hence
someone who has worked for 38 years will be able to retire at
62. 
    The change will cost the state some 7 billion euros ($8.11
billion) in 2019.
    
    * BASIC INCOME
    Poor unemployed Italians and pensioners will be able to draw
a maximum of 780 euros per month to get them out of poverty.
That figure marks the ceiling for single people with no other
income, while those living in a family will receive less. The
benefit is dependent on people doing community work and looking
for regular employment, and is withdrawn if the recipient
declines three job offers that match his qualifications. It will
launch by March and will cost some 10 billion euros next year.
    
    * TAX AMNESTIES 
    The budget offers several schemes to allow people to settle
tax disputes with the authorities by paying a limited sum. The
amnesties are targeted to raise about 8 billion euros next year.
    The main scheme involves people who have failed to declare
up to 100,000 euros of earnings during the last five years, on
which they will be able to pay a rate of 20 percent. 
    Those owing up to 1,000 euros due to fines or unpaid taxes
stemming from before 2010 are ""pardoned"" with no penalties.
    
    * TAX CUT FOR SELF-EMPLOYED
    For the self-employed, the earnings threshold for the
current bottom income tax rate of 15 percent is raised to 65,000
euros per year from 30,000 euros. The right-wing League, which
champions the change, says it will affect around 500,000 people.
    
    * CUT TO BANKS' TAX BENEFITS
    The budget reduces to 86 percent the proportion of interest
payments that banks can deduct from their taxable income,
instead of 100 percent as is currently the case.
    
    * CUT TO ""GOLDEN PENSIONS""
    Pensions above a net 4,500 euros per month which are not
funded by contributions paid into the system will be cut to
below the 4,500 euro threshold.

increases and promotions to many. Public pensions will also rise

    LISBON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Portugal's Socialist government
promised on Tuesday in its 2019 election-year budget to deliver
the lowest deficit in democratic history while giving civil
servants higher pay and helping families with transport costs.
    In the draft budget the government said it would cut the
budget deficit to 0.2 percent of gross domestic product from
this year's projected 0.7 percent, and reach economic growth of
2.2 percent, just a touch lower than this year.
    The draft forecast unemployment of 6.3 percent next year,
down from 6.9 percent in 2018.
    ""This is a good budget to follow the route we have been on
so far, of more growth, more jobs and more equality,"" Prime
Minister Antonio Costa said in a tweet.
    Portugal's economy has rebounded strongly from a 2011-14
debt crisis under the ruling Socialists in the past three years,
helped by strong exports, rising foreign investment, booming
tourism and housing.
    While keeping the deficit on a downward path, the budget
proposes to subsidise families' transport costs in the Lisbon
and Porto metropolitan regions, where nearly half of Portugal's
population lives. The subsidy will cap two family members'
monthly public transport passes at 40 euros and make all
subsequent ones free.
    The blueprint also unfreezes civil servants' career
progression for the first time since 2009, delivering salary
increases and promotions to many. Public pensions will also rise
by more than inflation in 2019.
    Portugal's debt-to-GDP ratio should fall to 118.5 percent
next year from 121.2 percent in 2018, the document showed.
    Finance Minister Mario Centeno presented the draft budget to
parliament just before midnight. He will hold a news conference
early Tuesday to provide more details on the blueprint.

    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - British housing minister James
Brokenshire called on his government colleagues to rally behind
Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan before a meeting of her
top ministerial team on Tuesday to discuss her proposals for a
deal.
    On Monday, May urged the European Union not to allow a
disagreement over how to ensure there was no return of a hard
border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland derail
talks which stalled at the weekend. [nL8N1WV31L]
    ""The message is we need to support the prime minister in
making further progress this week ... and therefore move to that
position of getting that positive outcome for our country,""
Brokenshire told BBC radio. 
    ""Whilst making sure that it is our entire United Kingdom
that leaves the European Union, the single market and the
customs union because it is our UK that is just so important.""
    May said on Monday she believed a Brexit agreement was still
achievable although European Council President Donald Tusk
warned that the chances of a no-deal divorce had increased. May
is to address her 27 EU peers on Brexit at a summit in Brussels
on Wednesday.
    The British prime minister is battling to not only satisfy
EU demands, but also keep on board eurosceptics in her
Conservative Party who have been vocal critics of her plan, and
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) on whose
support she relies on in parliament.
    The BBC reported that eight senior ministers had met on
Monday evening to discuss the issue and had expressed concern
that any 'backstop plan' to avoid a hard border after Britain
leaves the bloc next March should be time-limited. The EU has
refused to set an end date.

    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - German investor morale darkened
more than expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as
concerns about an escalating trade dispute between the United
States and China and fears of a ""hard Brexit"" clouded the
outlook for Europe's largest economy.
    The ZEW research institute's monthly survey showed economic
sentiment among investors deteriorated to -24.7 from -10.6 in
September. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for
a reading of -12.0.
    ""Expectations for the German economy are dampening above all
due to the intensifying trade dispute between the USA and
China,"" ZEW researcher Wambach said.
    ""A further negative influence on economic and export
expectations is the danger of a 'hard Brexit', which is becoming
ever more likely.""
    The United States and China are locked in a bruising

    A senior EU official said on Tuesday that British Prime
Minister Theresa May's speech to parliament on Monday showed
reaching a deal on the country's exit from the European Union
will be even harder than expected. [nL8N1WW2GA]
    A separate ZEW gauge measuring investors' assessment of the
economy's conditions fell to 70.1 from 76.0 in the previous
month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for 74.5.
    Wambach pointed to political uncertainty at home as another
factor behind the growing pessimism among German investors.
    ""The situation of the governing coalition in Berlin is
perceived to have become more unstable, which also weighs on
economic sentiment,"" he said.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Monday to restore
trust in her government after the Bavarian sister party of her
conservatives suffered heavy losses in a regional election.  
[nL8N1WV211]
    The German economy is expected to have shifted into a lower
gear over the summer months, but the economy ministry said on
Monday that growth should pick up again in the fourth quarter.

    With European Union countries, Italy registered an August trade surplus of 817 million euros, compared with a surplus of 233 million euros in August 2017, national statistics bureau ISTAT said.
   Exports to EU nations in August were up 5.7 percent
year-on-year, compared to an increase of 2.0 percent in imports.

    ROME, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European Union sanctions against
Russia are damaging Italian businesses, Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte said on Tuesday, underscoring growing unhappiness in Rome
over the long-running curbs on Moscow.
    EU leaders imposed sanctions in 2014 to penalise Russia for
annexing Crimea from Ukraine and backing rebels fighting
government troops in the east of Ukraine.
    The curbs on doing business with Russian banking, financial
and energy sectors were renewed in June but expire at the end of
January and are up for discussion in Brussels.
    Italy has not yet confirmed that it will agree to extending
them.
    ""Sanctions, for their own sake, only damage our companies,
which we intend to protect, as well as Russia's civil society,""
Conte said, addressing parliament ahead of an EU summit in
Brussels on Thursday.
    His comments came a day after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo
Salvini had described the EU sanctions as a ""social, cultural
and economic absurdity"". [nR1N1VZ020]
    Conte said the EU meeting would provide an opportunity to
discuss ""how to correctly pursue what I define as a double-track
approach: determination coupled with dialogue"".  
    Conte is scheduled to meet Russia President Vladimir Putin
next week in Moscow. Salvini is due to lead a delegation of
Italian entrepreneurs later this week to a conference in Moscow
organised by the Russian Industrialist Union.

    * Would scrap state subsidies for such savings in future
    * Aims to channel state funds to other housing programmes
    * Lawmaker says companies earned ""extra profits"" on the
scheme

 (Adds comments from OTP chief, analyst, context)
    BUDAPEST, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's government plans to
end state subsidies for home savings bank deposits, saying that
the scheme was too costly,  inefficient and had failed to
encourage the construction of new houses.
    The measure, to be debated in parliament on Tuesday, could
affect banks that sell subsidised savings products in Hungary,
including Budapest-based lender OTP Bank <OTPB.BU>, and
Fundamenta, majority-owned by Germany's Bausparkasse Schwäbisch
Hall.
    After taking power in 2010, Orban imposed hefty taxes on
banks to shore up state finances and introduced measures to help
borrowers at the expense of lenders. But in a landmark 2015
agreement, he agreed to cut the bank tax and refrain from
further unilateral measures that could damage banks' profits.
    Scrapping the subsidy from the home savings product is
unlikely to make a big dent in earnings for the majority of
lenders, but it could impact Fundamenta, Hungary's biggest home
savings bank.
    Fundamenta is yet to make a profit on the capital it
invested, its chief executive Bernadett Tatrai told news website
portfolio.hu, adding that the company remains committed to the
market.
    ""Scrapping the state subsidy creates market constraints, but
that is not necessarily negative as it forces everyone to
reconsider (strategies),"" she told a conference.
    OTP made 2.4 billion forints on the product last year, less
than 1 percent of its overall profit. [nL8N1QK0II]
    ""If the state subsidy thus saved is used to expand other
home subsidy schemes, then this causes us no problems,"" OTP
chief Sandor Csanyi told a press conference. ""I don't think this
will affect the bank's profits significantly.""
    Austria's Erste Bank <ERST.VI> and Dutch lender Aegon
<AEGN.AS>, have made losses on the products for several years,
according to company records. Aegon said it had stopped selling
them.
    
    CONSERVATIVE HUNGARIANS
    The fast-track measure comes amid a general improvement in
Hungary's economy and a boom in lending, which has bolstered
banking profits.
    ""Erste and Aegon probably don't mind much,"" Concorde
Securities analyst Gellert Gaal said. ""Fundamenta lost the most,
while OTP doesn't even notice.""
    He added that Hungarians tend to invest conservatively, so
home savings customers will probably turn to government bonds.
    The bill, which if passed will end subsidies immediately,
caught the market by surprise.
    ""This form of savings does not effectively support home
creation objectives, while service providers are realising extra
profits on part of the state subsidies,"" ruling Fidesz party
lawmaker Erik Banki said in the bill.
    Banki said the main lenders have made profits of almost 60
billion forints ($215.52 million) on the scheme since Orban's
government took power in 2010. He said the scheme would cost the
country more than 70 billion forints this year.
    Hungarian real estate broker Duna House Holding <DUNA.BU>
said that scrapping the subsidy may cut the volumes of the
scheme to zero and could hurt its results in the short term.
    OTP shares were up 0.8 percent at 1128 GMT while Duna House
added 4 pct after a steep fall on Monday.
($1 = 278.4 forints)

servants higher pay, helping families with transport costs and
investing more in healthcare.

country said it would cut the deficit to 0.2 percent of gross
domestic product from this year's projected 0.7 percent, and
reach economic growth of 2.2 percent, just a touch lower than
this year.
    Finance Minister Mario Centeno said public investment will
increase by over 16 percent to over 4.1 billion euros ($4.7
billion), encompassing spending on dozens of new medical centres
across the country and also on new railway lines.
    The average wage in the public sector will rise by over
three percent, with total spending of 850 million euros.
    ""This is the largest public sector salary rise in the past
decade,"" Centeno said, while calling the draft budget ""a
historical mark for the Portuguese economy with the budget in a
situation close to an equilibrium"", a further reduction in
government debt and lower unemployment.
    Asked whether the spending could be viewed as designed to
help the government's reelection in a year's time, Centeno
replied: ""I'll leave this to commentators ... (but) some of them
have an attention deficit.""
    Prime Minister Antonio Costa has earlier this month rejected
 suggestions that the government was preparing an electioneering
budget, citing the envisaged sharp deficit cut.
    The additional spending should however allay some of the
concerns voiced by the minority government's hard-left allies in
parliament who have argued that the government is too focused on
deficit cuts to the detriment of public investment.
    The Socialists lead in opinion polls by a wide margin for a
national election next year, although the surveys show they are
just short of a parliamentary majority which means they will
probably have to maintain an alliance on the left.
    Parliament is due to vote on the budget in a first reading
on Oct. 30 and analysts expect few problems with its passage.
    The draft forecast unemployment of 6.3 percent next year,
down from 6.9 percent in 2018.
    Portugal's economy has rebounded strongly from a 2011-14
debt crisis under the ruling Socialists in the past three years,
helped by strong exports, rising foreign investment, booming
tourism and housing.
    While keeping the deficit on a downward path, the budget
proposes to subsidise families' transport costs in the Lisbon
and Porto metropolitan regions, where nearly half of Portugal's
population lives. The subsidy will cap two family members'
monthly public transport passes at 40 euros and make all
subsequent ones free.
    The blueprint also unfreezes civil servants' career
progression for the first time since 2009, delivering salary
increases and promotions to many. Public pensions will also rise
by more than inflation in 2019.
    Portugal's debt-to-GDP ratio should fall to 118.5 percent
next year from 121.2 percent in 2018, the document showed.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
dropped across the board on Tuesday, narrowing the spread over
German peers, after comments from Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
defending the 2019 budget boosted hopes he would stay on in the
turbulent government.
    The expansionary budget, which was officially signed off on
Monday, sets up a showdown with Brussels as it accommodates the
big spending and tax cutting ambitions of the coalition
partners.
    However, a lot of investors' concerns over the sharply
higher deficit were already priced in, so they focused instead
on the comments from Tria, an economics professor who is
unaffiliated to either ruling party.
    Tria said he was confident he could explain to the European
Commission that Italy needed to raise spending to offset a
slowing economy, and described the 2.4 percent deficit target as
""normal"". [nL8N1WV1L6] Investors see Tria as a moderating
influence in the government.
    Italian yields were down by up to 16 basis points, with
two-year yields 15 bps lower to a one-week low of 1.61 percent
and 10-year yields down 11 bps at 3.45 percent. <IT2YT=RR>
<IT10YT=RR> 
    The Italy/Germany 10-year yield spread tightened around 9
basis points to 293 bps, moving further away from a five-year
peak of around 315 bps hit last week.  <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>
    Italian stocks also performed well on Tuesday with the FTSE
MIB up one percent <.FTMIB.>.
    Alessandro Balsotti, fund manager at JCI Capital, said some
of the positive sentiment comes from the fact that the different
factions within the government were able to compromise and agree
on the budget.
    ""Pending more details and reactions from Europe, the market
may take the coalition's ability to reach a compromise as
positive,"" he said. 
    But Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at
Jefferies in London, warned that the ""relative calm"" seen in the
market could be short lived with credit ratings reviews and
third quarter GDP data due at the end of the month. 
    ""They have managed to get through to the stage where they
have agreed on the proposals and so the budget now goes to
Brussels and it will most likely be rejected, but it's not in
the EU’s interests to pick a fight with Italy,"" he said.     
    Analysts attributed the drop in Italian yields partly to
more attractive valuations, and partly to a general improvement
in risk sentiment, with world markets calming a touch after the
wild swings of last week. 
    Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields were also lower
on the day, with Portugal six basis points lower at 1.95 percent
and Spain down two bps to 1.67 percent. <PT10YT=RR> <ES10YT=RR> 
   
    High-grade euro zone government bond yields were also a
touch lower, having dropped sharply over the past week on a bid
for safe assets. 
    Germany's 10-year yield was largely unmoved after monthly
data showed economic sentiment among investors deteriorated in
October. [nEONIAC0S8]
    The euro zone benchmark was steady at 0.50 percent, hovering
above two-week lows of 0.478 percent hit on Monday. <DE10YT=RR> 
    Elsewhere Finland raised 1 billion euros with a tap of its
existing government bonds maturing 2028 [nL8N1WW325].

 (Updates with law passed)
    By Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai
    BUDAPEST, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's government will end
state subsidies for home savings bank deposits, saying the
scheme is too costly, inefficient and had failed to encourage
the construction of new houses.
    The measure, approved in parliament on Tuesday, could affect
banks that sell subsidised savings products, including
Budapest-based lender OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> and Fundamenta,
majority-owned by Germany's Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall.
    After taking power in 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orban
imposed hefty taxes on banks to shore up state finances and
introduced measures to help borrowers at the expense of lenders.
But in a 2015 deal, he agreed to cut the bank tax and avoid
further unilateral steps that could damage banks' profits.
    Scrapping the subsidy for home savings products is unlikely
to make a big dent in earnings for the majority of lenders, but
could hurt Fundamenta, Hungary's biggest home savings bank.
    A Reuters photographer saw about 20 clients waiting at a
busy Fundamenta branch in Budapest to sign up for last-minute
savings contracts before the subsidy is scrapped.
    Fundamenta has yet to make a profit on the capital it
invested in the product, CEO Bernadett Tatrai told news website
portfolio.hu, and the company remained committed to the market.
    ""Scrapping the state subsidy creates market constraints, but
that is not necessarily negative as it forces everyone to
reconsider (strategies),"" she told a conference.
    OTP made 2.4 billion forints ($8.64 million) on the product
last year, less than 1 percent of its overall profit.
[nL8N1QK0II]
    ""If the state subsidy thus saved is used to expand other
home subsidy schemes, then this causes us no problems,"" OTP
chief Sandor Csanyi told reporters. ""I don't think this will
affect the bank's profits significantly.""
    Austria's Erste Bank <ERST.VI> and Dutch lender Aegon
<AEGN.AS> have incurred losses on the products for several
years, according to company records. Aegon said it had stopped
selling them.
    
    CONSERVATIVE HUNGARIANS
    The fast-track measure approved on Tuesday coincides with a
general improvement in the Hungarian economy and a boom in
lending, which has bolstered banking profits.
    ""Erste and Aegon probably don't mind much,"" Concorde
Securities analyst Gellert Gaal said. ""Fundamenta lost the most,
while OTP doesn't even notice.""
    He added that Hungarians tend to invest conservatively, so
home savings customers will probably turn to government bonds.
    The legislation caught the market by surprise.
    ""This form of savings does not effectively support home
creation objectives, while service providers are realising extra
profits on part of the state subsidies,"" lawmaker Erik Banki of
the ruling Fidesz party said regarding the bill.
    Banki said the main lenders have made profits of almost 60
billion forints ($215.52 million) on the scheme since Orban's
government took power in 2010. He said the scheme would cost the
country more than 70 billion forints this year.
    Hungarian real estate broker Duna House Holding <DUNA.BU>
said that scrapping the subsidy might cut volumes of the scheme
to zero and could hurt its results in the short term.
    OTP shares were up 0.9 percent at 1114 GMT, while Duna House
added 5 pct, reversing a steep fall in early trade.

    By Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
leading critic in her coalition government said on Tuesday he
wanted the ruling alliance to work, batting away calls for his
own resignation after a dismal result for his party in Bavaria's
regional election.
    Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social
Union (CSU), has been a thorn in Merkel's side since 2015, with
criticism of her decision to open German borders to almost
onemillion refugees, most of them fleeing war in the Middle
East.
    But the CSU's disastrous performance on Sunday - its weakest
since 1950 - has raised questions about whether he should stand
down as party leader and interior minister in the national
government.
    The calls grew louder on Tuesday, with a senior member of
the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in
Merkel's coalition, calling Seehofer ""miscast"" as interior
minister and a senior CSU figure suggesting he should step down.
    Seehofer dismissed the idea of resigning, telling a news
conference his work in politics ""is fun"". He said the CSU,
sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), would
act as a stable force in her ruling 'grand' coalition.
    ""I have no inclination at all for minority governments, or
fresh elections and everything that can come with them,"" he
added.
    ""This grand coalition must simply get on with reputable work
and communicate it properly.In the CSU, we will do everything
for the grand coalition to stay,"" Seehofer said.

 (Adds May's spokesman, Barnier, Tusk)
    By Elizabeth Piper and Gabriela Baczynska
    LONDON/LUXEMBOURG, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Britain's Prime
Minister Theresa May told her ministers on Tuesday they would
secure a Brexit deal if they stood together, calling for a show
of unity to silence those pressing her to rethink her strategy
for leaving the European Union.
    A day before heading to Brussels for a summit, May is keen
to show she has the support of her cabinet after facing pressure
from some members of her Conservative Party and the EU to change
course on Brexit, Britain's biggest policy shift in more than 40
years.
    With less than six months before Britain leaves the EU,
Brexit talks have reached a stalemate over the so-called Irish
backstop, a fallback plan to ensure there is no return to a hard
border between Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
    The impasse has increased the possibility of Britain leaving
the bloc without an agreement, a 'no deal' Brexit that could
potentially disrupt trade, delay movement of goods and starve
the world’s fifth largest economy of investment.
    May's spokesman said the cabinet had held ""a very detailed
and thorough discussion"" on the border issue, with the team
united in rejecting any deal that would split the United Kingdom
and might ""trap"" Britain in the backstop indefinitely.
    ""The PM said there will no doubt be challenging moments
ahead, that is in the nature of negotiations. She said she is
committed to securing a Brexit that delivers on the referendum
result, safeguards jobs and security, and which preserves our
union,"" her spokesman told reporters.
    Quoting May directly, he said she told her ministers: ""I am
convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand
firm was can achieve this.""
    He said ministers had shared their concerns over the
backstop, playing down a ""pizza summit"" attended by eight of
them late on Monday to discuss Brexit and whether to back the
prime minister's strategy. The meeting had prompted some reports
of possible resignations.
    Asked whether any minister indicated they might be
considering resigning, he replied: ""They did not."" 
    
    TENSIONS
    Both sides say much of the withdrawal agreement, which sets
the divorce terms for Britain's departure, has been agreed, but
there are still outstanding issues, mostly on the backstop.
    The EU has stuck to its position - a backstop to prevent a
return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland
cannot be time-limited and cannot include the whole of the
United Kingdom remaining in the customs union.
    Under pressure from lawmakers in her Conservative Party and
from her parliamentary partners, Northern Ireland's Democratic
Unionist Party, to hold firm, May must try to convince her
critics that she can deliver on the backstop.
    Her spokesman said ministers had discussed one possible way
out of the stand-off - ""a mechanism to clearly define how that
backstop will end"".
    European Council President Donald Tusk said he would ask May
at Wednesday's summit whether she had any new proposals to break
the impasse. ""For a breakthrough to take place besides goodwill
we need new facts,"" he said.
    The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said both sides
would work ""calmly and seriously"" in the coming weeks to try to
reach agreement on the backstop.
    He said the withdrawal agreement with Britain had to be
""orderly for everyone and all the subjects, including Ireland"".

 (Updates pricing, adds detail on Portugal and Spain)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields
dropped across the board on Tuesday, narrowing the spread over
German peers, after comments from Economy Minister Giovanni Tria
defending the 2019 budget boosted hopes he would remain in the
turbulent government.
    The expansionary budget, which was officially approved on
Monday, sets up a showdown with Brussels because the plan
accommodates the big spending and tax cutting ambitions of the
coalition partners.
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday he was
proud of the budget, adding that austerity is no longer a path
Italy can follow. [nL8N1WW5I0]
    However, much of the concern over the sharply higher deficit
was already priced in, so investors focused instead on the
comments from Tria, an economics professor who is not affiliated
to either ruling party.
    Tria said he was confident he could explain to the European
Commission that Italy needed to raise spending to offset a
slowing economy and described the 2.4 percent deficit target as
""normal"". Investors see Tria as a moderating influence in the
government.[nL8N1WV1L6] 
    Italian yields fell as much as 18 basis points, with
two-year yields down 18 bps at a one-week low of 1.58 percent
and 10-year yields dropping 11 bps to 3.45 percent. <IT2YT=RR>
<IT10YT=RR> 
    The Italy/Germany 10-year yield spread tightened by about 7
basis points to 295 bps, moving further away from a five-year
peak of around 315 bps hit last week.  <IT10YT=RR> <DE10YT=RR>
    Italian stocks also performed well on Tuesday, with the FTSE
MIB up about 2.2 percent <.FTMIB.>.
    Alessandro Balsotti, fund manager at JCI Capital, said that
some of the positive sentiment comes from the different factions
within the government being able to compromise and agree on the
budget.
    ""Pending more details and reactions from Europe, the market
may take the coalition's ability to reach a compromise as
positive,"" he said. 
    But Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at
Jefferies in London, warned that the ""relative calm"" seen in the
market could be short-lived, with credit rating reviews and
third-quarter GDP data due at the end of the month. 
    ""They have managed to get through to the stage where they
have agreed on the proposals and so the budget now goes to
Brussels, and it will most likely be rejected, but it's not in
the EU’s interests to pick a fight with Italy,"" he said.     
    Analysts attributed the drop in Italian yields partly to
more attractive valuations and partly to a general improvement
in risk sentiment, with world markets calming a touch after the
wild swings of last week. 
    Improved risk appetite also helped to lift peripheral bond
prices. Spanish and Portuguese bond yields -- which move
inversely to price -- were lower on the day after the
presentation of their respective budgets to the EU. 
    Portugal's 10-year government bond yield was down seven
basis points at 1.94 percent and Spain fell by 4 bps to 1.67
percent. <PT10YT=RR> <ES10YT=RR>   
    ""The market has viewed as reasonably positive the budget
deficit plans of Portugal and Spain, though Spain's is somewhat
clouded by ECB comments that its economy may have peaked,"" said
Matt Cairns, rates strategist at Rabobank.
    Spain’s economic recovery may have peaked and downside risks
have materialised, the European Central Bank’s vice-president
said on Monday, hours after the Spanish government cut its
growth forecast for this year and next. [nL8N1WV64V]
    Portugal's credit rating was lifted to investment grade by
ratings agency Moody's on Friday. 
    Germany's 10-year yield was about 2 basis points lower after
monthly data showed economic sentiment among investors has
deteriorated in October. [nEONIAC0S8]
    The euro zone benchmark was steady at 0.49 percent, hovering
above the two-week lows of 0.478 percent hit on Monday.
<DE10YT=RR> 
    Elsewhere, Finland raised 1 billion euros ($1.16 billion)
with a tap of existing government bonds maturing in 2028.

    * Nordea says aware of allegatioms, works closely with
authorities
    * Says it reports all suspicious transactions
    * Allegations made by Hermitage Capital Management

    By Johan Ahlander
    STOCKHOLM, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Sweden's Economic Crime
Authority said on Tuesday it had received documents from
Hermitage Capital Management purporting to show that Nordic bank
Nordea <NDAFI.HE> <NDA.ST> had breached its responsibilities
under anti-money laundering laws.
    ""We have received documents from Hermitage regarding
money-laundering and we're evaluating which authority should
handle this,"" a spokesman for the body told Reuters. 
    He said a formal investigation had not been opened yet.
    Nordea said in an emailed statement to Reuters that it was
aware of the report.
    ""We work closely with the relevant authorities in the
countries in which we operate, including the Nordic Financial
Intelligence Units,"" Nordea said.
    ""In any cases where we deem it to be suspicious
transactions, we report it to the authorities for them to take
forward.""
    It declined to comment on individual clients, citing banking
secrecy rules.
    The Economic Crime Authority declined to give further
details. Hermitage declined to comment.
    In 2015, Nordea was fined 50 million Swedish crowns ($5.62
million) by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for
breaches in anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism
rules. That was the maximum fine at the time.  
    It is the second Nordic bank to be hit by allegations of
breaches in internal controls against money laundering in recent
months.
    Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> has been at the centre of an
investigation into alleged money laundering which has prompted a
U.S. criminal investigation. [nL8N1W51FB][nL8N1WL1G7]
    The Danske scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion)
in transactions processed by Denmark's biggest bank via its
Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank
said last month it thinks are suspicious.
    Bill Browder, the founder and CEO of investment fund
Hermitage Capital Management, filed a criminal complaint with
Danish authorities in July over alleged money laundering at
Danske Bank's Estonian branch in the past. [nL8N1U853V]
[nL5N1UL1ZO]
    The American-born Briton later filed a new criminal
complaint in Estonia concerning Danske Bank.
    Browder, once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia,
is now campaigning to expose corruption.

    MILAN, Oct 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A costly spectrum
auction and woes in Brazil have driven the telco’s stock near
historic lows. Squabbling investors and Italian political
worries are also a concern. But if TIM can contain rival Iliad’s
assault at home, its discount to European peers looks too steep.

    MADRID, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The ageing of Europe's population
could permanently constrain monetary policy, leading to longer
recessions and weaker recoveries, European Central Bank chief
economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday.
    Europe's demographic shift is already lowering interest
rates, leaving the ECB with decreased conventional firepower and
raising the risk that it would more often miss its inflation
objective, Praet said in Madrid.
    The ECB has undershot its target for the past five years and
inflation is not set to hit the bank's objective of almost 2
percent before the end of the decade, suggesting that monetary
policy may have lost some of its potency even as the bank used
unprecedented firepower to stimulate the economy.
    ""We should be wary about permanently placing a large burden
on central banks to deploy tools to counter problems that are
ultimately caused by structural economic and financial
inefficiencies,"" Praet said. 
    While unconventional tools have been effective for now,
Praet argued, the neutral interest rate, often called the
equilibrium rates, has fallen sharply as the population's ageing
has increased savings, lowered productivity growth and lifted
the number of pensioners in relation to active workers. 
    ""Recessions may last longer, and recoveries may be slower
and shallower, with a higher risk throughout of missing the
objective,"" Praet said, referring to the impact of low
equilibrium interest rates on ECB policy.
    Praet added that possible solutions could include raising
the retirement age and policies that encourage labour force
participation, for example through increased labour mobility or
more effective skills training. 
    He also called for policies to revive productivity growth,
particularly in spreading productivity enhancing measures across
borders and to all corners of the currency bloc.

    By Lisa Jucca
    MILAN, Oct 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) -
T elecom Italia <TLIT.MI> is caught in a maelstrom of bad news.
Its two largest shareholders are engaged in a public slanging
match, while nerves about the government’s budget deficit
threaten to push up its borrowing costs. The telco has just
agreed to pay a hefty 2.4 billion euros to secure new mobile
spectrum in Italy, and also faces slower growth and political
uncertainty in its second-biggest market of Brazil. Little
wonder that its shares have fallen close to historic lows. Yet
the selloff may have gone too far.
    The about 30 percent drop in Telecom Italia’s shares this
year makes it look cheap. Including net debt, its enterprise
value is now just over 35 billion euros. Subtract the value
of Telecom Italia’s listed stakes in is Brazilian unit and tower
operator Inwit <INWT.MI> - and their borrowings - and
throw in the 480 million euro down payment for spectrum, and the
figure falls to just over 28.5 billion euros. The domestic
business is expected to produce about 6.5 billion euros of
EBITDA in 2019, after subtracting forecasts for the two listed
affiliates. implying a multiple of 4.4 times. Other European
telcos trade on an average of 5.7 times forecast EBITDA for the
same year, Refinitiv data shows.
    Part of the discount is justified. Telecom Italia’s largest
shareholder, Vivendi <VIV.PA>, has accused rival investor
Elliott Management of spreading rumours to undermine Chief
Executive Amos Genish. The executive, who was appointed by the
French group last year but stayed on after a board overhaul
engineered by Elliott in May, admits the situation on the board
has become problematic. Add poor sentiment towards Italian
companies amid fears the country’s radical government is
undermining the public finances and the picture does not look
pretty.
    But it may be less bleak than it looks. Rival Iliad’s
<ILD.PA> aggressive push into Italy’s mobile phone
market in June seems to have damaged Telecom Italia’s
competitors more than the incumbent. Vodafone <VOD.L> and Wind
have lost a combined 1.7 million contracts to the French player,
Genish said earlier in October, adding his group had barely felt
the impact. Company insiders say Telecom Italia had lost
just 50,000 net subscribers to the upstart by September. The
Italian telco has many headaches, but for now fears that it is
suffering from increased competition at home look overblown.

Interim CEO to remain in post for now
Bank hit by money laundering scandal

 (Adds background)
    By Stine Jacobsen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>,
reeling from a money laundering scandal, suffered another
setback on Wednesday when the Danish financial regulator
rejected its candidate for chief executive on the grounds that
he lacked sufficient experience.
    Denmark's largest bank is looking for a new leader after
Thomas Borgen was ousted last month as the group struggles to
deal with a money laundering scandal.[nL8N1WH15W]
    Danske's board had asked the financial watchdog for its
approval of Jacob Aarup-Andersen, 40. Aarup-Andersen joined
Danske in 2016 from Danica Pension and has held the post of head
of wealth management since May this year.
    While the regulator found he was ""well qualified in many
areas"", it added ""longer experience, including within certain of
Danske Bank's business areas, is needed,"" the bank said.
    ""The Board of Directors unanimously backed Jacob
Aarup-Andersen as new CEO, knowing full well that longer
experience in certain areas would have been desirable,"" said
Chairman Ole Andersen in a statement, adding that the board was
now in dialogue with other potential candidates.
    Jesper Nielsen, who was the head of Danske Bank's domestic
banking business, will stay on as interim CEO.
    Other names mentioned by analysts and media outlets as
possible candidates are the CEO of Danish mortgage lender
Nykredit, Michael Rasmussen, the head of European Fixed Income
and Commodities at Morgan Stanley <MS.N> Jakob Horder, and
Annika Falkengren who is the former CEO of Swedish bank SEB
<SEBa.ST> and a partner in Swiss bank Lombard Odier.  
    Former CEO Borgen quit after an internal inquiry found that
payments totalling 200 billion euros ($231 billion), many of
which Danske Bank said were suspicious, had been moved through
its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Danske Bank shares hit a four-year low this month after the
bank said it faced a U.S. criminal investigation into the case.

    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds were in
demand for a second day running on Wednesday, buoyed by improved
global market sentiment, and one analyst said investors were
taking off heavy short positions. 
    Rome on Monday officially approved its expansion budget, but
markets are relieved that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria remains
in office, prompting a strong run in Italian bonds since.
    Analysts see a good chance the European Commission will
reject Italy's budget, but they said the lack of further shocks
in Monday's proposal had prompted further buying of government
bonds. 
    Italy's two-year government bond yield was down seven basis
points at 1.52 percent, having been as low as 1.477 percent
early in the session, while the 10-year yield slipped four basis
points to 3.42 percent <IT2YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR>.
    The 10-year Italy/Germany bond yield spread held below 300
basis points, a level analysts deem to be a threshold for buying
or selling Italian debt. It was last at 295 bps, having recorded
its biggest one-day fall in nearly two weeks on Tuesday.
    Last week, many appeared to be positioning for worse news on
the budget front, with data suggesting investors were going
heavily short on Italian debt, said UniCredit rates strategist
Luca Cazzulani. 
    Thomson Reuters data shows that open interest in short-dated
BTP futures was at its highest in over a year on Oct. 11, and
remained elevated for the rest of the week. <FBTSc1> 
    ""The fact that you had such high open interest at a time of
dropping bond prices suggests that a lot of shorts were coming
into the market,"" said Cazzulani. ""With the absence of any
negative news this week, some of that will come out."" 
    He said that a general improvement in risk sentiment in
global markets has helped lift Italian bonds as well. 
    ""Just look at what U.S. equities are doing in the last
couple of days, the effect of this (on Italian bonds) should not
be downplayed,"" he said. 
    The S&P 500 index was up over 2 percent overnight <.SPX>.
European stock markets were also up 2 percent on Wednesday on
the back of strong earnings <.STOXX> <MKTS/GLOB>. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday he was
proud of the budget, adding that austerity was no longer a path
Italy could follow [nL8N1WW5I0].
    The relief rally could be short-lived as Italy's credit
rating and the European Commission's response to Italy's budget
proposal come into focus.
    ""If we accepted everything that the Italian government was
proposing, we would see a virulent counter-reaction from other
euro zone countries,"" commission president Jean-Claude Juncker
told reporters in Brussels.
    The commission has two weeks to review Italy's fiscal plans.
It could reject them completely and ask Rome to rewrite them, an
unprecedented step that would formally begin a long dispute
[nL8N1WW5I0].    
    Elsewhere, euro zone bond yields were benefiting from
improved global risk appetite, with Portuguese and Spanish
government bonds extending Tuesday's falls.  
    Germany's government bond yield, the benchmark for the
region, also opened lower, below 0.5 percent, and was last
around 0.478 percent <DE10YT=RR>.

slowing car demand in China and new fuel consumption regulations
were hurting investors' sentiment towards European autos stocks
and warned this results season could be challenging, hitting
shares in the sector on Wednesday.
    Europe's autos sector <.SXAP> is already down 6 percent this
month and is on track for its worst year since 2011 as a global
trade dispute drove investors to dump a sector vulnerable to
higher tariffs threatened by the United States. 
    Goldman Sachs (GS) said weaker Chinese car demand and the
cost of adapting to the European Union's new WLTP (Worldwide
harmonised Light vehicles Test Procedure) fuel consumption
regulation were worrying clients, as well as weak Latin America
production.
    ""Overall we see this as a challenging quarter for the
sector, with potential for downward earnings revisions by
suppliers,"" GS analysts wrote in a note to clients, lowering
their earnings estimates for auto supplier companies by 4
percent on average over 2018-22. 
    The downbeat note had dragged Europe's autos sector <.SXAP>
down 1.4 percent by 0956 GMT, making it the worst-performing
sector.
    France's Peugeot <PEUP.PA> and Renault <RENA.PA> fell 2.9
and 2.7 percent respectively, while German carmakers Daimler
<DAIGn.DE>, BMW <BMWG.DE>, and Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> fell 0.4

money laundering scandal, suffered another setback on Wednesday
when the Danish financial regulator rejected its candidate for
chief executive on the grounds that he lacked sufficient
experience. [nL8N1WX28R]
    Denmark's biggest lender released a report last month
showing its branch in Estonia handled 200 billion euros ($230
billion) in transactions - 10 times Estonia's GDP - between 2007
and 2015.
    It said of the approximately 6,200 accounts it had so far
examined most were linked to clients registered in Russia,
Britain and the British Virgin Islands and ""the vast majority of
these customers have been deemed suspicious"". [nL8N1W51FB]
    The following timeline summarises recent developments:  
    
    Oct 17 - Danske's board had asked the financial watchdog to
approve Jacob Aarup-Andersen, 40, as its next chief executive.
Aarup-Andersen joined Danske in 2016 from Danica Pension and has
held the post of head of wealth management since May this year. 
    While the regulator found he was ""well qualified in many
areas"", it added ""longer experience, including within certain of
Danske Bank's business areas, is needed,"" the bank said. 
    
    Oct 5 - Danske's shares are dragged to a four-year low as it
seeks to reassure investors over the impact of a  U.S. criminal
investigation into its Estonian branch. [nL8N1WL1G7]
        
    Oct 4 - Danske says it has ""received requests for
information from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in
connection with a criminal investigation relating to the bank's
Estonian branch"". [nL8N1WK1GP]
    
    Oct 4 - Danske halts a share buyback programme 3.2 billion
Danish crowns ($493 million) short of its target of 10 billion
after Denmark's Financial Services Authority raised Danske's
capital requirements, citing a rise in its ""compliance and
reputational risks"".
        
    Oct 2 - The European Parliament invites a whistleblower in
the Danske scandal to testify before its special committee on
financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance on Nov. 21.
Danish newspaper Berlingske a week earlier named him as Howard
Wilkinson, Danske's former head of trading in the Baltics.
[nL8N1WI1WO] [nL8N1WC3GO]
        
    Oct 1 - Less than two weeks after saying CEO Thomas Borgen
would stay on until a replacement is found, Danske appoints
Jesper Nielsen, head of its Danish banking business, as interim
chief executive with immediate effect. [nL8N1WH15W]

    Sept 21 - Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) says it is
""aware of the use of UK registered companies in this case and
has related on-going operational activity"". [nL8N1W717P]
    
    Sept 19 - Danske Bank CEO Thomas Borgen resigns pending the
selection of a successor after the bank publishes a report on
suspected money laundering in Estonia. Borgen tells a news
conference: ""Even though I was personally cleared from a legal
point of view, I hold the ultimate responsibility. There is no

    * Spread 140 bps wider this year, biggest widening since
2011

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italy may have to act to contain
a surge in its borrowing costs sooner than comments from the
ruling coalition government suggest.
    The economy minister pledged this month to do whatever was
needed if the 10-year bond yield gap over Germany - effectively
the risk premium on Italian bonds - widened to 400 or 500 basis
points [nS8N1PA07Q]. And with significant risk already priced
in, a further blowout in the spread is unlikely for now.
    But lawmakers' comments suggest the issue remains a
contentious point as Italy draws up its spending plans, given
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's controversial vow to
expand the budget deficit whatever the ""lords of the spread"" -
i.e, bond investors - may think.
    Such remarks underline the importance of the spread and how
wide it would have to get before Rome finds it intolerable.
    The Italy-Germany spread is now around 305 bps, near its
widest in five years. It has swelled 150 bps this year, the most
since 2011, as Rome's budget plans create tension with the
European Union and put Italian credit ratings at risk of
downgrades.
    But some market watchers say that rather than the 400-500
bps spread Italian officials have mentioned, the pain threshold
is closer to 350-360 bps. Those levels - consistent with 10-year
Italian bond yields of around 4 percent - would likely trigger a
sharper rise in borrowing costs and contagion across the bloc,
they say.
    ""At 350-400 bps it becomes very hard for investors to stay
calm on Italian bonds,"" said Michael Leister, head of rates
strategy at Commerzbank. ""It would show there is not a quick
solution to the Italian problem.""
    In short, it's the spread widening impact on banks and
Italy's ability to fund its borrowing that's at stake.
    Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at U.S.-based
broker dealer INTL FCStone, said Italy cannot afford to pay more
than 4 percent on its debt over long periods of time without
falling into a ""public death loop"" where servicing costs make
debt growth faster than economic growth even if Rome keeps a
primary fiscal surplus.
    Given that Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 130 percent,
its debt-servicing costs at a 4 percent interest rate come to
about 5 percent of gross domestic product, he said.
    ""If nominal GDP in Italy grows by 3 percent at best, that
means that the government would need to maintain a primary
surplus of 2 percent just to keep the debt constant,"" Deluard
added.
    The primary budget surplus — the budget balance net of
interest spending — is targeted at 1.8 percent this year, up
from 1.4 percent in 2017 but still short of that 2 percent.
    Citi analysts say 10-year bond yields above 4 percent - 50
bps up from current levels <IT10YT=RR> - could be the ""tipping
point"" for selling to accelerate. Goldman Sachs reckons a
sustained spread move through 300 bps would require action from
Italy or the EU.
    J.P. Morgan adds that higher spreads over time add
cumulatively to the interest expenses and ""eat up fiscal space.""
    ""As a rule of thumb, we consider that 100 bps increase in
the yield curve leads to a roughly 0.15 percent of GDP increase
in interest payments in a given year,"" the bank said in a note.
    So far the economy and public have not felt the full effect
of the spread widening as many household lending benchmarks are
still essentially linked to official ECB interest rates. Italian
mortgages are priced against Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered
Rate) and not Italy's sovereign yield curve.
    Furthermore, Italy has taken advantage of low borrowing
costs in recent years to extend the average remaining maturity
of its debt to around seven years. That means rising yields take
longer to feed into higher debt refinancing costs. [nL5N1SM4LF]
    
    PAIN TRADE
    But the yield spike and wider spreads do increase borrowing
costs at bond auctions. A three-year bond sale last week saw
Italy pay its highest borrowing rate in five years, although the
auction size was small at 3.5 billion euros. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    According to UniCredit, the Italian government has raised
325 billion euros in bills and bonds so far this year at an
average cost of just below 1 percent, mostly to refinance
maturing debt, which carried a cost of 1.3 percent on average.
    But the length of time these elevated costs persist is as
important as the peaks and troughs they may briefly hit, and
problems will mount if yields stay high into next year.
    Rabobank head of rates strategy Richard McGuire says a rise
in the weighted-average yield of Italian bonds is worrying as it
is consistent with a rising path in debt servicing costs.
    He estimates that a yield at a weighted-average maturity of
2.63 percent would keep debt/GDP levels constant. An Italian
bond maturing in June 2025, the closest in duration to the
weighted average maturity, has a yield of 3.06 percent
<IT509031=>.
    A more immediate hit is being felt by banks. Italian lenders
hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds - accounting for
10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by eroding
the value of those holdings, eats into their capital levels.
    Any widening of the spread to 400 bps would force some
lenders to tap investors for cash, the Italian traders'
association Assiom Forex said recently. [nL8N1WH52F]
    Morgan Stanley estimates that the overall impact of spread
widening since the second quarter on Italian banks' capital
levels is between 1 and 14 bps.
    Based on the size of their bond portfolios and the starting
levels of their Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - a core measure of a
bank's financial strength from a regulator standpoint - Banco
BPM, UBI and BMPS are most vulnerable, Morgan Stanley said.
    It's no surprise that a jump in Italian yields is usually
accompanied by a plunge in bank stocks, often spilling into
European markets.
    In that environment, confidence in policymakers' ability to
stop market turmoil turning into a crisis can easily evaporate,
forcing them to act quickly. 
    May offered proof; spreads briefly topped 300 bps on fears
of a snap election that could become a de facto referendum on
euro membership. 5-Star and the League - the parties comprising
Italy's coalition - the quickly moved to form a government.
    An unwinding of ECB stimulus and higher U.S. Treasury yields
also make for a volatile backdrop.
    Contagion into the euro zone has been remarkably subdued
considering Italy is the bloc's third-biggest economy. That too
may change. 
    One channel could be the investment industry, should Italian
bond losses force fund managers to sell Spanish or Portuguese
debt to protect portfolio returns for the year.
    ""Like it or not, the development of the Italy-Germany spread
will decide the performance of most euro bond portfolios this
year, even those not invested in Italy,"" said Commerzbank's
Leister.

    By Stine Jacobsen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>,
reeling from a money laundering scandal, will resume its search
for a new chief executive after a Danish regulator rejected its
internal candidate for the job, and analysts said it would be
forced to look outside the bank.
    Jacob Aarup-Andersen, 40, the Danske board's choice to take
over the helm of Denmark's biggest bank, was rejected by the
country's financial regulator on the grounds that he wasn't
experienced enough.
    The previous CEO, Thomas Borgen, was ousted last month as
the group struggles to deal with a 200 billion euro ($230
billion) money laundering scandal that has prompted several
criminal investigations and spooked investors. [nL8N1WH15W]
    Aarup-Andersen joined Danske from Danica Pension in 2016 as
chief financial officer and has been head of wealth management
since May.
    While the regulator found he was ""well qualified in many
areas"", it added ""longer experience, including within certain of
Danske Bank's business areas, is needed,"" the bank said.
    ""The Board of Directors unanimously backed Jacob
Aarup-Andersen as new CEO, knowing full well that longer
experience in certain areas would have been desirable,"" said
Chairman Ole Andersen in a statement, adding that the board was
now talking to other potential candidates.
    The financial watchdog's unusual move to block the decision
raises the pressure on Danske Bank's board.
    ""This can't be interpreted as anything other than a slap in
the face,"" said Per Hansen, economist at investment firm
Nordnet. However, he did not think the chairman was likely to
step down before a new CEO is found.
    Danske Bank will now have to look for an external candidate,
possibly from outside Denmark, said Sydbank analyst Mikkel Emil
Jensen. ""There are no more internal candidates left,"" he said.
    
    RISK HARD TO MEASURE
    However, the task will be difficult as the full magnitude of
the money laundering scandal and potential fines is yet to be
uncovered.
    ""There is no one who can quantify the risk that Danske Bank
is in and a future CEO won't be able to quantify the
work-related risk either, that is a big challenge,"" said Peter
Lundgreen, CEO of investment advisory firm Lundgreen's Capital. 
  
    Other names mentioned by analysts and media outlets as
possible candidates are the CEO of Danish mortgage lender
Nykredit, Michael Rasmussen; the head of European Fixed Income
and Commodities at Morgan Stanley <MS.N> Jakob Horder; and
Annika Falkengren, who is the former CEO of Swedish bank SEB
<SEBa.ST> and a partner in Swiss bank Lombard Odier.
[nL8N1WA26D]  
    Danske Bank shares hit a four-year low this month after the
bank said it faced a U.S. criminal investigation into a money
laundering scandal at its Estonian branch. The shares are down
more than 40 percent this year. [nL8N1WL1G7] 
    Rating agency Moody's said last week it has downgraded all
of Danske's long-term debt ratings because of the criminal
investigation into the bank by the U.S. Department of Justice.
    It followed similar moves by rating agencies DBRS, S&P and
Fitch.
    Jesper Nielsen, who was the head of Danske Bank's domestic
banking business, will stay on as interim CEO.
    Former CEO Borgen quit after an internal inquiry found that
payments totalling 200 billion euros, many of which Danske Bank
said were suspicious, had been moved through its Estonian branch
between 2007 and 2015. [nL8N1W51FB]
    Shares in Danske were trading down 2.1 percent at 138.7
Danish crowns at 1156 GMT on Wednesday.

    BERLIN, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on
Wednesday there was evidence the Syrian man who took a woman
hostage in Cologne on Monday had a radical Islamist motive.
    The chief federal prosecutor said witnesses reported that
the man, identified only as Mohammad A.R., had said he was a
member of Islamic State and wanted to travel to join the group
in Syria. 
    He had made demands by phone to be allowed to travel to
Islamic State in Syria, the prosecutor said in a statement.
    ""Based on the knowledge we have now, there are sufficient
indications that there was a radical Islamist background to the
act,"" it said.
    Police said on Tuesday the suspect was in a coma after being
shot several times but his life was not in danger. [nL8N1WW5DM]
    The suspect poured a flammable liquid on the floor of a fast
food restaurant and lit it, and a 14-year-old trying to escape
the flames fell and suffered burns, the prosecutor said.
    The suspect is charged with attempted murder and causing
grievous bodily harm.
    Prosecutors said they were investigating whether the suspect
had carried out the attack on behalf of IS or another terrorist
organisation and whether there were accomplices.

    * Outside risks may warrant more gradual tightening
    * Dedek sole voice for stable rates at last meeting
    * Does not say how he will vote at Nov 1 meeting

    By Robert Muller and Jason Hovet
    PRAGUE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Czech National Bank may need
to take a more gradual approach to raising interest rates while
it assesses risks from abroad, and a slower pace would not be
threat to meeting its inflation target, board member Oldrich
Dedek said in an interview.
    Dedek, the lone vote on the seven-member board against
raising rates costs at the last monetary policy meeting, said he
did not see evidence backing arguments that inflationar pressure
in the domestic economy was starting to materialise.
    He told Reuters he agreed with moving ahead with normalising
policy, but he believed there should be debate on the pace.
    ""A somewhat holding tactic ... does not collide with meeting
the inflation target. That is important for me,"" he said on
Wednesday.
    The central bank has raised its key two-week repo rate
<CZCBIR=ECI> at its last three meetings, to 1.50 percent. 
    Since ending a four-year-old intervention regime keeping the
crown weak in 2017, the bank has lifted rates from near zero in
six steps, the most aggressive tightening in the European Union,
as the European Central Bank and others in the region keep loose
policy in place.
    Markets see good chances of another hike this year, although
central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok said the timing of the next
move was uncertain after the last meeting, on Sept. 26. 
    Czech policymakers are contending with a fast-growing
economy, the biggest wage increases in 15 years, the lowest
unemployment in decades, along with home prices rising at one of
the fastest rates in the EU.
    Dedek said global risks, such as trade war escalation and  
uncertainty over Britain's exit from the EU, should be taken
into account, even if they could not be completely factored into
the bank's staff forecasts.
    For example, he said, the rising risk of a hard Brexit could
hurt Germany, which is the main Czech trading partner.
    ""To accelerate the (tightening) pace at the moment when
global risks are growing, that may be a point to discus, that is
why I eventually decided not to support raising rates (at the
last meeting),"" he said.
    
    NO COMMITMENT
    Dedek did not say how he would vote at the bank's next
meeting, on Nov. 1, when new staff forecasts will be presented.
    He said while it was not possible to completely factor in
outside risks to the outlook, ""the minimum could be to accept it
via a bit more gradual approach to normalisation (of policy). To
wait and see how the data will come out, whether the risks are
really materialising.""
    He added: ""But it is not about changing the philosophy of
(our) monetary policy, it really is about the pace, knowing that
a slower one does not threaten meeting the inflation target,
which is the key issue for me.""
    On the crown, Dedek said its weakness has been caused by
foreign risks, even though Czech economic fundamentals showed it
should be strengthening.
    The crown <EURCZK=> traded at around 25.83 to the euro on
Wednesday. Its three-month average is 25.75 versus the
assumption of an average third-quarter rate of 25.8 seen in the
central bank's current outlook, which also sees it strengthening
to 25.3 in the fourth quarter.

    ""If we are asked to confirm (the sanctions), we will say

    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The commissioner for the EU
budget, Guenther Oettinger, on Wednesday denied a media report
saying the EU Commission had already decided to reject Italy's
draft budget for next year.
    ""I did not say there is a Commission decision on Italy,"" he
wrote on Twitter after German magazine Der Spiegel published an
interview with him on its website.
    In the article, Der Spiegel said a letter to Italy on its
budget from EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici should
arrive in Rome on Thursday or Friday, without clarifying the
source of this information.
    ""It is my personal opinion that based on the figures it is v
(very) likely that we have to ask Italy to correct the draft
budget,"" Oettinger said. He added he had not said the Commission
would send a letter to Italy on its budget on Thursday or
Friday.  
   The EU Commission is currently reviewing Italy's draft budget
and can formally raise concerns about it until next Monday. If
it does so, it can then decide to send the budget back to Rome
for changes by Oct. 29, in what would be an unprecedented move
[nL8N1WV23B].
    Italy's draft budget for next year boosts welfare spending,
cuts the retirement age and hikes deficit spending. This could
be in breach of EU fiscal rules that require Rome to lower its
large public debt.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders are
meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss Brexit [nL8N1WX526].
    Below please find their comments upon arriving at the
summit.
    
    PETER PELLEGRINI, PRIME MINISTER OF SLOVAKIA
    ""I'm a very optimistic person but not today.""
    ""I think we will receive an information that there is still
no deal and I think we should do the maximum till the last day
to try to have an agreement.""
    ""But on the other side the other 27 countries, we should be
prepared also for a no-deal result. And I think maybe it will
finish like that.""
    ""My hope was that today we'll have already some concrete
solution on the table, but it looks like it will not be a deal
today."" 
    
    THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
    ""What we've seen is that we've solved most of the issues in
the withdrawal agreement. There is still the question of the
Northern Irish backstop ... by working intensively and closely,
we can achieve that deal. As I say a deal is in the interests
not just of the UK but also the European Union.""  
    ""Now is the time to make it happen."" 
    
    DALIA GRYBAUSKAITE, PRESIDENT OF LITHUANIA
    ""Today there will be no breakthrough.""
    ""We realise that the technical agreement of last week was
not accepted in London.""
    ""It will be November and maybe even more summits because we
are not yet in the final stage (of negotiations).""
    
    XAVIER BETTEL, PRIME MINISTER OF LUXEMBOURG
    ""We just need to finalise something because the 29th of
March will be the last day of the UK in our family. So we need
to find an agreement. And we still need to work also on
no-deal.""
    ""I am able to come back as often as we need to come if it's
to find a solution. But I don't want just to come to have a cup
of coffee... We all have to move together.""
    ""We fully understand that Prime Minister May has a difficult
situation in the UK... We have to move on both sides.""
    ""There is still hope (for a Brexit agreement). But there is
also the possibility of a no-deal. We'll continue to work on a
no-deal too. Even if we have an agreement here it doesn't mean
that Westminster agrees.""
    ""We won't block a longer transition if it's to find a common
solution.""
    ""A divorce is not always good... But the fact is we need to
find an agreement.""
     ""We have a common market and we can't change rules for the
UK.""
    ""I won't be the one who will block a discussion about having
maybe a year more for the backstop.""
    Q: How seriously do you take the prospect of a no deal?
    A: ""Very seriously.""
    ""We can't wait for long to have a solution. We need to hurry
up, they leave in six months.""
    
    JURI RATAS, PRIME MINISTER OF ESTONIA
    ""I regret that we don't have an agreement yet between the UK
and the EU. But I still believe that this agreement is possible
and our goal is to find the solution and to find the way. I
think it's possible.""
    ""It's very important to keep the 27 close. We are united, we
are acting as a team and we understand very well that the main
question is the border question between Northern Ireland and
Ireland.
    ""The UK was and is a close and important partner for us.""

    By Michelle Nichols
    UNITED NATIONS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.N. Syria envoy Staffan
de Mistura said on Wednesday he would step down at the end of
November for family reasons, quitting as the Syrian government -
backed by Iran and Russia - has retaken  most of the country and
a political deal remains elusive. 
    Despite the advances by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, de
Mistura said a political solution was still the key as ""the
alternative will be territorial gains and no sustainable peace.""
    De Mistura is the longest serving of three U.N. mediators
during the more-than-seven-year Syrian conflict. His
predecessors - former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
veteran Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi - both quit in
frustration over a global stalemate on how to end the war.
    However, his successor faces a tough battle to negotiate a
political deal, which the West has said is needed to unlock its
reconstruction support and to encourage the bulk of the millions
of refugees in Europe and the Middle East to return.
    When asked if he was upset at not being able to achieve a
breakthrough, de Mistura - who has been in the job for more than
four years - told reporters: ""One month can be a century in
politics. ... I have always been an optimist.""
    Diplomats said possible replacements for de Mistura included
U.N. Iraq envoy Jan Kubis, former Algerian foreign minister
Ramtane Lamamra, U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov and 
Norway's Ambassador to China Geir Pedersen.     
    During his final weeks in the job, De Mistura told the
Security Council that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had
instructed him to ""verify once and for all"" whether a credible,
balanced constitutional committee could be convened. 
    Participants at a Syrian peace conference in Russia in
January had agreed to form a committee to rewrite the Syrian
constitution that will be made up of 150 people, with a third
chosen by the government, a third by opposition groups and a
third by the United Nations. 
    De Mistura said creation of the panel had been delayed as
""questions continue to be raised, mainly by the Syrian
government, over the composition"" of the U.N. list. He said he
would visit Damascus next week and hoped to win government
approval for a ""credible and inclusive third list.""
    ""If there is a political will, there is no reason for the
constitutional committee not to be convened in November,"" he
told the Security Council.    
    The 15-member U.N. Security Council has long been deadlocked
with Western powers pitted against Syrian ally Russia, backed by
China.  
    French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre accused the Syrian
government of obstruction, ""which ultimately shows us that it
does not want to participate in the diplomatic efforts underway,
while its allies are either unable or unwilling to convince it
to put an end to its intransigence.""
    Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow wanted
the constitutional committee to be formed as soon as possible
but that ""setting artificial deadlines in this case would be
counterproductive."" 
    ""We need to be patient,"" Nebenzia said.

    * 4 pct yield on Italian 10-year bond a key level - analysts
    * 400 bps on BTP/Bund spread may become a limit markets test
    * Spread 140 bps wider this year, biggest widening since
2011

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italy may have to act to contain
a surge in its borrowing costs sooner than comments from the
ruling coalition government suggest.
    The economy minister pledged this month to do whatever was
needed if the 10-year bond yield gap over Germany - effectively
the risk premium on Italian bonds - widened to 400 or 500 basis
points [nS8N1PA07Q]. And with significant risk already priced
in, a further blowout in the spread is unlikely for now.
    But lawmakers' comments suggest the issue remains a
contentious point as Italy draws up its spending plans, given
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's controversial vow to
expand the budget deficit whatever the ""lords of the spread"" -
i.e, bond investors - may think.
    Such remarks underline the importance of the spread and how
wide it would have to get before Rome finds it intolerable.
    The Italy-Germany spread is now around 305 bps, near its
widest in five years. It has swelled 150 bps this year, the most
since 2011, as Rome's budget plans create tension with the
European Union and put Italian credit ratings at risk of
downgrades.
    But some market watchers say that rather than the 400-500
bps spread Italian officials have mentioned, the pain threshold
is closer to 350-360 bps. Those levels - consistent with 10-year
Italian bond yields of around 4 percent - would likely trigger a
sharper rise in borrowing costs and contagion across the bloc,
they say.
    ""At 350-400 bps it becomes very hard for investors to stay
calm on Italian bonds,"" said Michael Leister, head of rates
strategy at Commerzbank. ""It would show there is not a quick
solution to the Italian problem.""
    In short, it's the spread widening impact on banks and
Italy's ability to fund its borrowing that's at stake.
    Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at U.S.-based
broker dealer INTL FCStone, said Italy cannot afford to pay more
than 4 percent on its debt over long periods of time without
falling into a ""public death loop"" where servicing costs make
debt growth faster than economic growth even if Rome keeps a
primary fiscal surplus.
    Given that Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 130 percent,
its debt-servicing costs at a 4 percent interest rate come to
about 5 percent of gross domestic product, he said.
    ""If nominal GDP in Italy grows by 3 percent at best, that
means that the government would need to maintain a primary
surplus of 2 percent just to keep the debt constant,"" Deluard
added.
    The primary budget surplus — the budget balance net of
interest spending — is targeted at 1.8 percent this year, up
from 1.4 percent in 2017 but still short of that 2 percent.
    Citi analysts say 10-year bond yields above 4 percent - 50
bps up from current levels <IT10YT=RR> - could be the ""tipping
point"" for selling to accelerate. Goldman Sachs reckons a
sustained spread move through 300 bps would require action from
Italy or the EU.
    J.P. Morgan adds that higher spreads over time add
cumulatively to the interest expenses and ""eat up fiscal space.""
    ""As a rule of thumb, we consider that 100 bps increase in
the yield curve leads to a roughly 0.15 percent of GDP increase
in interest payments in a given year,"" the bank said in a note.
    So far the economy and public have not felt the full effect
of the spread widening as many household lending benchmarks are
still essentially linked to official ECB interest rates. Italian
mortgages are priced against Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered
Rate) and not Italy's sovereign yield curve.
    Furthermore, Italy has taken advantage of low borrowing
costs in recent years to extend the average remaining maturity
of its debt to around seven years. That means rising yields take
longer to feed into higher debt refinancing costs. [nL5N1SM4LF]
    
    PAIN TRADE
    But the yield spike and wider spreads do increase borrowing
costs at bond auctions. A three-year bond sale last week saw
Italy pay its highest borrowing rate in five years, although the
auction size was small at 3.5 billion euros. [nL8N1WR2S5]
    According to UniCredit, the Italian government has raised
325 billion euros in bills and bonds so far this year at an
average cost of just below 1 percent, mostly to refinance
maturing debt, which carried a cost of 1.3 percent on average.
    But the length of time these elevated costs persist is as
important as the peaks and troughs they may briefly hit, and
problems will mount if yields stay high into next year.
    Rabobank head of rates strategy Richard McGuire says a rise
in the weighted-average yield of Italian bonds is worrying as it
is consistent with a rising path in debt servicing costs.
    He estimates that a yield at a weighted-average maturity of
2.63 percent would keep debt/GDP levels constant. An Italian
bond maturing in June 2025, the closest in duration to the
weighted average maturity, has a yield of 3.06 percent
<IT509031=>.
    A more immediate hit is being felt by banks. Italian lenders
hold around 375 billion euros of domestic bonds - accounting for
10 percent of their assets - and the spike in yields, by eroding
the value of those holdings, eats into their capital levels.
    Any widening of the spread to 400 bps would force some
lenders to tap investors for cash, the Italian traders'
association Assiom Forex said recently. [nL8N1WH52F]
    Morgan Stanley estimates that the overall impact of spread
widening since the second quarter on Italian banks' capital
levels is between 1 and 14 bps.
    Based on the size of their bond portfolios and the starting
levels of their Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - a core measure of a
bank's financial strength from a regulator standpoint - Banco
BPM, UBI and BMPS are most vulnerable, Morgan Stanley said.
    It's no surprise that a jump in Italian yields is usually
accompanied by a plunge in bank stocks, often spilling into
European markets.
    In that environment, confidence in policymakers' ability to
stop market turmoil turning into a crisis can easily evaporate,
forcing them to act quickly. 
    May offered proof; spreads briefly topped 300 bps on fears
of a snap election that could become a de facto referendum on
euro membership. 5-Star and the League - the parties comprising
Italy's coalition - the quickly moved to form a government.
    An unwinding of ECB stimulus and higher U.S. Treasury yields
also make for a volatile backdrop.
    Contagion into the euro zone has been remarkably subdued
considering Italy is the bloc's third-biggest economy. That too
may change. 
    One channel could be the investment industry, should Italian
bond losses force fund managers to sell Spanish or Portuguese
debt to protect portfolio returns for the year.
    ""Like it or not, the development of the Italy-Germany spread
will decide the performance of most euro bond portfolios this
year, even those not invested in Italy,"" said Commerzbank's
Leister.

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - British PM Theresa May's
encounter with her EU peers yielded nothing materially new, as
expected, but at least the post-summit mood appears to be less
poisonous than that after the Salzburg meeting of a few weeks
back. Provisional plans for a one-off November summit have been
put on hold unless Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier spots major
progress between now and then. That could end up compressing the
timeframe for a deal further - but then there was always a
strong chance that this would have to go down to the wire at the
EU's regular December summit anyhow. UK media have latched onto
EU officials' statements that May said she would consider a
proposal to extend the post-Brexit transition by a year if
needed (""Brextra Time! screams a dismayed Sun headline) and hard
Brexiters at home are predictably enraged. With May having left
Brussels, EU leaders now get down to other matters such as
strengthening the eurozone, with final news conferences due mid-
to late-afternoon. 
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he sees no
room for changing the Italian draft budget for 2019 ahead of the
meeting in Rome this afternoon between EU Commissioner Pierre
Moscovici and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria. The two are due to
hold a joint news conference at which Moscovici could give the
clearest signals yet about what action Brussels intends to take
on the expansionary budget. Separately, in what is surely a jibe
at critics in Berlin and elsewhere, Italian Deputy Prime
Minister Matteo Salvini is being quoted as saying he may
consider running for the presidency of the European Commission,
the watchdog of the EU's rules.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
This week’s world market bounce has faded fast as hawkish noises
from the Federal Reserve, some negative earnings surprises and
the U.S. Treasury’s report on trade-related currency
manipulation have all quickly eclipsed any renewed optimism.
Although the Treasury report didn’t formally designate China as
a currency manipulator, it detailed concerns about how Beijing
has allowed the yuan to slide this year as U.S. tariffs were
imposed and it was widely seen as a warning about further trade
restrictions. The onshore yuan has fallen to its lowest since
January last year and Shanghai stocks plummeted more than 2
percent to their lowest in four years – now down more than 30
percent from 2018’s peaks and fully half their levels just three
years ago. Other Asia bourses from HK to Seoul to Tokyo were all
in the red too, but all by less than 1 percent. The minutes of
the Fed’s latest policy meeting added to the angst, showing the
decision to raise rates last month was unanimous and the
policymaking committee all behind further tightening despite
repeated criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. 
    The combination of Fed and China fears pushed 10-year
Treasury yields back above 3.2 percent for the first time in
over a week, lifting the dollar broadly. Euro/dollar skidded
below $1.15 overnight, the dollar’s DXY index was higher and
Japan’s yen outperformed amid the fresh equity market jitters.
Wall St stocks ended slightly lower late Wednesday, with
disappointing Q3 updates from the likes of IBM and Home Depot
souring the mood along with the spikey Fed minutes. The Chinese
nerves and higher dollar dragged MSCI’s emerging market index
down 0.8 percent early Thursday and a tentative recovery in many
emerging market currencies was stopped in its tracks. 
    Sterling was weaker against the euro and dollar as
indications from this week’s European Union summit on Brexit
were that a deal with the UK was still some way off and there
was insufficient progress to call a special summit on the issue
for November. That now pushes the timeline to December 14’s
summit and right to the wire for parliamentary approval in time
for a formal exit from the bloc next March. Softer-than-forecast
UK inflation numbers for September also weighed on the pound,

resilience during the sovereign debt crisis and will be able
also to cope with the draft budgetary plan of Italy, the
chairman of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno said on
Thursday.
    On Monday, Italy sent to the European Commission its draft
budget assumptions for 2019 under which its headline budget
deficit is to rise to 2.4 percent of GDP, tripling the target
agreed on with the Commission by the previous government.
    Euro zone officials worry that increased borrowing by Italy,
which has the second highest debt to GDP ratio in Europe at 133
percent, could trigger another sovereign debt crisis like the
one started by Greece in 2010.
    Speaking before an EU summit, Centeno said Italy's budget
plans were not on the agenda, and would be dealt with by the
Commission and euro zone finance ministers in due time.
    ""In the last decade the euro showed a great deal of
resilience to deal with crises and I am sure that we will be
able to cope with the budgetary plans in the different member
states, and certainly also with Italy,"" Centeno said.

    VIENNA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Germany should push Bundesbank
chief Jens Weidmann as a successor to European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi and the government is making a grave
mistake in not pushing harder, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny
said on Thursday.
    Draghi's job will become available at the end of next
October. By that time Nowotny - the head of the Austrian
National Bank and a moderate policy hawk who has often sided
with Weidmann - will have left his post too.
    ""I would have welcomed a candidacy of Weidmann very much,""
Nowotny told the Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten newspaper."" I
personally believe it is a grave political mistake by (German
Chancellor) Angela Merkel that she is no longer pursuing
Weidmann's candidacy further.""
    Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau is now
considered the frontrunner in the race but no real discussion is
likely until after the European Parliament elections next
spring, when the ECB job is expected to  be decided in a package
that also includes the heads of the EU Commission and Council.
    Despite the political sensitivity of the race, Weidmann has
been outspoken in criticising the fiscal plans of Italy, the
euro zone's third biggest economy. He said on Wednesday that
monetary policy normalisation will place an increasing burden on
highly indebted countries so there is no place for leniency with
Rome on European fiscal rules. [nF9N1U500N]
    His repeated spats with Italy over fiscal prudence has
irritated political circles in Rome, making opposition to
Weidmann's candidacy almost certain.
    Weidmann, a top notch economist, has also come under fire
for his persistent opposition to the ECB's 2.6 trillion euro
asset purchase programme. 
    Unveiled during a period of crisis, the programme is
credited with reviving growth, and some argue that Weidmann
would struggle to unite the Governing Council after having
opposed its hallmark policy programme for so long. 
    ""It would be good if someone from the biggest economy in the
euro area stood at the top of the ECB,"" Nowotny told the paper,
adding that an ECB president needs political sensitivity and
practical experience as well as being a good economist.

    ROVINJ, Croatia, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Croatia's economy is
likely to expand less than 3 percent this year and next, and the
country may be hampered in future by growing competition to
attract tourists and investors and a shortage of workers as
young people move away, the central bank chief said on Thursday.
    Croatia has one of the slowest growth rates among its
emerging market peers in central and eastern Europe. Analysts
have warned for years that Zagreb must improve its business
climate to draw in more investment money.
    ""We see Croatia's growth rate at 2.7 percent this year and
at 2.8 percent in 2019,"" central bank governor Boris Vujcic told
an economic conference in the northern Adriatic resort of
Rovinj. Last year the economy grew 2.9 percent.
    Vujcic said that at the moment a key growth driver was
consumer spending, but he said there were several short-term and
longer-term risks facing the country. 
    They include external factors such as recoveries in tourism
in Mediterranean competitors like Greece, Turkey and Tunis, and
potential fiscal problems in Italy, one of Croatia's top three
trading partners.
    Tourism accounts for almost 20 percent of Croatia's economic
output.
    ""Rising trade protectionism measures globally are also a
potential risk. In the longer term, Croatia's aging population

    ROVINJ, Croatia, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Croatia's economy is
likely to expand less than 3 percent this year and next, and the
country may be hampered in future by growing competition to
attract tourists and investors and a shortage of workers as
young people move away, the central bank chief said on Thursday.
    Croatia has one of the slowest growth rates among its
emerging market peers in central and eastern Europe. Analysts
have warned for years that Zagreb must improve its business
climate to draw in more investment money.
    ""We see Croatia's growth rate at 2.7 percent this year and
at 2.8 percent in 2019,"" central bank governor Boris Vujcic told
an economic conference in the northern Adriatic resort of
Rovinj. Last year the economy grew 2.9 percent.
    Vujcic said that at the moment a key growth driver was
consumer spending, but he said there were several short-term and
longer-term risks facing the country. 
    They include external factors such as recoveries in tourism
in Mediterranean competitors like Greece, Turkey and Tunis, and
potential fiscal problems in Italy, one of Croatia's top three
trading partners.
    Tourism accounts for almost 20 percent of Croatia's economic
output.
    ""Rising trade protectionism measures globally are also a
potential risk. In the longer term, Croatia's aging population
combined with emigration of many young people to work in other
European Union countries is also a threat,"" Vujcic said.
    He said a later retirement age and drawing in foreign
workers were among the solutions for these problems.
    ""Unless we do something fairly quickly it will become a
serious problem for our growth prospects. By current estimates,
Croatia could see a reduction of its active population by

    LJUBLJANA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A dispute over Italy's
proposed budget is expected to have little effect on the euro
zone, the deputy governor of Slovenia's central bank told
Reuters on Thursday.
    The European Commission says the Italy's proposed budget
would push up Italy's public debt, which is already around 130
percent of GDP, the highest in the euro zone after Greece
[nL8N1WV1L6].
    Italian government bond yields have climbed since the budget
was proposed, partly on concern the Commission would reject it -
an unprecedented move [nNRA7569lz]. But so far the row over
Italy has not spilled over into other euro zone bond markets
[nL8N1WS26W].
    ""Potentially the influence could be big if that would spread
over Europe, but I expect de facto influence will be small or
negligible,"" Bank of Slovenia Deputy Governor Primoz Dolenc said
on the sidelines of a banking conference. 
    He also said the European Central Bank is preparing for all
possibilities regarding Britain's exit from the European Union. 
So far, the EU and Britain have reached no agreement on the
terms of Britain's departure, which is due to take place in less
than six months [nL8N1WY1X5].
    Asked about the possibility Britain would leave without an
agreement, Dolenc said: ""It is hard to comment what the
influence would be on the monetary policy or the duties of ECB.
ECB is preparing on all scenarios and we will be ready whatever
happens.""
    He said he expected ECB interest rates to remain low 
through the summer of 2019. ""Interest rates will be low for a
long time still, probably through the summer of 2019.""
    Dolenc has led the Bank of Slovenia since former governor
Bostjan Jazbec resigned in April to take a position on the EU's
Single Resolution Board.

    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - With five months to
go, Prime Minister Theresa May still can’t come up with a plan
that satisfies the European Union and hard-line
parliamentarians. To avoid a chaotic Brexit, at least one side
must cave. That won’t happen until the disastrous alternative
gets even closer.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Prime Minister Theresa May on Oct. 18 signalled she would
consider extending a so-called transition period “for a matter
of months” after Britain leaves the European Union.
    - With less than six months before Britain is due to quit
the EU, talks have stalled over how to deal with the border
between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
    - At an EU summit in Brussels on Oct. 17, several leaders
and diplomats said May had offered nothing new to strike the
kind of breakthrough needed to move forward.
    - EU negotiators are insisting that Britain commit to keep
Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union -
thereby avoiding a hard border with Ireland - if no other
agreement can be reached. Negotiations about a broader trade
agreement would only begin in earnest after Britain formally
leaves the bloc in March 2019. These talks would take place
during an “implementation period” which is due to end in
December 2020.
    - “A further idea that has emerged, and it is an idea at
this stage, is to create an option to extend the implementation
period for a matter of months, and it would only be a matter of
months,” May told reporters on the second day of the summit.

    By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
    LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - European shares swung back into
the red on Thursday as fears of rising rates and disappointing
earnings from U.S. industrials dragged Wall Street down, while
HeidelbergCement's profit warning sank European construction
stocks.
    The euro zone's leading stocks index <.STOXX50E> attempted a
recovery but finished the day down 1 percent while the
pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> index slipped 0.5 percent and
Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> slid 1.1 percent. 
    A weaker open on Wall Street sent European stocks south.
U.S. stocks fell across the board as weak earnings reports from
industrial firms triggered worries over climbing costs and the
impact of tariffs. [nL3N1WY4MB]
    Meanwhile, Europe's third-quarter earnings season is kicking
up a gear after indexes hit a 22-month low last week when
jitters over rising U.S. bond yields and geopolitical worries
rattled global markets.
    ""A reality check with companies is clearly welcome with
global uncertainties related to trade flows,"" said Kepler
Cheuvreux analysts.
    French supermarket operator Carrefour <CARR.PA> jumped up
9.3 percent as it reported a sales growth acceleration in France
and Brazil outweighing weakness in Southern Europe. [nL8N1WX5WG]
    ""A food-driven volume recovery is a key element to a
successful, sustainable food retail turnaround and there are
signs that Carrefour is beginning to deliver on this,"" said HSBC
analysts.
    Tech <.SX8P> was the worst-performing European sector, down
2.1 percent, with banks <.SX7P> down 1.7 percent as investors
shed stocks most sensitive to the economic cycle.
    Spanish banks Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC>, Bankinter <BKT.MC>,
Bankia <BKIA.MC>, Caixabank <CABK.MC>, BBVA <BBVA.MC>, and
Santander <SAN.MC> all fell between 2 and 6.7 percent after the
Supreme Court ruled banks must pay stamp duty on mortgage loans,
potentially costing them billions of euros in compensation.
[nL8N1WY30D]
    The biggest earnings disappointment was HeidelbergCement
<HEIG.DE>, one of the world's largest cement makers, which fell
8.6 percent after it cut its profit guidance for 2018, citing
bad weather in the United States and higher-than-expected energy
cost inflation. [nL8N1WY1E2]
    ""These issues are not entirely unexpected but the impact is
modestly higher than expected,"" said UBS analysts.
    Other European construction materials firms tumbled too:
Buzzi Unicem <BZU.MI> fell 6.4 percent, LafargeHolcim <LHN.S>
fell 3.9 percent and CRH <CRH.I> down 4.4 percent. 
    Media <.SXMP> was among the best-performing sectors, up 0.4
percent, lifted by French advertising agency Publicis <PUBP.PA>
which reported stronger third-quarter sales pushing its shares
up 3.8 percent.
    The media sector has now overtaken the tech sector as
Europe's top-performing this year, in a sign of the waning
dominance of tech.
    The telecoms sector <.SXKP> also gained, boosted by Sweden's
Tele2 <TEL2b.ST> which rose 4.7 percent after lifting its
guidance on better-than-expected results. [nFWN1WX14W]
    Mobile telecom equipment maker Ericsson <ERICb.ST> also
surged up 6.2 percent after its third-quarter profit topped
forecasts, boosted by sales of next-generation 5G gear in North
America. [nL8N1WY0WP] 
    Novartis <NOVN.S> shares rose 1.8 percent after the Swiss
pharmaceutical company announced it would  acquire U.S.-based
cancer drugmaker Endocyte <ECYT.O> for $2.1 billion in cash in
an expansion of its radiopharmaceuticals business. [nL3N1WY2CM]
    ""Today is less about the earnings number and more about the
company’s transition to much more of a pure-play pharma
business, which seems to be going down well with investors who
have shown increasing interest in this name over the past few
weeks,"" said Berenberg analysts.

    By Jan Strupczewski and Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's 2019 budget draft is in
serious breach of EU budget rules, the European Commission told
Rome on Thursday, in a step that prepares the ground for what
would be an unprecedented rejection of a member state's fiscal
plan.
    The Commission said in a letter to Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria, published on its website, that planned government spending
was too high, the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and
business cycle effects - would rise instead of fall, and that
Italian public debt would not fall in line with EU rules.
    ""Those three factors would seem to point to a particularly
serious non-compliance with the budgetary policy obligations
laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact,"" the letter said. 
    The Commission said that the draft budget envisaged a
nominal rate of growth of net government expenditure next year
of 2.7 percent, while EU rules allowed Italy only 0.1 percent.
    The structural deficit would rise 0.8 percent of GDP next
year, while a binding recommendation by EU finance ministers
from July obliged Rome to cut it by 0.6 percent of GDP.
    ""Moreover, with Italy's government debt standing at around
130 percent of GDP, our preliminary assessment also indicates
that Italy's plans would not ensure compliance with the debt
criterion benchmark ... which requires a steady reduction of the
debt level towards the 60 percent threshold,"" the letter said.
    The Commission also asked Tria to explain why he ignored a
negative opinion on the budget's macroeconomic assumptions from
the Parliamentary Budget Office - Italy's independent fiscal
monitoring institution - which also violates EU law.
    The Commission asked Rome to respond by Monday.
    The letter is part of required consultations between the
Commission and any euro zone government whose draft budget
clearly breaks EU rules.
    Unless the main parameters of the budget are changed, the 
Commission is likely to send the draft back to authorities in
Rome asking for changes for the first time since it got
draft-budget vetting powers in 2013.

ITALY-BUDGET/DI MAIO from ITALY-POLITICS/DI MAIO)
    FIGLINE VALDARNO, Italy Oct 18 (Reuters) - The head of
Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement Luigi Di Maio said on
Thursday that a dispute with the League over a tax amnesty
needed to be sorted out because it was upsetting financial
markets.
    ""We need a political clarification,"" Di Maio told reporters
in Tuscany after the two ruling parties had their first major
clash over the amnesty contained in the 2019 budget.
    Di Maio said a steep rise in yields on Italian government
bonds on Thursday was ""because markets think this government is
no longer united.""
    Di Maio, who is deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday the
legislative text of the amnesty had been ""manipulated"" after his
party had signed off on the measure in cabinet, raising doubts
about the stability of the coalition government.
    5-Star has always opposed amnesties - a frequently used
policy in Italy where people or companies can avoid being
pursued for tax dodging by paying a fee. 
    The right-wing League on the other hand favours amnesties,
which bring money into the Treasury and are popular with its
traditional voter-base of self-employed businessmen, a sector of
the population in which tax evasion is common.
    Di Maio said the ""manipulated"" text spelled out a far more
wide-ranging amnesty than 5-Star had agreed to. He did not
clarify who could have amended the document, but League Leader
Matteo Salvini said there had been no last-minute tampering.
    ""The terms of the decree will not change and everyone will
take responsibility for his actions,"" he said during a visit to
the northern city of Bolzano.
    Di Maio said he was confident the two parties would find ""a
point of compromise.""
    Asked by reporters in Brussels about a possible coalition
rift, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte - who is not from any
political party - replied: ""There is no division"". He added he
would work on the legislative text after returning to Rome on
Friday.

    By Francesco Guarascio
    BRUSSELS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's Prime Minister defended
its free-spending budget on Thursday, brushing off criticism
from Brussels as the European Commission stepped up pressure
over a draft it labelled an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal
rules.
    Giuseppe Conte also faced discontent over the 2019 fiscal
plan at home, calling a meeting of the government for Saturday
to stave off an emerging internal rift over conditions of a
partial tax amnesty.
    The draft, signed off by Italy's cabinet on Monday, will
hike the deficit at a time when EU regulations say it should be
falling, boost welfare spending and cut the retirement age.
    In the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to
Brussels rejecting the budget and to fines against Italy, the
Commission sent Rome a warning letter on Thursday.
    The document said the budget appeared to be in ""particularly
serious non-compliance"" with EU rules as its deviation from
targets was ""unprecedented"", and gave Rome until Oct. 22 to
respond. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    EU officials stressed they were seeking Italy's reply and
changes to the draft budget before taking any further measures.
""We have time,"" economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici told a
news conference in Rome after he handed the letter to Italy's
Finance Minister Giovanni Tria. 
    Conte said Italy was ready to reply to the commission's
concerns but he was not worried by the letter. He did not think
Italy's deviation from targets was large, and expected the
Commission to send similar letters to Spain, France and Portugal
[nL8N1WY6PV].
    ""Italy's is a case apart,"" an EU official told Reuters,
adding that letters to other governments will only warn against
possible budget risks [nL8N1WY4UV].
    Conte called the budget ""beautiful"", having said on
Wednesday on arriving for a two-day EU summit that he saw no
room for changing tack on it.
    If it is not amended, the Commission could reject the draft
by Oct. 29 in what would be an unprecedented move that could
further rattle financial markets. [nL8N1WV23B]. 
    The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yield
spreads hit its widest level in 5-1/2 years after news of the
Commission letter broke [nL8N1WY5V7].
        
    COALITION SPAT
    Other EU leaders also warned Italy about the budget, some in
public and others behind closed doors, as Conte laid out the
plans - an unusual move at an EU summit. [nS8N1VJ01E].
    Before the meeting, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said
fiscal rules should be respected by all.
    Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Twitter he had
expressed his concerns to Conte on Thursday, and that the
Commission had the Netherlands' full support in making sure EU
fiscal rules were respected.
    In what could be a further source of concern at home, Deputy
Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star party, said
on Wednesday a legislative text on a partial tax amnesty had
been ""manipulated"" before its final approval, raising doubts
about the stability of Italy's coalition government and about
the budget's revenues.
    The anti-establishment 5-Star has always opposed amnesties -
a frequently used policy in Italy where people or companies can
avoid being pursued for tax dodging by paying a fee. Its
coalition partner, the far-right League, favours amnesties,
which bring money into the treasury and are popular with voters.
    Di Maio said on Thursday the dispute needed to be sorted out
because it was upsetting financial markets. [nL8N1WY6Z6]
    Asked by reporters about the coalition rift, Conte - who is
not from any political party - replied: ""There is no division"". 
    But later in the day, he told a news conference he had
called a government meeting for Saturday to overcome political
differences over the text.

Scholz wants a global minimum corporate tax to prevent companies

reported, citing a tax expert at OECD.
    Scholz has asked the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
& Development (OECD) to consider the proposal, the newspaper
said. Countries can align tax laws according to OECD principles.
    Such a move would be an extension of BEPS, a set of OECD
policies to tackle tax avoidance strategies that allow
multinational companies to shift profits artificially to low or
no-tax locations.
    Scholz coordinated his proposal closely with France,
Handelsblatt said late on Thursday.
    He said the proposal has been well received but talks
remains at an early stage.
    ""In the context of the BEPS discussion, France and Germany
have proposed discussing a minimum tax and making it the
standard,"" the paper quoted OECD tax lead Pascal Saint-Amans as

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month
low on Friday after the European Union criticized Italy's
spending plans, raising fresh concern over conflict within the
common currency zone.
    Political wrangling over the budget in heavily indebted
Italy has seen the euro weaken over 1 percent versus the dollar
this week.
    In the first step of a procedure that could end with
Brussels rejecting the budget and fining Italy, the Commission
sent Rome a letter on Thursday calling a draft budget an
""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules [nL8N1WY6JF].     
    The single currency fell to an intra-day low of $1.1433
<EUR=EBS> close to a two-month low of $1.1432 hit on October 9.
    Italy is the third-largest economy of the 19-country euro
zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.
    The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields
reached its widest in 5 1/2 years after news of the Commission
letter broke [nL8N1WY5V7].
    ""The euro is already suffering considerably now, and that
would be worse if the crisis really gets going, [especially] as
the dollar is now providing attractive yields,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP yields moved notably
higher ""correlations could well strengthen and this would
provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the
tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the
European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.
    Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an
interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this
week, they were projecting an increase next
September[nL8N1WZ1A9]. 
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against major
peers, was 0.2 percent higher at 96.091 on Friday, close to a
two-month high of 96.155. The rise was driven by Thursday's
decline by the euro, which accounts for 57 percent of the index.
    Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel
Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90
percent done but that hurdles remained [nL8N1WZ1DC].
    Sterling rose to a day's high versus the dollar of $1.3038
<GBP=D3>, trading broadly flat. It also strengthened 0.1 percent
against the euro to 87.9 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    The Japanese yen <JPY=D3> weakened 0.23 percent versus the
dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.48.
    A global risk-off mood has prevailed this week amid tension
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy's budget woes and
U.S-Sino trade conflict.
    China's economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5
percent, its weakest since 2009 and below expectations, as a
campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States weighed on the economy [nL4N1WQ2N8].
    The yuan <CNY=D3> changed hands at 6.9420 on Friday, trading
down 0.1 percent versus the dollar, close to a two-month low. 
    ""Expectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to
depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,""
said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note.

    By Luiza Ilie
    BUCHAREST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A power struggle between
Romania's government and judiciary is reaching a tipping point
that risks driving a new wedge between the European Union and
its eastern members over democratic standards.
    Justice Minister Tudorel Toader has said he will soon decide
the future of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in
an anti-corruption drive which has won praise from Brussels for
exposing high-level graft, including the theft of EU funds.
    Augustin Lazar oversees around 2,500 prosecutors, including
anti-organised crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA.
    If Toader decides to trigger Lazar's dismissal, it will mark
the end of an era for Romania's prosecutors. The head of the DNA
has already been fired and DIICOT leader's mandate has expired.
    The government says the units have ruined innocent lives.
    Anti-corruption prosecutors have secured almost 5,000
convictions over the past five years, including 27 lawmakers and
83 mayors across parties, as well as ministers, county council
heads, state firm managers and magistrates.    
    Among them is Liviu Dragnea, leader of the ruling Social
Democrats, who was barred from becoming prime minister by a
conviction in the first of three investigations against him. He
denies all wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political
witch-hunt by the judiciary.
    In recent months, his party has launched a slew of bills to
overhaul criminal law and procedures to raise the burden of
proof. It has also set up a unit to investigate judges and
prosecutors for possible crimes and aims to reorganise judges
panels.
    European diplomats, who are seeking sanctions against fellow
east European states Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic
values, are concerned Romania is following suit.
    
    ""MOVING BACKWARDS""
     ""There is now the real risk that things are moving
backwards in a way that would be damaging not only for Romanian
democracy but for the place that it has built as an EU member
state,"" the EU executive's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans
said at a meeting of the European Parliament this month.
    ""The procedure that has been started recently in relation to
the general prosecutor raises similarly worrying concerns.""
    An EU advisory body for constitutional rights, the Venice
Commission, will issue an opinion on Romania later on Friday.
Its preliminary view said parts of the judicial overhaul ""are
likely to undermine the independence of Romanian judges and
prosecutors, and public confidence in the judiciary.""
    Any punitive measures against Romania similar to those the
EU is seeking for Hungary and Poland will depend on the outcome
of the wider legal changes the Social Democrats have initiated.
    On Monday, the government tightened hiring criteria for DNA
and DIICOT prosecutors via an emergency decree; as a result,
over 40 of those prosecutors will be reassigned to other work.
It said this was to address the Venice Commission's concerns.
    Dragnea and senior party members say they aim to curb abuses
by prosecutors and secret services, invoking the spectre of a
""parallel state"" that illegally wiretaps them.
    DNA chief Laura Codruta Kovesi lost her job in July after an
assessment by the justice minister similar to the one Lazar is
undergoing now, despite resistance from the judicial watchdog
and the president. [nL5N1T14PC]
    Other prosecutors and judges have had inspectors in their
offices looking for flaws in their work.
    ""There is a tactic of making examples out of high profile
legal professionals,"" one anti-corruption prosecutor told
Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect pending cases. 
    ""They're trying to show what happens if you don't behave.
And it is working. Some people in the judiciary are starting to
think, why I am fighting this?""
    Minister Toader triggered the evaluation of Lazar, who
oversees the prosecution service, or public ministry, in late
August, saying the decision did not come out of the blue.
    ""Over time, I have noticed how the public ministry has
veered away from its constitutional role of guaranteeing
citizens’ rights and liberties,"" he said. ""As before (with
Kovesi), I will make a radiograph of the prosecutor general’s
management and I will reach a conclusion.""
    The minister told private television station Antena3 earlier
this week his conclusion was days away.
    Lazar, who was appointed three years ago and has accused the
government of trying to politicise the judiciary, said
prosecutors' work was transparent and he did not fear being
dismissed.
    ""It is unfortunately a very sensitive time for the Romanian
judiciary and rule of law,"" he told a conference after the
minister's announcement, the only time he addressed the issue.
    ""It's a context in which manipulating public opinion is
often used as an instrument to destabilise prosecutors' work.""
    The prosecutor general is in charge of requests to lift the
immunity of lawmakers for investigations and has a vote on the
country's judicial watchdog.
    Some critics have said he has not been aggressive enough in
cleaning up the ranks of corrupt or inefficient colleagues, but
many prosecutors admire him for standing up for them.
    DNA statements show the bulk of its anti-corruption cases
concern public works contracts given to firms which courts later
found to be paying bribes; many were overpriced and some
payments, including with EU funds, were made for fictitious
works.
    Timmermans said any changes that would weaken oversight of
how EU taxpayers' money was spent in Romania ""will trigger an
immediate response from the Commission.""
    Investors' associations have repeatedly warned that
corruption is a strong deterrent for business.
    Dragnea, who is also lower house speaker, was given a
two-year suspended sentence in a vote rigging case and also
sentenced to three and a half years in jail for helping keep two
party employees on the payroll of the state child protection
agency. He has appealed and is due in court on Nov 5.[L8N1TN5FJ]
    He is also under investigation in a third case on suspicion
of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state
projects, some of them EU-funded, charges he denies.
[nL8N1NJ33T]
        
    CHECKS AND BALANCES
    Romania's centrist president was forced to sign the Social
Democrats' overhaul of the judiciary into law this month after
he used up his chances to object. It removes his veto rights on
appointing top prosecutors, one of the key checks and balances.
    Toader's nominee to replace Kovesi at the head of
anti-corruption unit DNA has raised concerns she might be soft
on high-level crime.[nL8N1WO3H3]
    In August, riot police fired tear gas into the crowd at an
anti-government rally and beat protesters holding their hands
up. [nL5N1V164B]
    An existing judicial inspectorate, whose chief Toader has
kept on after his mandate expired, has been investigating
magistrates at a rapid pace. Many of those probed have
criticized the legislative changes.
    U.S. ambassador Hans Klemm told law students this month the
judicial overhaul ""creates greater opportunities to coerce and
punish troublesome magistrates.""    
    ""Cloaked in the mantle of concern for due process and human
rights, some of these changes are a clear attempt to protect
vested interests from an independent judiciary,"" he said.
    The ruling party does not always succeed. This month, the
Constitutional Court struck down most of alterations to criminal
procedures that were challenged and which would have raised the
burden of proof on all criminal investigations.
    The Court will discuss challenges brought against proposed
changes to the criminal code on Oct. 24. [nL8N1U03H8]
    The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives aim
to align legislation with EU norms and address abuses, citing
acquittals by higher courts, although these are rare, and
corruption investigations against some prosecutors.
    Dragnea has also said that Romania's Secret Service (SRI),
which has been gathering wiretap evidence for prosecutors based
on court warrants, has been abusing its powers, faking evidence
and illegally intercepting ""millions of Romanians.""
    He said either parliament or government should pass a bill
to retroactively cancel wiretap evidence. That would jeopardise
hundreds of verdicts ranging from corruption to human
trafficking and potentially Dragnea's cases as well.
    DNA said that just over 36,000 people, not millions, have
been wire-tapped since 2005.
    ""When the dust settles,"" the anti-corruption prosecutor
said, ""it will take years to figure out how these laws were
changed and what is left.""

    MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The radical
government wants to boost spending despite Brussels’ opposition.
Lengthy procedures mean the spat will drag on until European
Parliament elections in May. With radical parties gaining
ground, the new Commission could be more lenient. But markets
won’t wait that long.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Oct. 18 his
coalition government would move ahead with a planned
expansionary budget despite criticism from the European
Commission and the risk of fines for breaching euro zone fiscal
rules.
    - Italy is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
in 2019 to finance measures including wider unemployment
benefits and an early retirement scheme, up from a target
deficit of 1.8 percent this year. The budget contravenes EU
rules that require Italy and other indebted countries to
steadily narrow the fiscal deficit to zero.
    - The European Commission said the budget plans would
constitute an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules in a
letter to Rome on Oct. 18. The Commission has the power to
launch a so-called excessive deficit procedure against Italy
that could ultimately lead to a fine.
    - Italy’s public debt stood at around 131 percent of GDP in
2017, the second-highest as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone
after Greece.
    - Italian 10-year government bond yields rose to 4.2 percent
in early morning trading on Oct. 19, the highest level in
four-and-a-half years.

    ROVINJ, Croatia, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Croatia's mandatory
private pension funds said on Friday they are hoping the state
will sell shares in big companies so they can diversify more
into equity investments, which would help reduce the public
debt.
    ""It would have many benefits, like lowering of the public
debt by 5-7 percent, saving on interest rates for the state and
giving a boost to the local capital market,"" Dubravko Stimac,
head of one of the four funds, PBZ Croatia Osiguranje, told an
economic conference in the Adriatic town of Rovinj.
    Croatia supplements its state pension system by requiring
workers to put part of their salaries into four mandatory
private funds, which have piled up assets worth 97.7 billion
kuna, or some 27 percent of gross domestic product.
    Although they are permitted to held equity shares, the funds
mainly invest in state debt, since Croatia's capital markets are
shallow.
    ""At the moment the pension funds could invest some 15
billion kuna into possible privatisation,"" said Damir Grbavac,
head of one of the other funds, Raiffeisenbank pension fund.
    The state still dominates the economy in Croatia, where
growth lags other EU emerging markets in central and
southeastern Europe. Government officials have discussed selling
stakes in public companies such as power board HEP or highway
management firm HAC, but no firm decisions have been taken.
    Croatia is trying to reduce its public debt towards 60
percent of GDP, from around 75 percent, in an effort to adopt
the euro currency within 6-7 years.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month
low on Friday after the European Union criticised Italy's
spending plans, raising fresh concern about a conflict within
the common currency zone.
    Political wrangling over the budget in heavily indebted
Italy has seen the euro weaken over 1 percent versus the dollar
this week.
    The European Commision on Thursday sent Rome a letter
calling a draft budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal
rules, the first step of a procedure that could end with
Brussels rejecting the budget and fining Italy. [nL8N1WY6JF].   
 
    The single currency fell to an intra-day low of $1.1433
<EUR=EBS> close to a two-month low of $1.1432 hit on October 9.
At 1100 GMT it traded 0.1 percent up on the day at $1.1464.
    Italy is the third-largest economy of the 19-country euro
zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.
    The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields
reached its widest in 5 1/2 years after news of the Commission
letter broke [nL8N1WY5V7].
    ""The euro is already suffering considerably, and that could
get worse if the crisis really gets going, [especially] as the
dollar is now providing attractive yields,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP yields moved notably
higher ""correlations could well strengthen and this would
provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the
tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the
European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.
    Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an
interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this
week, they were projecting an increase next
September[nL8N1WZ1A9]. 
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against major
peers, traded flat at 95.9 on Friday, close to a two-month high
of 96.155.
    Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel
Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90
percent done but that hurdles remained [nL8N1WZ1DC].
    Sterling rose to a day's high versus the dollar of $1.3038
<GBP=D3>, trading broadly flat. It also strengthened 0.1 percent
against the euro to 87.9 pence <EURGBP=D3>.
    The Japanese yen <JPY=D3> weakened 0.2 percent versus the
dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.37.
    A global risk-off mood has prevailed this week amid tension
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy's budget woes and
U.S-Sino trade conflict.
    China's economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5
percent, its weakest since 2009 and below expectations, as a
campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United
States weighed on the economy [nL4N1WQ2N8].
    The yuan <CNY=D3> changed hands at 6.9341 on Friday, trading
down 0.1 percent versus the dollar, close to a two-month low. 
    ""Expectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to
depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,""
said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note.

    * Danish prime minister calls for European cooperation
    * EU lawmaker pushes for public enquiry

    By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - European politicians have
called for action to tackle dividend stripping after Reuters and
other media revealed how large banks were involved in trading
schemes that cost taxpayers billions of euros.
    In Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation,
prosecutors in Cologne are investigating banks involved in the
trades, which secured illicit double tax rebates on dividend
payouts. 
    Danish authorities are also seeking to recover hundreds of
millions of euros in tax rebates they paid out after falling
victim to a similar scheme and have filed dozens of lawsuits
this year against individuals in the United States. 
    ""It is large-scale greed, and we will pursue the culprits,""
said Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen.
    ""That this is a problem across Europe makes me even more
upset ... The answer ... is closer international cooperation.""
    Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly
involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of
internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as
part of a European media investigation called the ""cum-ex files""
coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv. [nL8N1WP2EL] 
    These documents showed that prosecutors in Cologne opened a
tax investigation into Santander <SAN.MC> in June. They believe
its role in the scheme was to carry out trades. Other banks are
being investigated as part of the wider probe.
    Santander said it was ""fully cooperating"" with German
authorities and conducting an internal investigation. 
    Jeppe Kofod, a Dutch member of the European Parliament's
committee on tax evasion and financial crime, called for a
public hearing by lawmakers to quiz banks about the scheme. 
    ""Several of the biggest European banks are involved,"" Kofod
told Reuters. ""It is a European issue."" 
    Germany made three attempts to stamp out the practice by
changing and clarifying the law in 2007 and 2009 before finally
succeeding in 2012.
    
    TIGHTER CHECKS
    The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark has
prompted other countries, including Austria and Belgium, to open
their own investigations. They have discovered that they were
also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.
    A spokeswoman for the Belgian finance ministry said it was
investigating a similar fraud after it discovered illicit tax
reclaims. It repaid 201 million euros before halting far larger
reclaims, some as recent as 2017.
    State prosecutors in Austria have also opened an
investigation into similar trades, a spokeswoman said.
    ""The culprits tried to replicate the fraudulent scheme used
in Germany in Austria,"" she said, adding that a joint
investigative team had been launched with prosecutors in
Cologne. ""The investigation is very advanced,"" she said.
    Norway also fell victim to the fraud in 2013 with a loss of
580,000 Norwegian krone ($71,270) according to the tax
authorities. Norway was was able to stop 10 further attempts in
2015 in fraudulent claims of $4.3 million.
    ""After discovering these fraud attempts we introduced much
tighter checks before paying refunds,"" said Hans Christian
Holte, director general of the Norwegian Tax Administration.
    The circle of countries that theoretically could have fallen
victim is even wider, according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, which has monitored the situation. 
    Responding to the investigation, French Budget Minister
Gerald Darmanin said on twitter: ""If the frauds are confirmed,
we will be ruthless.""
    The scheme involved trading a company stock rapidly around a
syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the
impression of numerous owners - each entitled to a tax rebate.
    ""We need to look at our laws to make sure they can stop this
kind of large-scale tax fraud,"" said Tove Maria Ryding of the
European Network on Debt and Development, which campaigns on tax
issues.

    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The international group that
monitors money laundering worldwide said on Friday Iran had
until February to complete reforms that would bring it into line
with global norms or face consequences.
    The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force said after a
meeting of its members that it was disappointed that Tehran had
acted on only nine out of 10 of its guidelines despite pledges
to make the grade.
    ""We expect Iran to move swiftly to implement the commitments
that it undertook at a high level so long ago,"" said Marshall
Billingslea, the U.S. assistant Treasury Secretary for terrorist
financing, after chairing an FATF meeting.
    ""In line with that, we expect that it will have adopted all
of these measures by February. If by February 2019 Iran has not
yet done so, then we will take further steps,"" he said. 
    In the mean time, the FATF said it had decided to continue
suspending counter-measures, which can go as far as limiting or
even banning transactions with a country.
    Iran's parliament approved some new measures against funding
terrorism earlier this month under pressure to adopt
international standards. But FATF said that it could only
consider fully enacted legislation.
    Members of FATF had already given Tehran until this month to
bring its laws against money-laundering and funding of terrorism
up to its guidelines.
    Otherwise, Iran risked being returned to a blacklist of
non-compliant countries that makes foreign investors and banks
reluctant to deal with it.
    Britain, France and Germany are trying to keep some
financial channels open to Iran after the United States pulled
out of a 2015 nuclear deal in May and re-imposed sanctions.
    Analysts say that inclusion on the FATF's blacklist could
effectively make that all but impossible.

    By Ritvik Carvalho
    LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Investors shed Italian bonds on
Friday, driving their yields to 4-year highs while the euro fell
to a 2-month low as the European Union called Rome's draft
budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules.
    U.S. stocks were set for a higher open, however, as a
handful of major U.S. corporations beat results forecasts,
offsetting concerns about political and growth risks in Europe,
China and Saudi Arabia. [.N]
    Late on Thursday, the European Commission told Italy that
planned government spending was too high, its structural deficit
would rise instead of fall and public debt would not fall in
line with EU rules. [nL8N1WY6JF]
    Italy is the third-largest economy in the 19-country euro
zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.
    While it isn't unusual for the EU to ask member countries
for clarification on points of their budget plans, the sending
of a formal letter and the tone of the comments were
particularly strong, analysts said. 
    ""The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described
the budget as 'an obvious deviation' from prior commitments, on
an 'unprecedented' scale,"" Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim
Reid said in a note to clients. 
    Top euro zone officials insisted Italy's budget plan did not
pose a ""Greek-like"" threat to European financial stability,
[nL8N1WY6VZ] but the row nonetheless led money market investors
to start pushing back expectations for the timing of a European
Central Bank rate rise. [GVD/EUR]  
    Italy's benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent
in early trade on Friday, the highest since February 2014. They
last traded at 3.71 percent. <IT10YT=RR>
    Italian stocks <.FTMIB> fell 0.7 percent, while its bank
stocks <.FTIT8300> were last down 2.2 percent.

    The budget dispute initially weighed on the euro, which fell
to a two-month low, before recovering by afternoon trade in
Europe, last up 0.2 percent on the day. <EUR=D4> [FRX/]
    The closely watched Italian/German bond yield spread hit a
fresh 5-1/2 year high of 338 basis points. <DE10IT10=RR>
    Portuguese and Spanish bonds, that have been resilient so
far through the Italian budget worries, were also sold, with
several analysts suggesting that this was the first sign of
contagion from Italy. [GVD/EUR]
    Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP (Italian government bond)
yields moved notably higher ""correlations could well strengthen
and this would provide further downside pressure for the euro"".
    Stock markets all round were a bit lacklustre: data showing
China's economy growing at its slowest pace since 2009 weighed
on shares in Asia, although Chinese shares staged a recovery
after the securities regulator announced a series of measures to
aid the market. [nL3N1WZ1AA]
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> was up 0.2 percent after earlier falling as much
as 0.9 percent ahead of the China GDP reading.
    Australian shares <.AXJO> fell 0.05 percent and Japan's
Nikkei average <.N225> ended 0.6 percent lower for its third
straight week of declines.
    Stocks in Europe managed a modest rise at the start of
trading, but fell back into the red. The pan-European STOXX 600
<.STOXX> index was down 0.1 percent. <.EU>
    The MSCI All-Country World Index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which
tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent on the day.
It was set for a fourth weekly loss on the trot, which would
make it its longest weekly losing streak since the end of 2015.
    1609 out of 2767 stocks on the index are in a bear market

    In currencies, the dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of the
greenback's value against major peers, was 0.1 percent lower at

    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's
policy meeting will be relegated to a sideshow next week as the
wrangle over Italy's budget takes the main stage.
    The Italian government is looking to boost spending in the
hope of engineering faster economic growth.
    But its resolve to breach European Union fiscal rules will
be put to the test as it faces a rebuke from the Commission,
downgrades by credit rating agencies, and a market selloff that
may negate the very stimulus it has hoped for.
    Italy has until Monday to explain to the Commission its
breach of rules and faces the rejection of its budget, which may
eventually lead to sanctions. Neither side has any incentive to
back down for now. 
    For the Rome government, standing up to Brussels could
translate into votes, while for the Commission, giving in would
create a dangerous precedent that could destabilize the euro
zone, especially since the bloc has already been lenient with
Italy's excessive spending.
    The deadlock is costly. Italian bond yields hit their
highest level since early 2014 on Friday and the premium
investors demand in comparison to German debt is at a five and a
half year high. 
    This could hit the economy as Italy sits on a debt pile
worth 130 percent of GDP, the second-highest debt ratio in
Europe after Greece, which has just exited a bailout. 
    ""The European process might not be central,"" Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients.
    ""Ultimately it is the market forces, potentially triggered
by the rating agencies, and the reaction of the real economy to
the tightening in financial conditions, which will seal the fate
of the current experiment in fiscal loosening in Italy.""
    Moody's and Standard and Poor's are both expected to review
their Italian ratings before the month's end and downgrades to
one level above junk are expected by many. 
    While much of this is already priced in, any commentary that
would raise the prospect of a cut to 'junk' could trigger a sell
off as it would carry implications from a loss off access to
central bank facilities to exclusion from investor portfolios.
    Yet even these apparent risks are unlikely now to force the
government to back down and further escalation is likely before
a compromise is found. 
    ""So long as financial market pressures remain manageable, we
find it rational for the government to stick to its strategy
of maintaining tensions with EU institutions, given that it
continues to pay off in terms of popularity,"" Barclays added.
    Commerzbank said an eventual solution may be to finance more
Italian spending from underutilised structural funds instead of
directly burdening the budget.

    ECB
    Italy is also expected to be a top item for the ECB, which
is all but certain to keep policy on hold on Thursday and likely
put off discussion about its reinvestment policy until December.
    Having already made clear that Italy's government is
damaging businesses and households, ECB chief Mario Draghi is
expected to repeat that no help is coming if investors start
dumping Italian assets  en masse. 
    Italian officials have suggested the ECB should use its 2.6
trillion euro bond purchases scheme, due to end in December, to
support stabilise markets.  
    ""It seems that the message needs to be made loud (er) and
clear (er) that quantitative easing is part of the monetary
policy framework and cannot be used to help individual national
governments,"" BAML said.
    The ECB targets an inflation rate just below 2 percent and
has rejected the idea of going beyond this mandate, especially
to help one particular euro area country over another.
    Yet Italy's difficulties could also spell trouble for the
entire bloc, which may eventually prove too difficult to ignore.
    A loss of confidence could spread and drag growth, forcing
the ECB to maintain stimulus longer than it hoped. With much of
its firepower already exhausted from years of support, it has
virtually no scope to extend its bond purchase scheme.

dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week
and the Reuters stories related to them.
    
    1/SEVEN DEADLY…
    The real possibility of the yuan weakening to the
7-per-dollar mark last seen in 2008, hangs over China, emerging
markets and global equities. The thinking so far has been that
the risk of capital outflows, along the lines of what happened
in 2016, would dissuade Beijing from allowing such a slide in
the currency. But more recently, weak benchmark yuan/dollar
fixings, a drop in the trade-weighted yuan index to below 2017
lows, and a flurry of comments and measures from policymakers
reveal both a sense of panic and determination to prop up the
economy.
    With third quarter economic growth slowing to crisis-era
lows, no let-up in Washington's trade rhetoric and a stock
market that's lost 28 percent since February, China has been
forced to ease monetary conditions and is cajoling banks to lend
to small firms. A weaker yuan would complement those stimulus
efforts. 
    Yet a 7-per-dollar yuan would erode faith in the China's
stability and possibly provoke more U.S. ire. And coming on top
of rising U.S. yields, Brexit and Italian politics, it would add
another layer of worry to world markets -- the last thing
investors want to see.

    2/EUROPE'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE        
    Stock market turmoil, conflict over a contentious Italian
budget, high oil prices, sputtering economic growth -- not quite
the backdrop a central bank wants to see three months before its
 it ends its stimulus programme. 
    But that is exactly what the European Central Bank faces
when it meets on Thursday. For now, the heightened risks to the
growth outlook are not expected to derail its plans to end QE by
year-end, but the bank could downgrade the growth risk
assessment in its policy statement.
    That would be a dovish signal and one likely to cheer euro
zone bond markets which have been guided already to not expect a
rise in the ECB's record low rates until well into 2019. No
wonder then, that the gap between short-dated bond yields in the
United States and Germany are at their widest in 30 years, while
10-year euro area bond yields (with the exception of Italy) have
been largely insulated from the recent spike U.S. Treasury
yields.

    3/HOME RUN
    The U.S. housing market, the store of much of Americans'
wealth, has taken a leg down of late, against the backdrop of
the Federal Reserve's signals of another rate hike this year and
more in 2019. With rising borrowing costs and prices
outstripping wage growth, the market has been a weak spot in the
robust economy. So new homes sales data, due on Oct. 24, will be
closely scrutinized. 
    U.S. homebuilding dropped more than expected in September,
while mortgage activity was knocked in the latest week to its
lowest since 2014. The housing market has also been hobbled by
an acute shortage of properties for sale and higher home prices.
Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year
and the latest data supports economists' expectations that
housing remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

    4/APPROACHING JUNK 
    Moody's and S&P Global are likely to cut Italy's credit
rating next week to within a notch of 'junk' -- the
sub-investment grade category below BBB-/Baa1 which is usually
populated by the weaker emerging economies.   
    The downgrades will be premised on Italian plans to boost
spending to boost growth and the impact on a debt ratio that's
already one of the world's worst. They would be the culmination
of a nightmare month which has seen Italian borrowing costs
shoot to 4-1/2-year highs as the European Union labelled its
draft budget an ""unprecedented"" breach of fiscal rules. 
    But Italy's debt is already trading with yields that suggest
investors are pricing it as junk already. So the bigger risk
than a one-notch ratings downgrade is that one or both of the
agencies set the outlook on Italy's rating to Negative, instead
of Stable. That would suggest a fall into junk is a real
possibility in the near future. 
    Loss of investment grade carries a high cost -- hundreds of
billions of euros in fund flows and possibly even a fresh euro
zone crisis.

    5/EUROPEAN AUTOS AND BANKS IN BEAR PIT
    European companies' Q3 earnings are a key test for a market
which according to EPFR Global, has seen investors pull out
almost $5 billion this week. Investors are jumpy about China's
economy, rising costs, trade wars, and lacklustre euro zone
growth.   
    The coming week sees Europe's most hated sectors -- autos
and banks -- reporting earnings. French carmakers Renault and
Peugeot will report figures. Coming after Daimler's profit
warning and negative outlooks from tyre maker Michelin and car
dealership Inchcape, these will be watched for signs of strain
from weaker car demand and higher trade tariffs.
    Results from UBS, Barclays, Nordea and the struggling
Deutsche Bank will give a read on how bad things are for the
banking sector.
    Analysts have slashed earnings forecasts for carmakers
consistently over the past six months – and have become 
increasingly pessimistic on banks' earnings since March. Shares
in both sectors are in bear territory, having fallen around 20
percent this year. 
    Earnings for MSCI Europe companies are seen growing more in
2019 than 2018, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows. And while earnings
expectations were relatively stable in 2017, pessimism over
Europe this year has led analysts to steadily downgrade their
forecasts.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker Daimler

    RUSH RELEASE
    Daimler rushed out the release of third-quarter earnings
figures expected next week that it said fell well short of
market expectations.
    The profit warning comes amid friction between the German
government and carmakers over how to avert city bans on
polluting older diesel cars, and an ongoing probe by U.S.
authorities into emissions. 
    The Stuttgart-based company also reported lower unit sales
from its vans division due to delivery delays; and the need to
recognise costs related to a European Court of Justice ruling on
vehicles using an old coolant.
    Daimler said its third-quarter earnings before interest
amounted to 2.49 billion euros ($2.85 billion), down 27 percent
from 3.41 billion in the year-earlier period due to a 35 percent
EBIT fall at Mercedes-Benz Cars to 1.37 billion euros.

 (Adds Venice Commission's opinion)
    By Luiza Ilie
    BUCHAREST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A power struggle between
Romania's government and judiciary is reaching a tipping point
that risks driving a new wedge between the European Union and
its eastern members over democratic standards.
    Justice Minister Tudorel Toader has said he will soon decide
the future of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in
an anti-corruption drive which has won praise from Brussels for
exposing high-level graft, including the theft of EU funds.
    Augustin Lazar oversees around 2,500 prosecutors, including
anti-organised crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA.
    If Toader decides to trigger Lazar's dismissal, it will mark
the end of an era for Romania's prosecutors. The head of the DNA
has already been fired and DIICOT leader's mandate has expired.
    The government says the units have ruined innocent lives.
    Anti-corruption prosecutors have secured almost 5,000
convictions over the past five years, including 27 lawmakers and
83 mayors across parties, as well as ministers, county council
heads, state firm managers and magistrates.    
    Among them is Liviu Dragnea, leader of the ruling Social
Democrats, who was barred from becoming prime minister by a
conviction in the first of three investigations against him. He
denies all wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political
witch-hunt by the judiciary.
    In recent months, his party has launched a slew of bills to
overhaul criminal law and procedures to raise the burden of
proof. It has also set up a unit to investigate judges and
prosecutors for possible crimes and aims to reorganise judges
panels.
    European diplomats, who are seeking sanctions against fellow
east European states Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic
values, are concerned Romania is following suit.
    
    ""MOVING BACKWARDS""
    ""There is now the real risk that things are moving backwards
in a way that would be damaging not only for Romanian democracy
but for the place that it has built as an EU member state,"" the
EU executive's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said at a
meeting of the European Parliament this month.
    ""The procedure that has been started recently in relation to
the general prosecutor raises similarly worrying concerns.""
    An EU advisory body for constitutional rights, the Venice
Commission, said on Friday that changes made to Romania's
criminal code and procedures ""seriously weaken the effectiveness
of its criminal justice system to fight corruption offences,
violent crimes and organised criminality."" 
    Any punitive measures against Romania similar to those the
EU is seeking for Hungary and Poland will depend on the outcome
of the wider legal changes the Social Democrats have initiated,
including in the criminal code.
    On Monday, the government tightened hiring criteria for DNA
and DIICOT prosecutors via an emergency decree; as a result,
over 40 of those prosecutors will be reassigned to other work.
It said this was to address the Venice Commission's concerns.
    Dragnea and senior party members say they aim to curb abuses
by prosecutors and secret services, invoking the spectre of a
""parallel state"" that illegally wiretaps them.

assessment by the justice minister similar to the one Lazar is
undergoing now, despite resistance from the judicial watchdog
and the president. [nL5N1T14PC]
    Other prosecutors and judges have had inspectors in their
offices looking for flaws in their work.
    ""There is a tactic of making examples out of high profile
legal professionals,"" one anti-corruption prosecutor told
Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect pending cases. 
    ""They're trying to show what happens if you don't behave.
And it is working. Some people in the judiciary are starting to
think, why I am fighting this?""
    Minister Toader triggered the evaluation of Lazar, who
oversees the prosecution service, or public ministry, in late
August, saying the decision did not come out of the blue.
    ""Over time, I have noticed how the public ministry has
veered away from its constitutional role of guaranteeing
citizens’ rights and liberties,"" he said. ""As before (with
Kovesi), I will make a radiograph of the prosecutor general’s
management and I will reach a conclusion.""
    The minister told private television station Antena3 earlier
this week his conclusion was days away.
    Lazar, who was appointed three years ago and has accused the
government of trying to politicise the judiciary, said
prosecutors' work was transparent and he did not fear being
dismissed.
    ""It is unfortunately a very sensitive time for the Romanian
judiciary and rule of law,"" he told a conference after the
minister's announcement, the only time he addressed the issue.
    ""It's a context in which manipulating public opinion is
often used as an instrument to destabilise prosecutors' work.""
    The prosecutor general is in charge of requests to lift the
immunity of lawmakers for investigations and has a vote on the
country's judicial watchdog.
    Some critics have said he has not been aggressive enough in
cleaning up the ranks of corrupt or inefficient colleagues, but
many prosecutors admire him for standing up for them.
    DNA statements show the bulk of its anti-corruption cases
concern public works contracts given to firms which courts later
found to be paying bribes; many were overpriced and some
payments, including with EU funds, were made for fictitious
works.
    Timmermans said any changes that would weaken oversight of
how EU taxpayers' money was spent in Romania ""will trigger an
immediate response from the Commission.""
    Investors' associations have repeatedly warned that
corruption is a strong deterrent for business.
    Dragnea, who is also lower house speaker, was given a
two-year suspended sentence in a vote rigging case and also
sentenced to three and a half years in jail for helping keep two
party employees on the payroll of the state child protection
agency. He has appealed and is due in court on Nov 5.[L8N1TN5FJ]
    He is also under investigation in a third case on suspicion
of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state
projects, some of them EU-funded, charges he denies.

    CHECKS AND BALANCES
    Romania's centrist president was forced to sign the Social
Democrats' overhaul of the judiciary into law this month after
he used up his chances to object. It removes his veto rights on
appointing top prosecutors, one of the key checks and balances.
    Toader's nominee to replace Kovesi at the head of
anti-corruption unit DNA has raised concerns she might be soft
on high-level crime.[nL8N1WO3H3]
    In August, riot police fired tear gas into the crowd at an
anti-government rally and beat protesters holding their hands
up. [nL5N1V164B]
    An existing judicial inspectorate, whose chief Toader has
kept on after his mandate expired, has been investigating
magistrates at a rapid pace. Many of those probed have
criticized the legislative changes.
    U.S. ambassador Hans Klemm told law students this month the
judicial overhaul ""creates greater opportunities to coerce and
punish troublesome magistrates.""    
    ""Cloaked in the mantle of concern for due process and human
rights, some of these changes are a clear attempt to protect
vested interests from an independent judiciary,"" he said.
    The ruling party does not always succeed. This month, the
Constitutional Court struck down most of alterations to criminal
procedures that were challenged and which would have raised the
burden of proof on all criminal investigations.
    The Court will discuss challenges brought against proposed
changes to the criminal code on Oct. 24. [nL8N1U03H8]
    The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives aim
to align legislation with EU norms and address abuses, citing
acquittals by higher courts, although these are rare, and
corruption investigations against some prosecutors.
    Dragnea has also said that Romania's Secret Service (SRI),
which has been gathering wiretap evidence for prosecutors based
on court warrants, has been abusing its powers, faking evidence
and illegally intercepting ""millions of Romanians.""
    He said either parliament or government should pass a bill
to retroactively cancel wiretap evidence. That would jeopardise
hundreds of verdicts ranging from corruption to human
trafficking and potentially Dragnea's cases as well.
    DNA said that just over 36,000 people, not millions, have
been wire-tapped since 2005.
    ""When the dust settles,"" the anti-corruption prosecutor
said, ""it will take years to figure out how these laws were
changed and what is left.""

    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The European Union's top court
ordered Poland on Friday to suspend a law forcing some of
country's Supreme Court judges into early retirement, and
reinstate those who have already been dismissed.
    The injunction, issued by the European Court of Justice,
marks a new phase in an investigation by EU authorities into a
political reforms in Warsaw that Brussels argues are undermining
democracy and judicial independence.
    Poland's governing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party,
which has ignored a series of EU warnings to backtrack on the
reforms, pushed through the court law, effectively allowing it
to hand-pick the country's top judges law from July.
    The law lowers the retirement age of judges to 65 from 70. 
Since its implementation, over 20 Supreme Court judges -- around
one-third of the total -- have been forced to quit. 
    In its interim ruling in a case brought by the Commission,
the ECJ told Poland to ""immediately"" suspend application of the
law, adding the order applied retroactively ""to the judges of
the Supreme Court concerned by those provisions.""
    A final judgment will come at a later date, the ECJ said.
    Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the
government would review the court's order.
    ""I can say that certainly after thorough analysis we will
take a position,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of an
EU-Asia summit in Brussels.
    The EU investigation, brought under article 7 of the bloc's
treaty, could in theory lead to Poland losing voting rights in
the bloc.
    But in practice any concrete penalty is unlikely as that
would require unanimity among EU governments. Hungary, itself
under an article 7 investigation, has repeatedly said it would
not back any sanctions against Poland.

 (Adds analyst note, statement from Stuttgart prosecutor's
office)
    By Edward Taylor
    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - German carmaker Daimler AG
<DAIGn.DE> said its operating profit would fall by over 10
percent this year, its second earnings warning since June,
blaming ""government proceedings and measures in various regions""
as a crackdown on diesel emissions takes a toll.
    Daimler warned investors it expected its full-year earnings
before interest and tax to be ""significantly below"" last year's
level. Earnings at Mercedes-Benz Cars, its main contributor,
will likewise fall ""significantly below"" the prior-year level.
    Analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note that the profit
warning was not triggered by a slowdown in business, since
demand for Mercedes-Benz cars remains high, but was caused by
one-off factors such as regulatory and court rulings.
    The company did not gives details on what was behind the
latest warning in a statement rushed out ahead of the scheduled
release of quarterly earnings next week. 
    A hit of up to 400 million euros ($460 million) was related
to government proceedings into diesel and a European Court of
Justice ruling around Mercedes' use of banned cooling agent
R134a, analysts at Evercore ISI said.
    The Stuttgart-based owner of Mercedes-Benz is being
investigated for its diesel emissions in Europe and the United
States, and last month announced Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche
would step down in 2019 to become chairman from 2021.
[nL8N1WC1NB]
    The company's shares fell to a five-year low on the news,
dragging other European auto stocks lower, before paring some of
the losses. The European auto sector index <.SXAP> fell 3.8
percent to a two-year low.
    The warning from Daimler came after economic growth in
China, a major market for carmakers, slowed to its weakest
quarterly pace since 2009. [nL3N1WZ25R]
    Adding to concerns about the broader sector, Swedish
truckmaker Volvo <VOLVb.ST> forecast slower demand for trucks in
Europe and China next year, while French tyre maker Michelin
<MICP.PA> cut its full-year market forecasts on Thursday.
[nL8N1WZ0RP][nL8N1WY6Q5]
    
    RUSH RELEASE
    Daimler rushed out the release of third-quarter earnings
figures that fell well short of market expectations.
    The profit warning comes amid friction between the German
government and carmakers over who pays for expensive retrofits
of new exhaust systems for polluting older vehicles, and an
ongoing probe by U.S. authorities into emissions. 
    In May, German prosecutors searched Daimler offices as part
of a fraud probe related into possible manipulation of
exhaust-gas after-treatment in diesel cars. A spokesman for the
Stuttgart prosecutor's office on Friday said there was ""nothing
new"" to say about this investigation, which is ongoing.
    In February 2016 the United States Environmental Protection
Agency asked Mercedes-Benz to explain emissions levels in some
of its diesel cars. [nL8N1Q91CV]
    The Stuttgart-based company also reported lower unit sales
from its vans division due to delivery delays; and the need to
recognise costs related to a European Court of Justice ruling on
vehicles using an old coolant.
    Daimler said its third-quarter earnings before interest
amounted to 2.49 billion euros ($2.85 billion), down 27 percent
from 3.41 billion in the year-earlier period due to a 35 percent
EBIT fall at Mercedes-Benz Cars to 1.37 billion euros.

    BUCHAREST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A power struggle between

    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mark Zuckerberg
likes Nick Clegg. The former UK deputy prime minister will lead
global affairs and communications at the $450 billion Facebook
<FB.O>. Clegg’s anti-Brexit stance and European Union background
could help tackle mounting troubles in Brussels. But he’s an odd
choice to deal with the social network’s rumbling problems in
Washington.
    A potential fine of up to $1.6 billion over a data breach is
just the latest headache for Facebook across the Atlantic. More
broadly, European regulators are examining closely whether tech
and social-media giants like Facebook are harming competition –
and if so, what to do about it.
    Clegg has pro-Europe chops, as a vocal opponent of Britain
leaving the EU and a former commission official and member of
the European parliament. It doesn’t hurt that he speaks German,
French, Dutch and Spanish. That makes him a useful weapon for
that battle.
    Yet Facebook needs to fight on a second front, too. A recent
hack that affected 30 million Facebook accounts gave the U.S.
Congress another reason to hold hearings. Zuckerberg, the chief
executive, and his deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, had to testify this
year to discuss how Facebook’s platform was misused during the
2016 presidential campaign. Republicans are angry about alleged
bias, while agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice are probing the company, too.
    The scrutiny will surely intensify if the Democrats take
control of the House of Representatives in November’s midterm
elections. In addition to bills enhancing consumer privacy that
would affect Zuckerberg’s firm, the party is also considering
ways to strengthen antitrust measures. The Freedom From Facebook
campaign, backed by liberal groups, is urging policymakers to
break up the company.
    While Facebook has Joel Kaplan, former White House deputy
chief of staff, leading its D.C. presence, it’s still not clear
the Silicon Valley head office fully understands how far its
political star has fallen. Clegg, who will be Kaplan’s boss,
said in a post that Facebook is at the heart of complex social
issues, even the integrity of the democratic process. It’s an
honest assessment. Whether that will help him navigate
Washington’s lobbying and lawmaking machines successfully on
Facebook’s behalf is another question.

    CONTEXT NEWS 
    - Facebook said on Oct. 19 it had hired Nick Clegg, the
former UK deputy prime minister, as vice president of global
affairs and communications. Clegg replaces Elliot Schrage, who
in June said he would leave Facebook. Clegg will move to
California next year.
    - “Our company is on a critical journey,” Chief Operating
Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a Facebook post. “The
challenges we face are serious and clear and now more than ever
we need new perspectives to help us though this time of change
... His experience and ability to work through complex issues
will be invaluable in the years to come.”
    - In a Facebook post, Clegg said he has been talking to
Sandberg and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over the last few
months about joining the firm. “I have been struck by their
recognition that the company is on a journey which brings new
responsibilities not only to the users of Facebook’s apps but to
society at large,” he said. “I hope I will be able to play a
role in helping to navigate that journey.”

    BRUSSELS/WARSAW, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Poland will appeal
against an order by the European Union's top court to suspend an
overhaul of the country's Supreme Court and reinstate judges
forced into early retirement, the head of the ruling party in
Warsaw said on Friday.
    The injunction issued by the European Court of Justice
carries no right of appeal.
    But Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is also Poland's de facto
leader, told a meeting of his Law and Justice (PiS) party: ""We
will observe the EU law, but ... we have the right to appeal.
this is an initial decision and we will appeal.
    ""...We signed treaties, we will be observing them, but we
will also defend our interests.""
    The ECJ order marks a new phase in a broader investigation
by EU authorities into political reforms in Warsaw that Brussels
argues are undermining democracy and judicial independence.
    PiS, which has ignored a series of EU warnings to backtrack
on the reforms, pushed through the supreme court law in July,
effectively allowing it to hand-pick the country's top judges.
    The law lowers the retirement age of judges to 65 from 70. 
Since its implementation, over 20 Supreme Court judges -- around
one-third of the total -- have been forced to quit.
    They include the court's chief justice, Malgorzata Gersdorf,
who argues that she remains in that role under the constitution.
She said she was ""satisfied"" with the ECJ ruling.
    The Polish government says changes in the judiciary system
are needed to improve the efficiency of the courts and rid the
country of a residue of Communism, which collapsed in Poland
almost 30 years ago. 
    In its interim ruling in a case brought by the European
Commission, the ECJ told Poland to ""immediately"" suspend
application of the law, adding the order applied retroactively
""to the judges of the Supreme Court concerned by those
provisions.""
    A final judgment will come at a later date, the ECJ said.
    The EU investigation, brought under article 7 of the bloc's
treaty, could in theory lead to Poland losing voting rights in
the bloc.
    But in practice any concrete penalty is unlikely as that
would require unanimity among EU governments. Hungary, itself
under an article 7 investigation, has repeatedly said it would
not back any sanctions against Poland.

    By Crispian Balmer and Gavin Jones
    ROME, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The leaders of Italy's ruling
coalition parties accused each other on Friday of misleading
voters over a disputed tax amnesty in their most acrimonious
falling-out since they formed a government in June.
    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has called a cabinet meeting
for Saturday to try to resolve the row over the measure, which
forms part of a free-spending 2019 budget that has led to a
standoff between Rome and EU authorities.
    League leader Matteo Salvini said he was ready to bin the
contested amnesty, but he bristled at 5-Star suggestions someone
in his party had surreptitiously broadened it to offer relief to
financial criminals, including money launderers.
    In a blunt video posted on Facebook, Salvini said 5-Star
leader Luigi Di Maio and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte were both
present at a meeting when the amnesty was fully outlined.
    ""I am beginning to get cross because at that cabinet
meeting, Conte read (the text) and Di Maio wrote (the minutes),""
Salvini said. He nonetheless added: ""I couldn't give a stuff
about this amnesty.""
    Conte's office denied Salvini's account, while Di Maio took
to Facebook to hit back, saying: ""I do not want to pass for a
liar, and I am not even going to let people say I was
distracted.""
    The budget, was approved by the cabinet on Monday, promises
to boost welfare spending, cut the retirement age and hike the
deficit.
    Brussels sent Rome a warning letter about it on Thursday,
the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to EU
rejection of the budget and fines against Italy.
    The letter said the budget appeared to be in ""particularly
serious non-compliance"" with EU rules and its deviation from
targets was ""unprecedented"". It gave Rome until Oct. 22 to
respond.
    While 5-Star has opposed tax amnesties in the past, the
right-wing League, with its traditional voter-base of
self-employed businessmen, has pushed for the measure, arguing
it could raise billions of euros for the cash-strapped treasury.
    The main scheme involved people who have failed to declare
up to 100,000 euros of earnings during the last five years, on
which they will be able to pay a rate of 20 percent.
    The spat broke out when it emerged that in the final draft
to be sent to parliament the 100,000 euros referred to each of a
series of taxes evaded, including in hidden, overseas accounts,
rather than to the overall total. 5-Star said this was
unacceptable and it had been tricked.
    Rome's escalating fight with the Commission over the budget
is also alarming markets. 
    The spread between yields on Italian benchmark government
bonds and the German equivalent widened on Friday to a
5-and-a-half-year high of some 340 basis points before falling
back to just over 300 points late Friday. [nL8N1WZ4XO]
    ""Tomorrow we will meet and sort everything out. Then on
Monday we will work on explaining this budget to Europe,"" Di
Maio said.

France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal and Slovenia on Friday that
their 2019 budget proposals did not meet recommended targets for
cutting longer-term deficit cycles, but Paris played down the
criticism.
    As part of its role to police euro zone budgets and avoid
crises that can threaten the currency area, the Commission sent
letters to the five countries, saying they were not cutting
their structural deficits as deeply as agreed.
    In its letter to the French finance ministry, which was made
public on Friday, the Commission wrote: ""The preliminary
evaluation of the Commission indicates that France's trajectory
does not respect the rhythm of debt reduction in 2019,""
referring to euro zone rules.
    The Commission called on Paris to clarify by Oct. 22.
    Overall, the Commission was unhappy that the five countries
were not cutting their structural deficits by up to 0.6 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP), instead targeting a less
ambitious 0.2 percent of economic output. 
    However, the French treasury said in a statement there was
only a ""minor divergence"" between the Commission's assessment of
the French structural deficit adjustment in 2019.
    The warnings were also mild compared to a similar Commission
letter to Italy earlier this week, in which Brussels warned Rome
against substantially increasing its structural deficit.
    That budget proposal, signed off by Italy's cabinet on
Monday, would hike the deficit at a time when EU regulations say
it should be falling, as well as boosting welfare spending and
cutting the retirement age.
    In the first formal step of a procedure that could lead to
Brussels rejecting the budget and fining Italy, the Commission
sent Rome its warning letter on Thursday. [nL8N1WY213]

    PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The international group that
monitors money-laundering worldwide said on Friday Iran had
until February to complete reforms that would bring it into line
with global norms or face consequences.
    The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force said after a
meeting of its members that it was disappointed that Tehran had
acted on only nine out of 10 of its guidelines despite pledges
to make the grade. It had previously set a deadline of October
to compete all 10 reforms.
    ""We expect Iran to move swiftly to implement the commitments
that it undertook at a high level so long ago,"" said Marshall
Billingslea, the U.S. assistant Treasury Secretary for terrorist
financing, after chairing an FATF meeting.
    ""In line with that, we expect that it will have adopted all
of these measures by February. If by February 2019 Iran has not
yet done so, then we will take further steps,"" he said. 
    In the meantime, the FATF said it had decided to continue
suspending counter-measures, which can go as far as limiting or
even banning transactions with a country.
    Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said he
welcomed the decision to extend the deadline to February, the
state news agency IRNA reported.
    He also criticised the U.S. chairmanship of FATF, saying it
was an attempt to bring Iran back on to the international
money-laundering blacklist, without elaborating.
    Iran's parliament approved some new measures against funding
terrorism earlier this month under pressure to adopt
international standards. But FATF said that it could only
consider fully enacted legislation.
    Members of FATF had already given Tehran until this month to
bring its laws against money-laundering and funding of terrorism
up to its guidelines.
    Otherwise, Iran risked being returned to a blacklist of
non-compliant countries that makes foreign investors and banks
reluctant to deal with it.
    Britain, France and Germany are trying to keep some
financial channels open to Iran after the United States pulled
out of a 2015 nuclear deal in May and re-imposed sanctions.
    Analysts say that inclusion on the FATF's blacklist could
effectively make that all but impossible.

of concern and the situation will not get easier next year when
money will be no longer as easy to obtain from the European
Central Bank, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said.
    ""Italy is in a much better position than Greece, but the
level of debt is indeed worrying,"" Nowotny said in an interview
with Austrian daily Kurier published on Saturday. 
    Italy's public debt stood at more than 130 percent of GDP
last year, the highest in the euro zone after Greece. But the
Italian government is looking to boost spending to engineer
faster economic growth, flouting European Union rules.

    Concerns over the budget plans contributed to an increase in
 the spread between German and Italian benchmark 10-year bonds
to 5-1/2 year highs and later on Friday credit rating agency
Moody's cut the country's sovereign debt rating to one notch
above junk status. [nL3N1WZ5VO]    
    In 2018 and 2019, Rome will have to borrow around 380
billion euros ($438 billion) each on the capital market,
Nowotny, who is also the chief of Austria's central bank, said. 
    ""But someone has to buy these government bonds. And it turns
out that this is only possible at higher interest rates. That in
turn increases the budget deficit.""
    As the ECB's bond purchase programme will end this year, it
is mostly Italian banks buying the bonds, the veteran
policymaker said. ""The interdependence is problematic."" 
    The wrangle over Italy's budget is expected to top the
agenda at the ECB meeting on Thursday.

to leave the single currency and would drop out only if it were
forced to, Italian European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona said
on Saturday in a televised speech.
    The sustainability of Italy's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.7
billion) debt, one of the world's largest, has resurfaced as a
potential problem since a populist government rose to power in
May on promises of higher spending.
    Debt rating agency Moody's on Friday cut Italy's sovereign
debt rating to one notch above junk status because of concerns
over government budget plans. But Moody's also said the outlook
for Italy's rating was now stable. [nL3N1WZ5VO]

that Italy may default on its debt,"" Savona, a eurosceptic
economist, told a business conference in Capri.
    ""There is no chance, as far as Italy and my government are
concerned, that Italy's public debt runs a so-called
redenomination risk, that it may reject the euro. If this event
happens, it will be for reasons outside of the country's will."" 
  
    Savona's appointment as finance minister in the current
government was vetoed by Italy's President Sergio Mattarella who
said it risked propelling the country out of the euro.

    By Luiza Ilie
    BUCHAREST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A power struggle between
Romania's government and judiciary is reaching a tipping point
that risks driving a new wedge between the European Union and
its eastern members over democratic standards.
    Justice Minister Tudorel Toader has said he will soon decide
the future of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in
an anti-corruption drive which has won praise from Brussels for
exposing high-level graft, including the theft of EU funds.
    Augustin Lazar oversees around 2,500 prosecutors, including
anti-organised crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA.
    If Toader decides to trigger Lazar's dismissal, it will mark
the end of an era for Romania's prosecutors. The head of the DNA
has already been fired and DIICOT leader's mandate has expired.
    The government says the units have ruined innocent lives.
    Anti-corruption prosecutors have secured almost 5,000
convictions over the past five years, including 27 lawmakers and
83 mayors across parties, as well as ministers, county council
heads, state firm managers and magistrates.    
    Among them is Liviu Dragnea, leader of the ruling Social
Democrats, who was barred from becoming prime minister by a
conviction in the first of three investigations against him. He
denies all wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political
witch-hunt by the judiciary.
    In recent months, his party has launched a slew of bills to
overhaul criminal law and procedures to raise the burden of
proof. It has also set up a unit to investigate judges and
prosecutors for possible crimes and aims to reorganise judges
panels.
    European diplomats, who are seeking sanctions against fellow
east European states Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic
values, are concerned Romania is following suit.
    
    ""MOVING BACKWARDS""
    ""There is now the real risk that things are moving backwards
in a way that would be damaging not only for Romanian democracy
but for the place that it has built as an EU member state,"" the
EU executive's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said at a
meeting of the European Parliament this month.
    ""The procedure that has been started recently in relation to
the general prosecutor raises similarly worrying concerns.""
    The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body
on constitutional matters, said on Friday that changes made to
Romania's criminal code and procedures ""seriously weaken the
effectiveness of its criminal justice system to fight corruption
offences, violent crimes and organised criminality."" 
    Any punitive measures against Romania similar to those the
EU is seeking for Hungary and Poland will depend on the outcome
of the wider legal changes the Social Democrats have initiated,
including in the criminal code.
    On Monday, the government tightened hiring criteria for DNA
and DIICOT prosecutors via an emergency decree; as a result,
over 40 of those prosecutors will be reassigned to other work.
It said this was to address the Venice Commission's concerns.
    Dragnea and senior party members say they aim to curb abuses
by prosecutors and secret services, invoking the spectre of a
""parallel state"" that illegally wiretaps them.
    DNA chief Laura Codruta Kovesi lost her job in July after an
assessment by the justice minister similar to the one Lazar is
undergoing now, despite resistance from the judicial watchdog
and the president. [nL5N1T14PC]
    Other prosecutors and judges have had inspectors in their
offices looking for flaws in their work.
    ""There is a tactic of making examples out of high profile
legal professionals,"" one anti-corruption prosecutor told
Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect pending cases. 
    ""They're trying to show what happens if you don't behave.
And it is working. Some people in the judiciary are starting to
think, why I am fighting this?""
    Minister Toader triggered the evaluation of Lazar, who
oversees the prosecution service, or public ministry, in late
August, saying the decision did not come out of the blue.
    ""Over time, I have noticed how the public ministry has
veered away from its constitutional role of guaranteeing
citizens’ rights and liberties,"" he said. ""As before (with
Kovesi), I will make a radiograph of the prosecutor general’s
management and I will reach a conclusion.""
    The minister told private television station Antena3 earlier
this week his conclusion was days away.
    Lazar, who was appointed three years ago and has accused the
government of trying to politicise the judiciary, said
prosecutors' work was transparent and he did not fear being
dismissed.
    ""It is unfortunately a very sensitive time for the Romanian
judiciary and rule of law,"" he told a conference after the
minister's announcement, the only time he addressed the issue.
    ""It's a context in which manipulating public opinion is
often used as an instrument to destabilise prosecutors' work.""
    The prosecutor general is in charge of requests to lift the
immunity of lawmakers for investigations and has a vote on the
country's judicial watchdog.
    Some critics have said he has not been aggressive enough in
cleaning up the ranks of corrupt or inefficient colleagues, but
many prosecutors admire him for standing up for them.
    DNA statements show the bulk of its anti-corruption cases
concern public works contracts given to firms which courts later
found to be paying bribes; many were overpriced and some
payments, including with EU funds, were made for fictitious
works.
    Timmermans said any changes that would weaken oversight of
how EU taxpayers' money was spent in Romania ""will trigger an
immediate response from the Commission.""
    Investors' associations have repeatedly warned that
corruption is a strong deterrent for business.
    Dragnea, who is also lower house speaker, was given a
two-year suspended sentence in a vote rigging case and also
sentenced to three and a half years in jail for helping keep two
party employees on the payroll of the state child protection
agency. He has appealed and is due in court on Nov 5.[L8N1TN5FJ]
    He is also under investigation in a third case on suspicion
of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state
projects, some of them EU-funded, charges he denies.
[nL8N1NJ33T]
        
    CHECKS AND BALANCES
    Romania's centrist president was forced to sign the Social
Democrats' overhaul of the judiciary into law this month after
he used up his chances to object. It removes his veto rights on
appointing top prosecutors, one of the key checks and balances.
    Toader's nominee to replace Kovesi at the head of
anti-corruption unit DNA has raised concerns she might be soft
on high-level crime.[nL8N1WO3H3]
    In August, riot police fired tear gas into the crowd at an
anti-government rally and beat protesters holding their hands
up. [nL5N1V164B]
    An existing judicial inspectorate, whose chief Toader has
kept on after his mandate expired, has been investigating
magistrates at a rapid pace. Many of those probed have
criticized the legislative changes.
    U.S. ambassador Hans Klemm told law students this month the
judicial overhaul ""creates greater opportunities to coerce and
punish troublesome magistrates.""    
    ""Cloaked in the mantle of concern for due process and human
rights, some of these changes are a clear attempt to protect
vested interests from an independent judiciary,"" he said.
    The ruling party does not always succeed. This month, the
Constitutional Court struck down most of alterations to criminal
procedures that were challenged and which would have raised the
burden of proof on all criminal investigations.
    The Court will discuss challenges brought against proposed
changes to the criminal code on Oct. 24. [nL8N1U03H8]
    The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives aim
to align legislation with EU norms and address abuses, citing
acquittals by higher courts, although these are rare, and
corruption investigations against some prosecutors.
    Dragnea has also said that Romania's Secret Service (SRI),
which has been gathering wiretap evidence for prosecutors based
on court warrants, has been abusing its powers, faking evidence
and illegally intercepting ""millions of Romanians.""
    He said either parliament or government should pass a bill
to retroactively cancel wiretap evidence. That would jeopardise
hundreds of verdicts ranging from corruption to human
trafficking and potentially Dragnea's cases as well.
    DNA said that just over 36,000 people, not millions, have
been wire-tapped since 2005.
    ""When the dust settles,"" the anti-corruption prosecutor
said, ""it will take years to figure out how these laws were
changed and what is left.""

    BERLIN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Germany should not approve arms
sales to Saudi Arabia until investigations into the
circumstances of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death have been
completed, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Saturday.
    Maas's statement, which appeared to reverse a decision to
sell artillery systems to Riyadh, came after he and Chancellor
Angela Merkel rejected as unsatisfactory Saudi Arabia's
explanation for the death of the dissident journalist in its
Istanbul consulate.
    In an interview for public television's Tagesthemen
programme, Maas said he believed no weapons should be sold to
the kingdom until the circumstances of Khashoggi's death had
been cleared up.
    ""As long as investigations are underway, as long as we don't
know what happened there, there is no reason to take positive
decisions on arms exports to Saudi Arabia,"" he said.
    The decision last month to authorise the sale, part of an
effort to normalise relations with the kingdom, stirred
controversy because it ran against an earlier pledge not to sell
arms to countries involved in the Yemen war. [nL8N1W55PE]
    In the strongest Western reaction to Riyadh's admission that
Khashoggi had died in the consulate, Merkel and Maas earlier
condemned the killing, demanding that Riyadh make clear what had
happened.
    ""We condemn this act in the strongest terms,"" read a joint
statement, in which they demanded ""transparency"" from Riyadh.
""The information available about events in the Istanbul
consulate is inadequate.""
    Expressing deep sympathy to Khashoggi's friends and
relatives, Merkel and Maas said those responsible for his death
must be held accountable.
    Asked in the interview whether Siemens <SIEGn.DE> boss Joe
Kaeser should follow many other international executives in
cancelling plans to attend a forthoming investment conference in
Saudi Arabia, Maas said cancellations sent the right signal.
    ""I certainly wouldn't participate in an event in Riyadh at
the moment,"" he said. ""And I have great understanding for those
who have cancelled.""
    In his interview, Maas added that a United Nations-backed
probe of the killing might be a means of improving the
""objectivity and credibility"" of any findings.
    Merkel's and Maas's remarks followed calls from across the
political spectrum on Saturday for Germany to toughen its stance
 towards Riyadh following the drama around Khashoggi which comes
at an awkward time for Berlin, which has been attempting to
normalise its stormy relations with the kingdom.

    * Minister's review of prosecutor general near the end
    * Government changes hiring rules for prosecutors via decree
    * Diplomats say legal changes interfere with judicial
independence
    * Ruling party says changes aim to correct abuses

    By Luiza Ilie
    BUCHAREST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A power struggle between
Romania's government and judiciary is reaching a tipping point
that risks driving a new wedge between the European Union and
its eastern members over democratic standards.
    Justice Minister Tudorel Toader has said he will soon decide
the future of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in
an anti-corruption drive which has won praise from Brussels for
exposing high-level graft, including the theft of EU funds.
    Augustin Lazar oversees around 2,500 prosecutors, including
anti-organised crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA.
    If Toader decides to trigger Lazar's dismissal, it will mark
the end of an era for Romania's prosecutors. The head of the DNA
has already been fired and DIICOT leader's mandate has expired.
    The government says the units have ruined innocent lives.
    Anti-corruption prosecutors have secured almost 5,000
convictions over the past five years, including 27 lawmakers and
83 mayors across parties, as well as ministers, county council
heads, state firm managers and magistrates.    
    Among them is Liviu Dragnea, leader of the ruling Social
Democrats, who was barred from becoming prime minister by a
conviction in the first of three investigations against him. He
denies all wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political
witch-hunt by the judiciary.
    In recent months, his party has launched a slew of bills to
overhaul criminal law and procedures to raise the burden of
proof. It has also set up a unit to investigate judges and
prosecutors for possible crimes and aims to reorganise judges'
panels.
    European diplomats, who are seeking sanctions against fellow
east European states Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic
values, are concerned Romania is following suit.
    
    ""MOVING BACKWARDS""
    ""There is now the real risk that things are moving backwards
in a way that would be damaging not only for Romanian democracy
but for the place that it has built as an EU member state,"" the
EU executive's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said at a
meeting of the European Parliament this month.
    ""The procedure that has been started recently in relation to
the general prosecutor raises similarly worrying concerns.""
    The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body
on constitutional matters, said on Friday that changes made to
Romania's criminal code and procedures ""seriously weaken the
effectiveness of its criminal justice system to fight corruption
offences, violent crimes and organised criminality"".
    Any punitive measures against Romania similar to those the
EU is seeking for Hungary and Poland will depend on the outcome
of the wider legal changes the Social Democrats have initiated,
including in the criminal code.
    On Monday, the government tightened hiring criteria for DNA
and DIICOT prosecutors via an emergency decree; as a result,
over 40 of those prosecutors will be reassigned to other work.
It said this was to address the Venice Commission's concerns.
    Dragnea and senior party members say they aim to curb abuses
by prosecutors and secret services, invoking the spectre of a
""parallel state"" that illegally wiretaps them.
    DNA chief Laura Codruta Kovesi lost her job in July after an
assessment by the justice minister similar to the one Lazar is
undergoing now, despite resistance from the judicial watchdog
and the president. [nL5N1T14PC]
    Other prosecutors and judges have had inspectors in their
offices looking for flaws in their work.
    ""There is a tactic of making examples out of high profile
legal professionals,"" one anti-corruption prosecutor told
Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect pending cases. 
    ""They're trying to show what happens if you don't behave.
And it is working. Some people in the judiciary are starting to
think, why I am fighting this?""
    Minister Toader triggered the evaluation of Lazar, who
oversees the prosecution service, or public ministry, in late
August, saying the decision did not come out of the blue.
    ""Over time, I have noticed how the public ministry has
veered away from its constitutional role of guaranteeing
citizens’ rights and liberties,"" he said. ""As before (with
Kovesi), I will make a radiograph of the prosecutor general’s
management and I will reach a conclusion.""
    The minister told private television station Antena3 earlier
this week his conclusion was days away.
    Lazar, who was appointed three years ago and has accused the
government of trying to politicise the judiciary, said
prosecutors' work was transparent and he did not fear being
dismissed.
    ""It is unfortunately a very sensitive time for the Romanian
judiciary and rule of law,"" he told a conference after the
minister's announcement, the only time he addressed the issue.
    ""It's a context in which manipulating public opinion is
often used as an instrument to destabilise prosecutors' work.""
    The prosecutor general is in charge of requests to lift the
immunity of lawmakers for investigations and has a vote on the
country's judicial watchdog.
    Some critics have said he has not been aggressive enough in
cleaning up the ranks of corrupt or inefficient colleagues, but
many prosecutors admire him for standing up for them.
    DNA statements show the bulk of its anti-corruption cases
concern public works contracts given to firms which courts later
found to be paying bribes; many were overpriced and some
payments, including with EU funds, were made for fictitious
works.
    Timmermans said any changes that would weaken oversight of
how EU taxpayers' money was spent in Romania ""will trigger an
immediate response from the Commission.""
    Investors' associations have repeatedly warned that
corruption is a strong deterrent for business.
    Dragnea, who is also lower house speaker, was given a
two-year suspended sentence in a vote rigging case and also
sentenced to three and a half years in jail for helping keep two
party employees on the payroll of the state child protection
agency. He has appealed and is due in court on Nov
5.[nL8N1TN5FJ]
    He is also under investigation in a third case on suspicion
of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state
projects, some of them EU-funded, charges he denies.
[nL8N1NJ33T]
        
    CHECKS AND BALANCES
    Romania's centrist president was forced to sign the Social
Democrats' overhaul of the judiciary into law this month after
he used up his chances to object. It removes his veto rights on
appointing top prosecutors, one of the key checks and balances.
    Toader's nominee to replace Kovesi at the head of
anti-corruption unit DNA has raised concerns she might be soft
on high-level crime.[nL8N1WO3H3]
    In August, riot police fired tear gas into the crowd at an
anti-government rally and beat protesters holding their hands
up. [nL5N1V164B]
    An existing judicial inspectorate, whose chief Toader has
kept on after his mandate expired, has been investigating
magistrates at a rapid pace. Many of those probed have
criticized the legislative changes.
    U.S. ambassador Hans Klemm told law students this month the
judicial overhaul ""creates greater opportunities to coerce and
punish troublesome magistrates.""    
    ""Cloaked in the mantle of concern for due process and human
rights, some of these changes are a clear attempt to protect
vested interests from an independent judiciary,"" he said.
    The ruling party does not always succeed. This month, the
Constitutional Court struck down most of alterations to criminal
procedures that were challenged and which would have raised the
burden of proof on all criminal investigations.
    The Court will discuss challenges brought against proposed
changes to the criminal code on Oct. 24. [nL8N1U03H8]
    The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives aim
to align legislation with EU norms and address abuses, citing
acquittals by higher courts, although these are rare, and
corruption investigations against some prosecutors.
    Dragnea has also said that Romania's Secret Service (SRI),
which has been gathering wiretap evidence for prosecutors based
on court warrants, has been abusing its powers, faking evidence
and illegally intercepting ""millions of Romanians.""
    He said either parliament or government should pass a bill
to retroactively cancel wiretap evidence. That would jeopardise
hundreds of verdicts ranging from corruption to human
trafficking and potentially Dragnea's cases as well.
    DNA said that just over 36,000 people, not millions, have
been wire-tapped since 2005.
    ""When the dust settles,"" the anti-corruption prosecutor
said, ""it will take years to figure out how these laws were
changed and what is left.""

    MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and
Five-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said on Sunday he was committed
to preserving the country's membership of the euro zone.
    Rome's anti-establishment government is striving to reassure
investors after a draft 2019 budget driving the deficit higher
prompted a market sell-off and sent the risk premium that
Italian bonds pay over safer German paper to a 5-1/2 year high
of 3.4 percentage points.
    ""We understood from conversations with people from the ECB
(European Central Bank) and the markets, meaning investors, that
the (bond yield spread) jumped because there is a concern that
this government wants to leave the euro or the European Union,""
Di Maio told RAI state television.
    ""I want to say it here, and there will be other solemn
occasions to reiterate it as a government and a political party,
... there is no Plan B (to leave Europe) but only Plan A which
is to change Europe,"" Di Maio said.
    ""As long as I'm head of this movement and a minister of this
government I'll always guarantee that Italy remains within the
euro and in Europe,"" he added.
    The ECB declined to comment on Di Maio's remark about
conversations with people from the central bank.
    Euro break-up fears have resurfaced since a coalition
comprising the anti-establishment 5-Star and the eurosceptic
League party came to power in Italy in May. Foreign investors
have shed 67 billion euros ($77 billion) in Italian government
bonds since then.
    Faced with a spike in debt costs which is undermining the
country's banks and could risk choking off the economy, the Rome
government has sought to strike a more conciliatory tone over
the budget but it has so far stopped short of saying it may
revise down next year's deficit goal.
    A government source told Reuters Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Foreign Minister Enzo
Moavero Milanesi had unsuccessfully pushed for a reduction of
the deficit target at a cabinet meeting on Saturday.
    Di Maio said the government was preparing a letter in reply
to the EU Commission's criticism of the budget which would be
sent on Monday with the Commission expected to react shortly
after that.
    ""I hope the explanations we will provide over a long
discussion process ... could lead the Commission to share the
goals we have set,"" he said.
    The Commission has labelled Rome's plan to lift the budget
deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output next year from 1.8
percent in 2018 an unprecedented breach of EU fiscal rules.
    Credit rating agency Moody's on Friday downgraded Italy's
debt to one notch above junk status citing concerns over the
government's budget plans.
    Di Maio said he hoped the Commission would take into account
in its assessment Italy's strengths such as the private sector's
low debt and high household wealth, which Moody's cited among
reasons supporting a 'stable' outlook on the rating.
    He denied however the government was considering a wealth
tax to help reduce Italy's 2.3 trillion euro public debt.
    After riding popular anger at the austerity measures Italy
adopted in response to the euro zone crisis of 2011-2012, the
League and the 5 Star want to lower the retirement age and
provide a basic income for the poor. 
    Di Maio said Italy had a chance to prove public debt could
be reduced by ""investing in social rights"" and trigger important
changes across Europe.
    Di Maio said the 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo,
was working to present in January-February a programme that
brought together similar grassroots movements from other
European countries with the goal to ""give back a heart and
humanity to European institutions.""

    By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
    MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The Italian government expects the
European Commission to decide for the first time ever on Tuesday
to ask a member state to revise its draft budget, a government
source said on Sunday.
    The Commission has slammed as an unprecedented breach of EU
fiscal rules Italy's 2019 budget plan, which aims to lift the
deficit to 2.4 percent of domestic output next year from 1.8
percent in 2018.
    Since receiving beefed-up powers in 2013 over member states'
budgetary plans, the Commission has never asked a country to
submit a revised budget.
    Italy's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.65 trillion) public debt, one
of the world's largest, makes the country vulnerable and a
potential source of contagion for other euro zone countries.
    Investors have shed 67 billion euros in Italian bonds since
a populist government formed in May, sending the risk premium
Italy pays over safer German paper to a 5-1/2 year high of 3.4
percentage points. 
    The source said Economy Minister Giovanni Tria and Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte had unsuccessfully pushed for a
reduction of the 2019 deficit target at a cabinet meeting on
Saturday.
    The source did not rule out an agreement to lower the
deficit goal could be found during a three-week period of
negotiations with Brussels that will follow the rejection.
    Though the decision was expected on Tuesday, the source said
it may not be announced on the same day.
    Asked for comment, a Commission spokesman said that the
Commission had expressed its ""serious concerns"" over the draft
budget to the Italian authorities, seeking clarifications by
noon on Monday to facilitate an assessment.
    Earlier on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said
the government was working on the letter it would send to the
Commission on Monday, adding he expected a speedy reaction.
    Di Maio, who leads the ruling anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement, told RAI state television he hoped the explanations
Rome would provide ""over a long discussion process ... could
lead the Commission to share the goals we have set.""
    After riding popular anger at the austerity measures Italy
adopted in response to the euro zone crisis of 2011-2012,
Italy's ruling coalition, also comprising the far-right League,
wants to lower the retirement age and provide a basic income for
the poor.
    On Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Italy's
debt to one notch above junk status citing concerns over the
government's budget plans.
    
    NO PLAN B
    Di Maio said he hoped the Commission would take into account
Italy's strengths such as the private sector's low debt and high
household wealth, which Moody's cited among reasons supporting a
'stable' outlook on the rating.
    He joined other government members in efforts to dispel
concerns about Italy's euro membership.    
    ""We understood from conversations with people from the ECB
(European Central Bank) and the markets, meaning investors, that
the (bond yield spread) jumped because there is a concern that
this government wants to leave the euro or the European Union,""
Di Maio said.
    ""I want to say it here, and there will be other solemn
occasions to reiterate it as a government and a political party,
... there is no Plan B (to leave Europe) but only Plan A which
is to change Europe,"" Di Maio said.
    ""As long as I'm head of this movement and a minister of this
government I'll always guarantee that Italy remains within the
euro and in Europe,"" he added.
    The ECB declined to comment on Di Maio's remark about
conversations with people from the central bank.
    Di Maio said Italy had a chance to prove public debt could
be reduced by ""investing in social rights"" and trigger important
changes across Europe.
    He said the 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, was
working to present in January-February a programme that brought
together similar grassroots movements from other European
countries with the goal to ""give back a heart and humanity to
European institutions."" ($1 = 0.8686 euros)

    BERLIN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
campaigning for her Christian Democrats (CDU) to retain control
of the crucial state of Hesse in next Sunday's election,
promised legislation to ward off the threat of air pollution
leading to driving bans.
    Speaking at a news conference on Sunday evening, Merkel said
it would be disproportionate to ban dirty diesel cars from the
road in places like Frankfurt, Hesse's largest city, where
nitrogen emissions limits were only marginally exceeded.
    Following her allies' disastrous showing in Bavaria's
regional elections last week, Merkel faces murmurs of dissent
within her party. Defeat in the state to the resurgent Greens
could prove fatal to her premiership.
    Emissions from diesel cars have pushed nitrogen levels above
the permitted level of 50 milligrams per cubic metre in dozens
of cities across Germany, and Merkel's government is keen to
avoid widldly unpopular bans on taking the cars on the road.
    ""Driving bans are disproportionate when it comes to small
excess pollution levels,"" she said. ""We want to change the law
... That is a very important piece of information for a city
like Frankfurt.""
    The new legislation would enshrine in law that driving bans
were not proportionate in cases of a small excess such as in
Frankfurt, where nitrogen levels stand at 57 microgrammes, since
deployment of cleaner buses and other measures would be
sufficient to rein in pollution levels before 2020.
    Striking a populist note, she placed herself firmly on the
side of consumers when it came to the cost of expensive
retrofitting of vehicles that might be needed in cities where
excess pollution is substantial.
    ""We are on the side of owners of diesel cars and are clear
that they should suffer no financial harm,"" she said. ""We
believe the car industry bears responsibility because it has
massively undermined trust in it.""
    A series of scandals involving schemes to conceal the true
levels of pollutant emissions from diesel cars has dealt
repeated blows to the global reputation of Germany's car
industry in recent years.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Monday as a
fall in Italian government borrowing costs after their recent
surge introduced some calm into the market, while the promise of
more Chinese stimulus helped offset broader political worries. 
    Rating agency Moody's downgraded the Italian government's
credit rating on Friday but unexpectedly kept the outlook at
stable. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    That, together with comments by Deputy Prime Minister Luigi
Di Maio that the government was ready to sit down with the
European Union amid the ongoing row over Rome's budget, boosted
demand for Italian debt after a sharp selloff in recent weeks.
    The euro has often fallen this year when Italian government
bond yields have spiked higher. [nL8N1WZ4VO]
    The single currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.1550 <EUR=>,
hitting the day's high and away from recent lows of $1.1433.
    The dollar index dropped 0.3 percent to 95.472 <.DXY>.
    The euro was also 0.2 percent higher at 1.1487 Swiss francs
<EURCHF=>, and gained 0.2 percent versus sterling to 88.26 pence
<EURGBP=>.
    Despite the euro's rally, analysts said it remained at the
mercy of Italian developments, with a great deal of uncertainty
ahead.
    ""...A full diary of risk events over the next two weeks and
little to argue in favour of support from the ECB (European
Central Bank) in the near future, the question remains over how
far the yield gap can blow out and how this could translate back
into the FX market,"" said Simon Derrick, chief currency
strategist at BNY Mellon.
    Equity markets were largely in positive territory as hopes
that China's tax cuts next year could be worth more than one
percent of gross domestic product sparked a rally in Asian
shares that fed across to Europe. [nL3N1X21KG]
    That helped offset geopolitical concerns about the rift
between Saudi Arabia and the West over the killing of a
prominent critic of the kingdom, as well as worries about
Britain securing an exit deal with the EU.
    Forex markets were largely quiet, although the more positive
tone at the start of the week did buoy sentiment.
    For the dollar, a hawkish Federal Reserve and signs of
continued strength in the U.S. economy remain key drivers. 
    ""Markets will be closely watching the release of the U.S.
advance GDP number on Friday for more clarity on the direction
of the U.S. dollar,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at
Bank of Singapore.
    The dollar rose versus the Japanese yen <JPY=>. The yen
fetched 112.71, down 0.2 percent on the day and off a one-month
high of 111.61 touched on Oct. 15.
    The yen had benefited from rising risk around Brexit, the
Italy budget plan and trade tensions, because investors tend to
buy the Japanese currency when they are nervous.
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> changed hands at 1.3080 on its
U.S. counterpart, within striking distance of a five-week low of
1.3132 hit on Friday on the back of weaker inflation and retail
sales. [nL2N1WY1L4]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=>, often considered a barometer
for global risk appetite, traded at $0.7122, flat on the day.

dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week
and the Reuters stories related to them.
    
    1/SEVEN DEADLY…
    The real possibility of the yuan weakening to the
7-per-dollar mark last seen in 2008, hangs over China, emerging
markets and global equities. The thinking so far has been that
the risk of capital outflows, along the lines of what happened
in 2016, would dissuade Beijing from allowing such a slide in
the currency. But more recently, weak benchmark yuan/dollar
fixings, a drop in the trade-weighted yuan index to below 2017
lows, and a flurry of comments and measures from policymakers
reveal both a sense of panic and determination to prop up the
economy.
    With third-quarter economic growth slowing to crisis-era
lows, no let-up in Washington's trade rhetoric and a stock
market that's lost 28 percent since February, China has been
forced to ease monetary conditions and is cajoling banks to lend
to small firms. It has just announced tax cuts that could reach
one percent of GDP next year.
    A weaker yuan would complement those efforts. Yet a
7-per-dollar yuan would erode faith in the China's stability and
provoke more U.S. ire. And coming on top of rising U.S. yields,
Brexit and Italian politics, it would add another layer of worry
to world markets.

    2/EUROPE'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE        
    Stock market turmoil, conflict over a contentious Italian
budget, high oil prices, sputtering economic growth -- not quite
the backdrop a central bank wants to see three months before its
 it ends its stimulus programme. 
    But that is exactly what the European Central Bank faces
when it meets on Thursday. For now, the heightened risks to the
growth outlook are not expected to derail its plans to end QE by
year-end, but the bank could downgrade the growth risk
assessment in its policy statement.
    That would be a dovish signal and one likely to cheer euro
zone bond markets which have been guided already to not expect a
rise in the ECB's record low rates until well into 2019. No
wonder then, that the gap between short-dated bond yields in the
United States and Germany are at their widest in 30 years, while
10-year euro area bond yields (with the exception of Italy) have
been largely insulated from the recent spike U.S. Treasury
yields.

    3/HOME RUN
    The U.S. housing market, the store of much of Americans'
wealth, has taken a leg down of late, against the backdrop of
the Federal Reserve's signals of another rate hike this year and
more in 2019. With rising borrowing costs and prices
outstripping wage growth, the market has been a weak spot in the
robust economy. So new homes sales data, due on Oct. 24, will be
closely scrutinized. 
    U.S. homebuilding dropped more than expected in September,
while mortgage activity was knocked in the latest week to its
lowest since 2014. The housing market has also been hobbled by
an acute shortage of properties for sale and higher home prices.
Residential investment contracted in the first half of the year
and the latest data supports economists' expectations that
housing remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

    4/APPROACHING JUNK 
    Moody's has just cut Italy's credit rating to within a notch
of 'junk' -- the sub-investment grade category below BBB-/Baa1
which is usually populated by the weaker emerging economies. On
Friday, S&P Global is likely to do the same, premising the move
on Italian plans to boost spending to boost growth and the
impact on a debt ratio that's already one of the world's worst.
    But Italy's debt is trading with yields that suggest
investors are pricing it as junk already. So the bigger risk
than a one-notch ratings downgrade has been that one or both of
the agencies set the outlook on Italy's rating to Negative,
instead of Stable. That would suggest a fall into junk is a real
possibility in the near future.
    Loss of investment grade carries a high cost -- hundreds of
billions of euros in fund flows and possibly even a fresh euro
zone crisis.
    Luckily for Italy, Moody's has held off doing that,
maintaining a steady outlook on the credit and providing a boost
to bonds and stocks. Many will be hoping S&P follows its lead.

    5/EUROPEAN AUTOS AND BANKS IN BEAR PIT
    European companies' Q3 earnings are a key test for a market
which according to EPFR Global, has seen investors pull out
almost $5 billion this week. Investors are jumpy about China's
economy, rising costs, trade wars, and lacklustre euro zone
growth.   
    The coming week sees Europe's most hated sectors -- autos
and banks -- reporting earnings. French carmakers Renault and
Peugeot will report figures. Coming after Daimler's profit
warning and negative outlooks from tyre maker Michelin and car
dealership Inchcape, these will be watched for signs of strain
from weaker car demand and higher trade tariffs.
    Results from UBS, Barclays, Nordea and the struggling
Deutsche Bank will give a read on how bad things are for the
banking sector.
    Analysts have slashed earnings forecasts for carmakers
consistently over the past six months – and have become 
increasingly pessimistic on banks' earnings since March. Shares
in both sectors are in bear territory, having fallen around 20
percent this year. 
    Earnings for MSCI Europe companies are seen growing more in
2019 than 2018, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows. And while earnings
expectations were relatively stable in 2017, pessimism over
Europe this year has led analysts to steadily downgrade their
forecasts.

 (Adds May quotes, background)
    By Elizabeth Piper and Kylie MacLellan
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will
on Monday say that 95 percent of Britain's Brexit deal has been
agreed but repeat her opposition to a European Union proposal
for the Irish border, a major stumbling block, as criticism
within her party grows.
    Facing some of the fiercest attacks to date over her Brexit
plans after again failing to clinch a deal at an EU summit last
week, May will try to calm passions in parliament where her
strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU supporters alike.
    With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to
exit the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the
so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. 
    But May's attempt to unlock the talks by considering an
extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current
proposed end date of December 2020 has further riled both pro-
and anti-EU factions in her deeply split Conservative Party.
    In an attempt to highlight how much progress has been made
in more than a year of talks with the EU, she will tell
parliament the government has reached agreement on everything
from Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks.
    ""Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal
Agreement and its protocols are now settled,"" May will say,
according to excerpts from her statement to parliament.
    ""The shape of the deal across the vast majority of the
Withdrawal Agreement is now clear.""
    But the deal - the terms of Britain's divorce - cannot be
signed off until the two sides settle on future management of
the border between Northern Ireland, a British province, and EU
member state Ireland.
    Both sides are committed to keeping the border open, a key
aspect of a 1998 peace deal that ended decades of Irish
sectarian bloodshed.
    The EU proposal - for Northern Ireland to remain in the
bloc's customs union - has been rejected by May as it would
potentially create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain,
something ruled out by a pro-Brexit Northern Irish party that
props up her minority government.
    At an EU summit in Brussels last week, any agreement seemed
just as far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and
diplomats saying May had offered nothing new to ease the
deadlock. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    Since then, her proposal to extend the transition period has
stoked anger among Conservative eurosceptics, who fear she is
leading Britain into a deal that will make Britain ""vassal
state"" indefinitely - unable ever to fully leave the EU.
    
    NATIONAL INTEREST
    Critics of May used Britain's Sunday newspapers to
rhetorically savage the British leader, with unnamed rivals
using phrases such as ""assassination is in the air"".
    A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48
Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the
party's so-called ""1922 Committee"" of backbenchers demanding
such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent.
    The newspapers reported May had been summoned to address
Conservative lawmakers in a private meeting on Wednesday. The
Daily Telegraph said she had held a 90-minute conference call
with her top ministers on Sunday to try and shore up support.
    On Wednesday one prominent hardline Brexiteer, former junior
Brexit minister Steve Baker, will try to block the EU's backstop
plan by attaching amendments to legislation passing through
parliament that would effectively make the proposal illegal. 
    May used a piece in Monday's Sun newspaper to stress that
the Brexit negotiations were not about her and her future.
    ""When I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit
negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for
me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family
and for the whole of the United Kingdom,"" she wrote.
    ""Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal
fortunes. They’re about the national interest - and that means
making the right choices, not the easy ones.""
    On Sunday, Brexit minister Dominic Raab pushed forward the
suggestion of extending the transition period, saying London
could accept such a move if the EU dropped its proposal for a
backstop without time limit, which May says would tear Northern
Ireland away from mainland Britain. [nL8N1WY1X5]

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The euro failed to hold
early-session gains on Monday as investors focused on the
likelihood of further political uncertainty in Europe over
Italy's spending plans, despite a large drop in Italian
government borrowing costs.
    Rating agency Moody's downgraded the Italian credit rating
on Friday but unexpectedly kept the outlook at stable.
[nL3N1WZ5VO]
    That, along with more conciliatory comments from Italian
officials that they were ready to sit down with European Union
officials and did not intend to expand the deficit beyond 2019,
boosted demand for Italian debt after a weeks-long sell-off.
    But the euro, its fortunes increasingly linked this year to
Italian bond prices, failed to hold on to early gains and
dropped from $1.1550 to $1.1511, down 0.1 percent from the open.
[nL8N1WZ4VO] [nR1N1VZ02J]
    ""We have more conciliatory tones from both sides but it is
still clear that this dispute is not over yet,"" Commerzbank
analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    ""We are expecting volatile markets,"" she said, noting that
investors would be looking to Thursday's European Central Bank
monetary policy meeting to see whether, while unlikely, the bank
would comment on the dispute.
    Other analysts also said the euro remained at the mercy of
Italian developments, with a great deal of uncertainty ahead.
    ""... A full diary of risk events over the next two weeks and
little to argue in favour of support from the ECB in the near
future, the question remains over how far the yield gap can blow
out and how this could translate back into the FX market,"" BNY
Mellon chief currency strategist Simon Derrick said.
    The single currency was able to hold on to gains elsewhere,
rising 0.1 percent to 1.1474 Swiss francs <EURCHF=>, and 0.3
percent versus sterling to 88.300 pence <EURGBP=>.
    The dollar index rose 0.1 percent to 95.782 <.DXY>.
    
    CHINA BOOST
    Equity markets were mostly positive as hopes that China's
tax cuts next year could be worth more than one percent of gross
domestic product sparked a rally in Asian shares that fed across
to Europe. [nL3N1X21KG] [nL3N1X206H]
    That helped offset geopolitical concerns about the rift
between Saudi Arabia and the West over the killing of a
prominent critic of the kingdom, as well as worries about
Britain securing an exit deal with the EU.
    Although the more positive tone at the start of the week did
boost sentiment, forex markets were largely quiet. 
    The Australian dollar, which tends to benefit when China
sentiment improves because of its exposure to Chinese demand,
dropped 0.2 percent to $0.7105 <AUD=>. 
    Elsewhere, the dollar rose versus the Japanese yen <JPY=>.
The yen fetched 112.82, down 0.3 percent on the day and off a
one-month high of 111.61 touched on Oct. 15. Geopolitical
concerns helped it to benefit from its safe-haven status.
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> changed hands at C$1.3087, within
striking distance of a five-week low of C$1.3132 hit on Friday
on the back of weaker inflation and retail sales. [nL2N1WY1L4]
    Sterling traded 0.2 percent lower <GBP=> at $1.3034 as
markets prepared for British Prime Minister Theresa May's latest

    SOFIA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Bulgaria will target a fiscal
deficit of 0.5 percent of economic output next year in
preparation for higher spending on wages, education and defence,
its budget draft showed on Monday.
    After initially targeting a fiscal deficit of 1 percent, the
European Union state is expected to end this year with a 
surplus of 0.5 percent mainly due to stronger-than-expected
revenues, the Finance Ministry draft showed.
    The draft is subject to government and parliamentary
approval.
    Under the plan, the Balkan country, which hopes to enter the
two-year obligatory waiting room for euro zone membership in
2019, plans to balance its budget as of 2020. 
    Bulgaria operates under a currency board regime that
requires its central bank to set interest rates and leaves
fiscal policy as the only tool to influence its economy.
    ""Key goals continue to be maintaining fiscal sustainability
and transparent and predictable fiscal policy,"" the draft said.
    Bulgaria ended 2017 with a fiscal surplus of 1.1 percent of
GDP, after initially targeting a deficit, spurring some
economists to say the finance ministry was lowering its revenue
projections so it could boast it had outperformed its targets.  
    Economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.7 percent
next year from 3.6 percent in 2018, with average annual
inflation rising to 3 percent in 2019.  
    The centre-right government plans to increase spending on  
public salaries by 10 percent, which will translate to a 20
percent hike for teachers' wages. Under the budget draft, state
pensions will also grow by an average of 5.7 percent from July.
    Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov has said he hopes the
private sector will follow suit and thus help boost living
standards in what is the poorest EU member state. [nL5N1VX2AX]  
  
    Sofia also plans to spend more for disabled and
disadvantaged people, and for defence as part of plans to meet a
NATO defence spending target of 2 percent of GDP by 2024 and buy
new aircraft and machinery for the army.

following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

 (Adds comment from Italian PM, Austria, background)
    By Gavin Jones and Giselda Vagnoni
    ROME, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Italy told the European Commission
on Monday it would stick to its contested 2019 budget plans in
defiance of EU fiscal rules, but promised not to inflate its
deficit any further in the years ahead.
    In a letter to the Commission, Economy Minister Giovanni
Tria said he recognised that the budget, which is set to hike
next year's deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), was not in line with the EU Stability and Growth Pact. 
    However, looking to silence growing alarm from EU allies, he
said the government had to respond to years of anaemic growth in
the euro zone's third largest economy.
    ""(The budget) was a hard, but necessary decision in light of
Italy's delay in catching up to pre-crisis levels of GDP and the
desperate economic conditions in which the most disadvantaged
citizens find themselves,"" Tria wrote. 
    The European Commission sent Rome a warning letter about the
budget last week -- the first formal step of a procedure that
could lead to Brussels rejecting the package and imposing fines.
    An EU spokesman said the Commission would decide on Tuesday
its next step. [nB5N1VQ00I] 
    Underscoring the growing tensions, German Finance Minister
Olaf Scholz said Italy had to be ""careful"" over its debt, while
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called on the EU Commission
to reject the budget unless changes were made. [nV9N1U000K]
    Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte dismissed Kurz's
criticism as ""incautious"" and reiterated that Rome wanted to
have ""constructive dialogue"" over the budget, which includes tax
cuts, welfare hikes and a rolling back of tough pension reform.
    
    ""READ MY LIPS""
    In a wide-ranging news conference, Conte also stressed that
his government, which comprises the right-wing League and
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, had no intention of
abandoning either the euro currency or the European Union.
    ""Read my lips. There is no way Italy will leave the euro,""
Conte said. However, he added that the European Union was
damaging itself by not meeting the needs of ordinary people.
    Italy's economy is still some six percent smaller than it
was at the start of 2008, hobbled by a slew of long-standing
problems, including a national debt mountain at around 131
percent of GDP -- the second highest in Europe after Greece.
    Conte predicted that growth would ""take off"" once government
reforms were enacted. To help fund its expansionary programme,
the Treasury sharply hiked the deficit goal from a targeted 1.8
percent this year.
    ""For us, 2.4 percent is the ceiling,"" Conte said. ""As the
budget comes into force, we are ready to contain it. We are not
obliged to reach that figure and we certainly won't exceed it.
    Concerns over the budget have weighed heavily on Italian
government bonds in recent weeks, with the spread between German
and Italian benchmark 10-year paper hitting 5-1/2 year highs on
Friday. 
    However, Italian yields headed on Monday for their biggest
daily drop since June after Moody's held off cutting the
country's credit rating outlook to negative.
    Moody's downgraded Italy's rating to Baa3 - the lowest
investment grade category - on Friday as expected. [L3N1WZ5VO]
But investors had fretted it would also set the outlook at
""negative"" because of the budget proposals. [nL8N1X216H]

    MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The turmoil in Italian asset
markets since May has forced Rome to tighten a state guarantee
scheme devised to help banks offload bad loans, making it
costlier for lenders, an EU Commission document showed.
    Regulators and investors see efforts to clean up bad loans
as crucial for the full recovery of the Italian banking sector,
which is again in the market's crosshairs due to the falling
value of its large sovereign bond holdings.
    Italy introduced the 'GACS' guarantee scheme in 2016 to help
banks tackle a 360 billion euro ($414 billion) pile of problem
loans left behind after a deep recession.
    The Commission on Aug. 31 granted a final six-month
extension to the scheme, which allows banks to buy a guarantee
from the state at market prices to ease sales of bad loans
repackaged as securities.
    The price of the guarantee reflects the cost of insuring
debt issued by a basket of Italian corporates and financials
against default, as measured by credit default swaps (CDS).
    However, CDS on Italy's debt <ITGV5YUSAC=MG> have nearly
tripled since mid May, when investors were spooked by the
prospect of a new anti-establishment coalition government with
profligate spending plans and anti-euro rhetoric.
    In approving the extension to the GACS scheme, the
Commission noted that such a sharp increase in CDS levels,
including a 40 percent rise on one day, was a very rare event.
    ""The fact that CDS premiums have not eased considerably
since then could be interpreted as a ... change in the market,
representing a fundamental reassessment of risks inherent to
Italy,"" the Commission said. 
    To avoid breaching EU state aid rules when seeking the
renewal, Italy proposed calculating the CDS average, which is
used to price the GACS, over a period of two months, instead of
the six months used previously, when the difference between the
two calculations exceeds a certain threshold.
    The shortening of the calculation period prevents Italian
banks from benefiting from the lower CDS levels before the
market sell-off. 
    A person working on a bad loan sale said the changes
translated into lower prices for the bad loan portfolios being
sold and hence larger losses for banks, stymieing the bad loan
market.
    After a slow start due to the patchy state of Italian banks'
loan records and its own complexity, the GACS scheme has been a
key contributor to banks' bad debt sales. 
    Bad loans are normally sold at a loss and the hit to banks'
capital limits the amount of these assets lenders can offload.
    The guarantee wraps the least risky notes in bad loan
securitisation issues, reducing the overall financing cost of
the transaction, helping banks achieve a better price. 
    Italian banks had cut their pile of impaired debt to 264
billion euros by the end of last year, according to consultancy
PwC. 
    Bailed-out Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> has tapped the GACS
scheme in a record 24 billion euro bad loan securitisation.
UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, Creval <PCVI.MI>, Carige <CRGI.MI> are
among other banks that have used the guarantee.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>,
which is involved in a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money
laundering scandal in Estonia, processed a large share of the
country's cross-border payments between 2008 and 2015, its
central bank said on Monday.
    Estonia has been rocked by revelations that banks there
laundered money from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via
non-resident bank accounts.
    Media reports this month suggested that the scale of the
money laundering through the small Baltic country may have been
larger then previously thought.
    ""Statistics show clearly that a large share of total
cross-border payments was processed by Danske Bank,"" the
Estonian central bank said in a statement.
    The central bank said earlier this month that banks doing
business in Estonia handled cross-border transactions of more
than $1 trillion in and out of the country between 2008 and
2017. [nL8N1WJ3YI]
    At the peak in 2013, Danske Bank processed 29.8 billion
euros of payments going out of the country, giving it a market
share by volume of 41.3 percent, the central bank said.

    BERLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Siemens's <SIEGn.DE> chief
executive said on Monday he would not attend a three-day Future
Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia after the
country admitted that journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been killed
in its consulate in Istanbul.
    The German engineering giant was one of the last companies
to decide against sending its top executive to the conference
after Riyadh sought to cover up Khashoggi's Oct. 2 death before
admitting to a ""grave mistake"". [nL8N1X10M8] 
    ""Siemens is a reliable and committed partner of the kingdom
and its VISION 2030. But for now, truth needs to be found out
and justice applied,"" Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser said in a statement
posted on his LinkedIn account outlining his motivation not to
travel to the conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh.
    ""Time will tell how things will develop. And I do hope there
will be clarity, transparency, and justice sooner rather than
later,"" he said.
    Khashoggi's killing in Istanbul had been ""monstrously
planned"", a spokesman for Turkey's ruling AK party said on
Monday. An adviser to Turkey's president rejected Riyadh's
assertion that Khashoggi died in a fight, suggesting this
""mocked"" international opinion. [nL8N1X232D] [nZ8N1VS00Z]
    Three European powers - Germany, Britain and France -
pressed Saudi Arabia to present all the facts in the killing,
and Chancellor Angela Merkel said over the weekend that Germany
would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while uncertainty over
Khashoggi's fate persisted. [nS8N1TF01R]
    Last week ABB <ABBN.S> Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer
said he would also bow out of attending, following in the
footsteps of others including Airbus <AIR.PA> defence chief Dirk
Hoke and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> CEO Christian
Sewing.[nZ8N1VS00Z].
    Senior finance and trade officials from various Western
governments including the United States will also shun the
forthcoming conference because of Khashoggi's killing.
    Kaeser said his decision to skip the event was no
condemnation of the Saudi population or a value judgment on
Siemens's 2,000 local employees in Saudi Arabia and partners
like Saudi Aramco, SABIC, SEC and the Abunayyan group. 
    Kaeser said he wanted to consider the interests of all
stakeholders, taking into account a business opportunity worth
up to $30 billion by 2030 as well as the company's reputation,
before taking a decision.
    ""But sometimes, situations develop in such a way that no one
can win, where every option is wrong. The so-called Khashoggi
crisis, the death of Jamal Khashoggi, is such a situation.""

    * German targets banks in multi-billion-euro fraud probe
    * Danish prime minister calls for European cooperation
    * EU lawmaker pushes for public enquiry

    By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - European politicians have
called for action to tackle dividend stripping after Reuters and
other media revealed how large banks were involved in trading
schemes that cost taxpayers billions of euros.
    In Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation,
prosecutors in Cologne are investigating banks involved in the
trades, which secured illicit double tax rebates on dividend
payouts. 
    Danish authorities are also seeking to recover hundreds of
millions of euros in tax rebates they paid out after falling
victim to a similar scheme and have filed dozens of lawsuits
this year against individuals in the United States. 
    ""It is large-scale greed, and we will pursue the culprits,""
said Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen.
    ""That this is a problem across Europe makes me even more
upset ... The answer ... is closer international cooperation.""
    Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly
involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of
internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as
part of a European media investigation called the ""cum-ex files""
coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv. [nL8N1WP2EL] 
    These documents showed that prosecutors in Cologne opened a
tax investigation into Santander <SAN.MC> in June. They believe
its role in the scheme was to carry out trades. Other banks are
being investigated as part of the wider probe.
    Santander said it was ""fully cooperating"" with German
authorities and conducting an internal investigation. 
    Jeppe Kofod, a Danish member of the European Parliament's
committee on tax evasion and financial crime, called for a
public hearing by lawmakers to quiz banks about the scheme. 
    ""Several of the biggest European banks are involved,"" Kofod
told Reuters. ""It is a European issue."" 
    Germany made three attempts to stamp out the practice by
changing and clarifying the law in 2007 and 2009 before finally
succeeding in 2012.
    
    TIGHTER CHECKS
    The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark has
prompted other countries, including Austria and Belgium, to open
their own investigations. They have discovered that they were
also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.
    A spokeswoman for the Belgian finance ministry said it was
investigating a similar fraud after it discovered illicit tax
reclaims. It repaid 201 million euros before halting far larger
reclaims, some as recent as 2017.
    State prosecutors in Austria have also opened an
investigation into similar trades, a spokeswoman said.
    ""The culprits tried to replicate the fraudulent scheme used
in Germany in Austria,"" she said, adding that a joint
investigative team had been launched with prosecutors in
Cologne. ""The investigation is very advanced,"" she said.
    Norway also fell victim to the fraud in 2013 with a loss of
580,000 Norwegian krone ($71,270) according to the tax
authorities. Norway was was able to stop 10 further attempts in
2015 in fraudulent claims of $4.3 million.
    ""After discovering these fraud attempts we introduced much
tighter checks before paying refunds,"" said Hans Christian
Holte, director general of the Norwegian Tax Administration.
    The circle of countries that theoretically could have fallen
victim is even wider, according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, which has monitored the situation. 
    Responding to the investigation, French Budget Minister
Gerald Darmanin said on twitter: ""If the frauds are confirmed,
we will be ruthless.""
    The scheme involved trading a company stock rapidly around a
syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the
impression of numerous owners - each entitled to a tax rebate.
    ""We need to look at our laws to make sure they can stop this
kind of large-scale tax fraud,"" said Tove Maria Ryding of the
European Network on Debt and Development, which campaigns on tax
issues.

    By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
    COPENHAGEN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>,
which is involved in a 200 billion euro ($230 billion) money
laundering scandal in Estonia, processed a large share of the
country's cross-border payments between 2008 and 2015, its
central bank said on Monday.
    Estonia has been rocked by revelations that banks there
laundered money from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan via
non-resident bank accounts.
    Shares in Nordic banks Swedbank <SWEDa.ST>, SEB <SEBa.ST>
and Nordea <NDAFI.HE> slumped when media reports this month
suggested that the scale of the money laundering through the
small Baltic country may have been larger then previously
thought.
    ""Statistics show clearly that a large share of total
cross-border payments was processed by Danske Bank,"" the
Estonian central bank said in a statement.
    The central bank said earlier this month that banks doing
business in Estonia handled cross-border transactions of more
than $1 trillion in and out of the country between 2008 and
2017. [nL8N1WJ3YI]
    At the peak in 2013, Danske Bank processed 29.8 billion
euros of payments going out of the country, giving it a market
share by volume of 41.3 percent, the central bank said.
    In the 2008-2015 period, Danske processed 147.7 billion
euros of the total 446.5 billion payments going out of the
country, while Swedbank, SEB and Nordea processed 104.5 billion
euros, 74.8 billion euros and 44.4 billion euros, respectively,
according to the central bank.

 (Updates to reflect cooling of Italian bond rally, adds quotes)
    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Italian bond market was
headed for one of its best days on Monday since early June after
Moody's did not slap on a negative outlook as the market had
feared, but the rally cooled as the session wore on and stocks
slipped back into the red.
    Italian short-dated bond yields were still down 17-20 basis
points but gave up some of the price gains made earlier in the
session as the market digested a ratings report by Moody's which
nonetheless lowered the rating by one notch to Baa3.  
    The 1.5 percent fall in Italian banking stocks <.FTIT8300>
also hurt sentiment, with one trader citing a report that the
government has tightened a state guarantee scheme devised to
help banks offload bad loans as a possible cause. [nL8N1X237Q]
    On Friday, Moody's downgraded Italy's rating to the lowest
investment grade category, as expected. 
    But investors had fretted it would also set the outlook at
""negative"" following high-spending budget proposals that put
Rome at odds with Brussels.
    Moody's gave the outlook as stable however, triggering a
relief rally across Italian bond and stock markets. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
 
    But the rally later subsided, with analysts citing concerns
that Moody’s might be willing to cut the outlook to negative
during the course of next year as a driver.
    ""It is mostly the growth outlook which is probably the point
on which Moody’s has been the most critical,"" said Cyril Regnat,
fixed income strategist at Natixis. 
    He said that a downturn on Italian GDP growth might
eventually warrant a negative outlook on Italy, perhaps after
the first half of next year.
    
    BENCHMARK
    Italy's two-year government bond yield was last down 18
basis points having  hit a two-week low of 1.42 percent earlier
in the session. The benchmark 10-year yield was 11 bps lower at
3.47 percent <IT2YT=RR> <IT10YT=RR>.        
    The Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread was
last at 302.8 bps, having hit a low of 281.6 bps earlier in the
session <DE10IT10=RR> . 
    Jitters remain as the European Union is expected to ask
Italy on Tuesday to revise its draft budget in what would be the
first such action against a member state. [nL8N1X10UW]
    But the possibility of ""Italexit"" was ruled out by senior
Italian politicians. [nL8N1X242B]
    S&P Global also is scheduled to review Italy's credit rating
on Friday. It now rates the country two notches above junk at
BBB and has the outlook at stable. 
    Analyst expectations are mixed, with some expecting a
one-notch downgrade while others expect only a change in the
outlook to negative from stable currently. 
    ""In our view S&P will likely only put a negative outlook, so
we might see a similar to relief rally to Moody’s as removes a
possible risk (of a one-notch downgrade),"" said Luigi Speranza,
head of European Economics at BNP Paribas.     
    Should the EU decide to reject the draft budget anyway, it
would formally begin a long legal dispute that will increase
market pressure on Italy until it is resolved. [nL8N1WV23B]    
    Fitch on Friday upgraded Cyprus's credit ratings to BBB-
from BB+, the second ratings agency in the space of little over
a month to pull the island back into investment grade territory
after a bailout in 2013. The country's 10-year bond yields were
lower eight bps at 2.31 percent on Monday. <CY10YT=RR> 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for
the region, was up 1.4 pbs to 0.445 percent. <DE10YT=RR>

    NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Monday
as the British pound fell on news that Brexit negotiations with
the European Union over Northern Ireland remain in flux and as
the euro continued its slide on political uncertainty over
Italy's budget. 
    Prime Minister Theresa May was on Monday say that 95 percent
of Britain's Brexit deal has been agreed but repeat her
opposition to an EU proposal for the Irish border, according to
excerpts from her statement to Parliament. Sterling was down
0.84 percent in the North American session to $1.297 <GBP=>.
    With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to
exit the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the
so-called Northern Irish ""backstop,"" an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed upon in
time. [nL8N1X21VU]
    The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of six rivals, was up 0.24 percent from its close on
Friday, last at 95.946 <.DXY>.
    The euro failed to hold early-session gains as investors
focused on the likelihood of further political uncertainty in
Europe over Italy's spending plans, despite a large drop in
Italian government borrowing costs.
    Rating agency Moody's downgraded Italy's credit rating on
Friday but unexpectedly kept the outlook at stable. [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    That, along with more conciliatory comments from Italian
officials that they were ready to sit down with European Union
officials and did not intend to expand the deficit beyond 2019,
boosted demand for Italian debt after a weeks-long sell-off.
    But the euro, its fortunes increasingly linked this year to
Italian bond prices, failed to hold early gains and dropped 0.66
percent from a session high of $1.1550. It was last at $1.1474
<EUR=>. [nL8N1WZ4VO] [nR1N1VZ02J]
    ""We have more conciliatory tones from both sides but it is
still clear that this dispute is not over yet,"" Commerzbank
analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    The single currency also weakened against the Swiss franc by
0.3 percent and was last at 1.432 <EURCHF=>. But it remained
stronger against the pound, up 0.4 percent from Friday's close,
last at 88.42 pence <EURGBP=>.
    Equity markets were mostly positive as hopes that China's
tax cuts next year could be worth more than 1 percent of gross
domestic product sparked a rally in Asian shares that fed across
to Europe and the United States. [nL3N1X24BY]
    The Australian dollar, which tends to benefit when China
sentiment improves because of its exposure to Chinese demand,
dropped 0.4 percent to $0.709 <AUD=>.

 (Adds Brussels position, details from May's speech)
    By Kylie MacLellan and William James
    LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May urged
restive lawmakers to back her in the final stages of Britain's
exit from the European Union, saying talks were in their most
difficult phase even if a deal was close.   
    After facing some of the fiercest attacks to date over her
Brexit plans since again failing to clinch a deal at an EU
summit last week, May tried to calm passions in parliament where
her strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU supporters alike.
    ""Serving our national interest will demand that we hold our
nerve through these last stages of the negotiations, the hardest
part of all,"" May told parliament.
    Financial markets seized on the possibility that May could
be toppled as prime minister by rebels in her Conservative
Party, driving sterling below $1.30 to its lowest since Oct. 4.
[nL8N1X2283]
    With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to
exit the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the
so-called Northern Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy to
ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of
Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. 
    But May's attempt to unlock the talks by considering an
extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current
proposed end date of December 2020 has further riled both pro-
and anti-EU factions in her deeply split Conservative Party.
    May again dismissed the EU's proposed backstop as
unacceptable and she set out two options for Britain to choose
from: an extension to the transition period, or a temporary
UK-EU customs territory which was first outlined earlier this
year.
    May said the EU had made a substantial shift on the latter
option. EU sources told Reuters negotiators were looking at ways
to promise Britain a customs deal that could stretch Brussels’
Brexit red lines but might break a deadlock. [nL8N1X250D]  
    In an attempt to highlight how much progress has been made
in more than a year of talks with the EU, she told parliament
the government has reached agreement on everything from
Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks.
    ""Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal
Agreement and its protocols are now settled,"" she said.
    
    ""VASSAL STATE""
    But the deal - the terms of Britain's divorce - cannot be
signed off until the two sides settle on future management of
the border between Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland.
    British and EU leaders are committed to avoiding obstacles
at the border, a crucial aspect of the 1998 Good Friday peace
deal that ended decades of Irish sectarian bloodshed.
    The EU proposal for Northern Ireland to remain in the bloc's
customs union has been rejected by May as it would potentially
create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain - something
ruled out by Northern Ireland's DUP party, whose 10 votes in
parliament prop up May's government.
    At an EU summit in Brussels last week, any agreement seemed
just as far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and
diplomats saying that May had offered nothing new to ease the
deadlock. [nL8N1WY1X5]
    Since then, her proposal to extend the transition period has
stoked anger among Conservative eurosceptics, who fear she is
leading Britain into a deal that will make Britain a ""vassal
state"" indefinitely - unable ever to fully leave the EU or to
forge its own free trade deals with other countries.
    Critics of May used Britain's Sunday newspapers to
rhetorically savage the British leader, with unnamed rivals
using phrases such as ""assassination is in the air"".
    However, that approach looked to have backfired as even
May's harshest critics condemned the violent nature of the
comments, tempering any confrontation with their leader. 
    A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48
Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the
party's so-called ""1922 Committee"" of backbenchers to demand
such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent, but
Reuters could not verify that number. [nL8N1X247N]
    However a planned show of strength among the Brexiteers, who
intended to rebel at a vote on Northern Ireland legislation in
parliament later this week, was called off by the leader of the
rebellion, former minister Steve Baker.

fiscal surplus for the fourth successive year in 2019 and
forecasts its economy to grow by 5.3 percent in real terms,
Finance Minister Edward Scicluna said on Monday when he
presented the Mediterranean island's 2019 budget.
    Scicluna said the surplus in 2019 was projected to reach 1.3
percent of gross domestic product, including proceeds from a
controversial scheme by which the country sells foreigners the
right to Maltese citizenship.
    Net of the proceeds from the scheme, the surplus will amount
to 0.5 percent of GDP, the finance minister said.
    The total surplus in 2018 is targeted at 1.1 percent.
    ""Our unofficial target is to achieve a surplus every year,""
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told reporters.
    Scicluna said the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to drop to
43 percent next year from 47 per cent in 2018.
    He said the budget would not introduce any new taxes or
tariffs, but revenue was still projected to increase by 8.4
percent in 2019, mostly as a result of economic growth.
    He said the government was raising its expenditure by 8
percent, with most of the increase going on a major roads
improvement programme.
    Employment is projected to grow by 3.7 percent in 2019 while
the unemployment rate is seen at 4.3 percent, similar to 2018.
Inflation is forecast at 1.9 percent.
    Earlier on Monday, Eurostat said Malta's budget surplus of
3.5 percent of GDP in 2017 was the largest of any EU country.

adjust measures in its contested 2019 budget should markets
react negatively and the spread between the ten-year government
bond yields compared to the German ones spike, daily il
Messaggero reported on Tuesday.
    The government's 'plan B' would involve redefining the
retirement measures and the basic income for the poor, two key
points of its expansionary budget, il Messagero reported,
without giving details of its sources.

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds reversed
some early losses on Tuesday, with short-dated yields as much as
six basis points lower after Il Messagero newspaper reported the
coalition government was prepared to adjust budget plans should
markets demand it.
    The markets had opened sharply lower, with two-year yields
down 10 bps at one point, as markets awaited the European
Union's official response to Rome's 2019 budget proposal and an
upcoming ratings review by Standard & Poor's. 
    However, the report by Il Messagero swung sentiment around.
The newspaper did not say whether the alternative budget would
lower the deficit to less than 2.4 percent but noted that a euro
exit was not on the cards.
    However, the report comes just a day after Italy told the
European Commission it would stick to its contested 2019 budget
plans in defiance of European Union fiscal rules, though it
promised not to inflate its deficit any further in the years
ahead. [nL8N1X22UD]
    The Commission will decide on Tuesday the next steps in the
procedure for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget. [nB5N1VQ00I]
    Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank, said the Il
Messagero report had moved the market but described it as ""pie
in the sky"" given the coalition government's stance.
    ""The content of the report is that they would be prepared to
water down some of their proposals if the market puts them under
too much pressure. We are in a funny feedback loop - if the
spread stays where it is they won’t have to do this, but it
probably won’t stay here, something has got to give,""
Graham-Taylor said, referring to the yield gap between Italy and
German  bonds.
    The gap, effectively a gauge of Italian risk, narrowed
around 10 bps to 303 bps after the Il Messagero report
<IT10DE10=RR>. It had recently hit 5-1/2 year highs approaching
340 bps, levels that could be problematic for the country's
economy and borrowing costs.
    ""We still favour being short Italy, on the basis that market
pressure is the only thing that will drive a change in the
budget,"" Graham-Taylor added.
    By 0830 GMT, two-year Italian yields were down 3 bps to 1.43
percent <IT2YT=RR>, five-year yields likewise slipped 3 bps to
2.76 percent <IT5YT=RR> and 10-year yields were down 2 bps at
3.45 percent <IT10YT=RR>.
     However, Italian uncertainties, along with fears of a
challenge to British Prime Minister Theresa May and global
equity wobbles, kept German bond yields lower, while other
high-grade European debt was also well bid as investors sought
safety <DE10YT=RR>, <FR10YT=RR>.
    However, German bond prices too trimmed gains, with yields
standing some 2 bps lower at 0.43 percent <DE10YT=RR>
    Italy's bond market had enjoyed a rally on Monday after
Moody's lowered its credit rating to Baa3 - one notch above the
much feared junk status - but with a stable outlook. Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte had also soothed fears of a euro zone
crisis, saying: ""Read my lips. There is no way Italy will leave
the euro."" [nL8N1X22UD]
    But attention will now focus to a ratings review by Standard
& Poor's on Friday, as well as the budget response later today. 
    ""Not all the information is on the table yet, the base case
is that S&P will lower the outlook but there is also a risk of a
downgrade there, so many market participants are reluctant to
take positions in BTPs,"" said ING rates strategist Benjamin
Schroeder.

    By Julien Ponthus
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - European shares fell to their
lowest levels in nearly two years on Tuesday after a
disappointing batch of third-quarter results, particularly in
the tech sector, amid ongoing worries on Brexit, Italy's budget,
Saudi isolation, trade wars, Chinese growth and U.S. interest
rates. 
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <STOXX> was down 1.3 percent at
0838 GMT, its lowest since December 2016, as it headed towards a
fifth day of losses after a negative close in Asia and on Wall
Street.    
    Other benchmarks sustained heavy losses: the Paris CAC 40
<.FCHI> fell 1.3 percent and Germany's DAX <.GDAXi> lost 2
percent, also at December 2016 lows.
    The Frankfurt bourse's blue chips are down 16.7 percent
since their January high and not far from a 20 percent fall,
which typically defines a bear market.  
    ""Risk off the table as geopolitical tensions remain,"" was
the message from LCG analyst Jasper Lawler to his clients ahead
of the open.
    The European tech sector <.SX8P> posted the worst
performance, down 3.7 percent as chipmaker AMS <AMS.S> tumbled
and lost 17 percent after its outlook failed to convince
investors. [nL8N1X25PX] 
    The sector, a key driver of stock markets, is down 18.4
percent since its June peak, also not far from bear market
levels.  
    French IT services company Atos ATOS.PA cut its revenue
growth forecast for 2018 on Tuesday, citing disappointing
results in Germany and North America and global economic
uncertainty. [nL8N1X30X0]    
    Also losing were Sweden's Saab <SAABb.ST>, which announced a
rights issue, and Finnish ship technology and power plant maker
Wartsila <WRT1V.HE>, after a lower-than-expected quarterly
profit.
    Among heavy weights, Germany's Bayer <BAYGn.DE> dropped 7
percent after a U.S. judge affirmed a verdict against its
Monsanto unit that found Monsanto weed-killers caused a man’s
terminal cancer. [nL2N1X300J]

    He warned of growing problems faced by Italian banks due to
higher yields on Italy's debt, but underlined the country's
banking woes were different from those experienced by Spanish
lenders when Spain asked the European Stability Mechanism rescue
fund a bailout in 2012.
    ""In Italy itself there is contagion to the banking sector""
because of the falling value of Italy's debt held by lenders,
Regling said, adding that this has been reflected in banking
funding costs.
    He added that ""one or two"" Greek banks had also partly
suffered of contagion from Italy, but said problems at these
banks, which he did not name, were also caused by very high
levels of bad debt.

    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday before a
meeting of the European Commission on Italy's budget that could
see Brussels take the unprecedented step of rejecting it and
demanding changes.
    The dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the
leadership of Britain's prime minister who is mired in a
stalemate over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the
likelihood of further political turmoil in Europe. 
    Broad risk aversion pervaded currency markets on Tuesday,
with the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening,
while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New
Zealand dollars fell.
    Worries about Italy's spending has bred some doubt about the
European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates next summer
and that has hurt the euro. But on Tuesday, it rose 0.2 percent
to $1.1486. <EUR=EBS>  
    Italy's bond yields fell on Tuesday before the European
Commission's meeting. Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup
of eurozone finance ministers, said on Monday he was confident
an agreement could be reached.
    ""The prospect of a normalisation of monetary policy was the
main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past
year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now
going to crumble,"" Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
    Tensions are likely to rise further between Rome and
Brussels, especially if the European Council launch an
""Excessive Deficit Procedure"" against Italy, said Philip Wee,
currency strategist at DBS in a note.
    ""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective
action to rein in its large public debt,"" Wee said.
    The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its value against six
other major currencies, fell 0.2 percent after earlier reaching
a two-month high of 96.158. 
    Turbulence in Europe has lifted the dollar recently along
with expectations that a strong U.S. economy may see the Federal
Reserve raise rates faster than assumed. 
    Britain's pound traded up 0.2 percent at $1.30 after falling
on Monday on fears that the Irish border issue and disagreements
within Britain's ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see
Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge.
[nL8N1X2283] 
    ""Whispers of a growing number of Tory MP rebels losing their
patience with May have put the risks of a lengthy UK political
impasse and a Brexit policy mistake (exiting the EU without a
deal) back on the table,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency
strategist at ING.
    ""We think this noise is likely to keep the pound on the back
foot this week,"" he said.
    The dollar weakened half a percent against the Japanese yen
<JPY=D3> to trade at 112.32 yen as risk-shy investors retreated
from Asia's main share markets. [nL3N1X3077]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=D3> lost 0.1 percent versus the
U.S. dollar on Tuesday, changing hands at 0.7089. It lost 0.6
percent on Monday.

    * EU due to discuss and decide on response to Italy budget
    * Focus now on Standard & Poor's ratings review
    * Italian yields up to 10 bps higher
    * Safe haven bonds down 2-3 bps

    By Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds reversed
some early losses on Tuesday, with short-dated yields as much as
six basis points lower after Il Messagero newspaper reported the
coalition government was prepared to adjust budget plans should
markets demand it.
    The markets had opened sharply lower, with two-year yields
up 10 bps at one point, as markets awaited the European Union's
official response to Rome's 2019 budget proposal and an upcoming
ratings review by Standard & Poor's. 
    However, the report by Il Messagero swung sentiment around.
The newspaper did not say whether the alternative budget would
lower the deficit to less than 2.4 percent but noted that a euro
exit was not on the cards.
    However, the report comes just a day after Italy told the
European Commission it would stick to its contested 2019 budget
plans in defiance of European Union fiscal rules, though it
promised not to inflate its deficit any further in the years
ahead. [nL8N1X22UD]
    The Commission will decide on Tuesday the next steps in the
procedure for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget. [nB5N1VQ00I]
    Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank, said the Il
Messagero report had moved the market but described it as ""pie
in the sky"" given the coalition government's stance.
    ""The content of the report is that they would be prepared to
water down some of their proposals if the market puts them under
too much pressure. We are in a funny feedback loop - if the
spread stays where it is they won’t have to do this, but it
probably won’t stay here, something has got to give,""
Graham-Taylor said, referring to the yield gap between Italy and
German  bonds.
    The gap, effectively a gauge of Italian risk, narrowed
around 10 bps to 303 bps after the Il Messagero report
<IT10DE10=RR>. It had recently hit 5-1/2 year highs approaching
340 bps, levels that could be problematic for the country's
economy and borrowing costs.
    ""We still favour being short Italy, on the basis that market
pressure is the only thing that will drive a change in the
budget,"" Graham-Taylor added.
    By 0830 GMT, two-year Italian yields were down 3 bps to 1.43
percent <IT2YT=RR>, five-year yields likewise slipped 3 bps to
2.76 percent <IT5YT=RR> and 10-year yields were down 2 bps at
3.45 percent <IT10YT=RR>.
     However, Italian uncertainties, along with fears of a
challenge to British Prime Minister Theresa May and global
equity wobbles, kept German bond yields lower, while other
high-grade European debt was also well bid as investors sought
safety <DE10YT=RR>, <FR10YT=RR>.
    However, German bond prices too trimmed gains, with yields
standing some 2 bps lower at 0.43 percent <DE10YT=RR>
    Italy's bond market had enjoyed a rally on Monday after
Moody's lowered its credit rating to Baa3 - one notch above the
much feared junk status - but with a stable outlook. Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte had also soothed fears of a euro zone
crisis, saying: ""Read my lips. There is no way Italy will leave
the euro."" [nL8N1X22UD]
    But attention will now focus to a ratings review by Standard
& Poor's on Friday, as well as the budget response later today. 
    ""Not all the information is on the table yet, the base case
is that S&P will lower the outlook but there is also a risk of a
downgrade there, so many market participants are reluctant to
take positions in BTPs,"" said ING rates strategist Benjamin
Schroeder.

    * Says Italy not like three-times bailout recipient Greece
    * Debt woes reverse Italian banks' recent positive trend

 (Adds details, context)
    By Francesco Guarascio
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The head of the euro zone's
rescue fund said on Tuesday that Italy's free-spending fiscal
plans were a risk that was troubling domestic banks, but
cautioned against panic because contagion to other countries had
been ""very limited"".
    Italy's draft 2019 budget targets a deficit of 2.4 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP), which is far above commitments
made by the previous government and risks increasing the
country's huge public debt pile in breach of EU fiscal rules.  
    ""There is a risk with Italy. We are worried about Italy
because the fiscal plans are not compatible with the EU fiscal
framework,"" Klaus Regling told a news conference in Luxembourg.
     His comments came hours before the EU Commission discusses
the next steps to take on a procedure that could lead to an
unprecedented rejection of the Italian budget plan and, in the
longer-term, to fines.
    Regling, who chairs the Luxembourg-based European Stability
Mechanism (ESM) rescue fund, stressed Italy's debt problems were
different from those of Greece, which needed three euro zone
bailouts over the last decade.
    ""One should not really get into panic here,"" Regling said,
listing the differences between Italy's current situation and
Greece's long crisis.
    He said Italy's fundamentals were much more solid as the
country had only a limited nominal deficit and a current account
surplus, adding that its debt had a relatively long average
maturity which helped shield the country from market pressure.
        
    BANK WOES
    Regling warned, however, about the risks faced by the
Italian banking sector due to higher yields on government debt,
which reduce the value of lenders' large holdings of Italian
bonds and could force recapitalisations. 
    Since budgetary plans were agreed by Italy's eurosceptic
government this month, the nation's funding costs have spiked
and the gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yield
spreads briefly reached its widest level in 5-1/2 years. 
    ""It's sad what is happening to the Italian banks now because
they were on a good way,"" Regling said, citing the rapid
reduction of bad loans in banks' balance sheets and banking
reforms over the last two years as positive developments.
    ""There was quite a positive trend. Now they suffer from the
deterioration in the sovereign debt and that spills over very
automatically. So that makes their life complicated again,"" he
said.
    Asked whether Italy should consider asking for ESM financial
support for its banks as Spain did in 2012, Regling said the
current situation was different due to stricter rules on EU
banking and state aid.
    ""I would not recommend at the moment to go the same way (as
Spain did),"" Regling said.
    Although Italy's debt woes have already spilled into the
domestic banking system, Regling said there has been so far
""very limited contagion"" to other euro zone countries.
    He added that ""one or two"" Greek banks had suffered due to
contagion from Italy, but said their problems were also caused
by very high levels of bad debt. He did not name the lenders.

    By Virginia Furness and Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Italian government bonds steadied
on Tuesday after a newspaper report suggested the coalition
government was ready to adjust its 2019 budget plans should
markets react negatively, boosting other euro zone debt markets
as well. 
    The report in Il Messaggero helped to support a market that
has been battered by Rome's contentious spending plans in recent
weeks. [nL8N1X31RK]
    Also, Mario Centeno, who heads the Eurogroup of euro zone
finance ministers, said late on Monday that the latest messages
from Rome and the European Commission over the Italian budget
are ""very positive"" and he expects agreement to be reached on
the blueprint. [nL8N1X25J3]
    ""The feeling among investors is that the tone of Italian
political leaders has been slightly less defiant this week than
previously, and more aimed at trying to find some sort of
compromise,"" said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  
    ""I personally was quite struck by a comment by Centeno that
they were trying to find a compromise and were upbeat on the
prospects,"" he added.     
    Having risen sharply in early trade, short-dated Italian
government bond yields were two basis points lower on the day.
<IT2YT=RR> <IT5YT=RR> 
    Longer-dated yields were unchanged on the day and the
closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread was at
305 bps, well below the recent highs of over 330 bps.
<DE10IT10=RR> 
    Just the lack of further negative news on Italy encouraged
investors to buy up some other euro zone government debt, said
Van Vliet. Spanish 10-year yields were down five bps and
Portuguese, French and Belgian yields were also lower on the
day. <ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR> <FR10YT=RR> <BE10YT=RR> 
    Analysts warned however, that risks lie ahead. Most notably,
the Commission will decide on Tuesday the next steps in the
procedure for assessing Italy's 2019 draft budget. [nB5N1VQ00I]
    Also, Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank,
described the Il Messagero report as ""pie in the sky"" given the
coalition government's stance.
    ""The content of the report is that they would be prepared to
water down some of their proposals if the market puts them under
too much pressure. We are in a funny feedback loop - if the
spread stays where it is they won’t have to do this, but it
probably won’t stay here, something has got to give,"" he said,
referring to the yield gap between Italy and German bonds.
    ""We still favour being short Italy, on the basis that market
pressure is the only thing that will drive a change in the
budget.""
    These Italian uncertainties, along with fears of a
leadership challenge to British Prime Minister Theresa May over
Brexit and global equity wobbles, kept German yields about two
basis points lower, while other high-grade European debt was
also well bid as investors sought safety <DE10YT=RR>,
<NL10YT=RR>.   
    Italy's bond market had enjoyed a rally on Monday after
Moody's lowered its credit rating to Baa3 - one notch above the
much feared junk status - but with a stable outlook. Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte had also soothed fears of a euro zone
crisis, saying: ""Read my lips. There is no way Italy will leave
the euro."" [nL8N1X22UD]

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Italian bond yields rose sharply
on Tuesday, reversing falls  earlier in the session, as the
European Commission rejected Italy's draft budget and gave Rome
three weeks to come up with a revised version. 
    The Commission sent back the 2019 budget for breaking
European Union rules, exercising for the first time a power it
obtained during the sovereign debt crisis. [nB5N1SU00Y] 
    ""The Italian government has three weeks to rewrite its
budget proposal which seems quite unlikely to me; if anything,
(Italy's) tone has been quite belligerent,"" said DZ Bank rates
strategist Christian Lenk. ""The car is moving further towards
the wall without anyone hitting the brakes.""
    Italy's two-year borrowing costs rose 12 basis points to hit
the day's high of 1.58 percent, reversing earlier falls, before
easing back a touch to around 1.53 percent by 1500 GMT.
Benchmark 10-year yields rose to 3.586 percent before dropping
slightly to 3.55 percent, still up eight bps on the day.
<IT2YT=RR> 
    The closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread
widened to 315 bps, 12 bps wider on the day. <DE10IT10=RR> 
    Investors headed instead for the safety of better-rated euro
zone government debt, pushing lower the borrowing costs of
countries such as Germany and France. 
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield was down four bps at
0.41 percent, pushed down also by a global stock market selloff
<DE10YT=RR>.
    Meanwhile, Italy's top share index <.FTMIB> was down 1.1
percent, staying above session lows hit in early trading, while
the banking index <.FTIT8300> was down 0.7 percent, on course
for its lowest close since December 2016. 
    Italy's contentious spending plans had pushed yields to
4-1/2 year highs last week on concern they would lead to
conflict with Brussels and hurt Italy's credit ratings. 
    On Monday, the Italian Treasury told the Commission that it
would stick to its contested budget plans, but promised to
intervene if it failed to meet its debt and deficit goals.
[nR1N1VZ02J]
    But Commission Vice President for the euro, Valdis
Dombrovskis, told a news conference this clarification was not
convincing enough to change the EU's conclusions.
    The rise in yields comes towards the end of what has been a
volatile couple of sessions for the Italian bond market.
    On Monday, Italian debt rallied strongly after Moody's set a
stable outlook on the country's credit rating, though it
delivered an expected downgrade to Baa3, the lowest investment
grade rating [nL3N1WZ5VO]
    A report by Il Messaggero earlier on Tuesday suggested the
coalition government was ready to adjust its 2019 budget plans
should markets react negatively [nL8N1X31RK].
    While that boosted bonds for a while, those gains have been
all but wiped out. At 3.56 percent, Italian 10-year yields are
just three basis points below Friday's closing level, which was
touched before the Moody's decision. <IT10YT=RR>

    ZURICH, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Switzerland and the European
Union are unlikely to strike a deal this year on a new treaty
streamlining their relations, current EU president Austria said
on Tuesday, suggesting some kind of transitional regime could
help matters as talks go on.
    Unlike Britain with its messy divorce from the EU,
Switzerland has a network of 120 sectoral accords with its
biggest trading partner that it can fall back on should stalled
treaty talks fail to progress. [nL8N1WE4JS][nL8N1WR5JF]
    But Brussels has said it could take punitive measures -
including refusing to extend beyond this year recognition of
Swiss bourse rules that allows cross-border stock trading -
should the treaty talks fail. [nL8N1WB57A]
    Austrian Economy Minister Margarete Schramboeck, whose
country holds the rotating EU presidency until year's end,
played down prospects for a quick deal.
    ""We want to lend support and would also like to see (the
treaty talks) progress although if we are realistic...we won't
get there during the Austrian presidency,"" she told reporters
after economy ministers from German-speaking countries met.
    ""Our wish would be to find a solution before the European
Parliament dissolves (next year) and then forms again, because
then it could take a long time.""
    Schramboeck said she was optimistic a deal was within reach,
but also said unspecified ""transition arrangements"" could help
bridge the gap while final details are worked out.
    Brussels has been pressing Switzerland to agree a pact that
would sit atop the existing patchwork of sectoral accords and
have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to single market rules.
    It would focus on five areas linked to the single market:
the free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport,
mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm
goods. The treaty would also provide a more effective platform
to resolve disputes. [nL8N1WC1TY]
    Schramboeck cited disagreements about the free movement of
people as a stumbling block in talks with the Swiss, whose rules
to protect high pay against competition from cross-border
skilled labour have long been a thorn in the side of neighbours.
    Elections in Switzerland next year are also injecting
politics into the treaty talks, already complicated by separate
EU negotiations with Britain on terms of its EU departure,
scheduled for March 29, 2019.
    The EU is loath to show too much flexibility with the Swiss
for fear of handing ammunition to British negotiators.

raised the retirement age, and gives people the option of
retiring at 62 years of age if they have paid 38 years of
pension contributions.
    Ratings agency Moody's, which downgraded Italy's sovereign

its report that the early retirement option was ""ostensibly a

    By Alissa de Carbonnel
    STRASBOURG, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission
rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget on Tuesday, saying it
brazenly broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to
submit a new one within three weeks or face disciplinary action.
    Italian bond yields jumped on the unprecedented move by the
EU executive which was exerting for the first time a power
obtained during the 2013 sovereign debt crisis, to send back a
budget of a euro zone country that violates the rules.    
    Having recently emerged from the Greek debt debacle that
nearly destroyed the single currency, the EU is concerned about
another possible crisis if debt-laden Italy were to lose market
trust.
    The Commission has previously dealt with France, Spain,
Portugal and previous Italian administrations that broke EU
fiscal rules, but none of those violations were as blatant as
the latest Italian budget draft, the Commission said. 
    ""Today, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to
request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,""
Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news
conference. 
    ""The Italian Government is openly and consciously going
against the commitments it made.""
    Yields of Italian benchmark 10-year bonds <IT10YT=TWEB>
surged on the news to 3.57 percent in the afternoon from 3.42
early on Tuesday.
    Rome will now have to send a new draft budget that would cut
the structural deficit, which excludes one-offs and business
cycle swings, by 0.6 percent of GDP, rather than increase it by
0.8 points as in the current plan, the Commission said.
    
    ITALY DEFIANT
    In a letter to the Commission on Monday, Italy acknowledged
that the draft violated EU rules, but said it would stick to it.
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio responded to the Commission
rejection by calling for ""respect"" for Italians.
    ""This is the first Italian budget that the EU doesn't like.
I am not surprised. This is the first Italian budget that was
written in Rome and not in Brussels,"" Di Maio said on Facebook.
    Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the government was
convinced it was ""in the right"".
    A spokeswoman for the economy ministry in Rome defended the
expansionary budget and said Italy stuck by its position that
the only way to cut public debt was by boosting economic growth.
[nR1N1VZ02O]
    Italy has the second highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU
after Greece, at 131.2 percent in 2017, and the highest debt
servicing costs in Europe. But it believes additional spending
through a higher deficit would boost growth, helping reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio.
    The Commission believes Italy's growth assumptions are
overly optimistic making the debt reduction plan questionable.
    ""Experience has shown time and again that higher fiscal
deficits and debt do not bring lasting growth. And excessive
debt makes your economy more vulnerable to future crisis,""
Dombrovskis said.
    Unless Rome changes the deficit assumptions, the Commission
said it would start disciplinary steps, called the excessive
deficit procedure.
    Under EU law, Italy should cut its public debt every year by
1/20 of the difference between 60 percent of GDP and its current
size, counted on average over three years -- in Italy's case
meaning several percent of GDP a year.
    The excessive deficit procedure can lead to fines of up to
0.2 percent of GDP if recommendations to cut the deficit and
debt are ignored.

    BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Even as British Prime Minister
Theresa May battles critics in her own party, she may be closing
in on a Brexit deal which has been stymied by arguments over the
Irish border. Here's how:
    
    IS A DEAL POSSIBLE?
    It might be almost done. Negotiators on both sides thought
they may have cracked it 10 days ago, EU diplomats told Reuters
[nL8N1WV2RY][nL8N1WV2RY]. The stumbling block seemed to be May
calculating that an EU demand for a special ""backstop"" clause
for Northern Ireland could not win support from her own party
and allies in parliament -- at least not just for the moment.
    
    WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
    Both sides want to avoid a ""hard border"" on the island of
Ireland -- customs posts that could reignite violence against
British rule. Britain says Brexit won't mean physical customs
checks. The EU says it might -- and so it wants London to sign a
treaty clause that could leave Northern Ireland inside the EU
customs space. May and pro-British Belfast allies reject that as
dividing the province from the mainland. Instead, May wants the
EU to let all of the UK stay in the customs area for a time.
    
    AND THE SOLUTION?
    The EU has tried to ramp up assurances that its ""Northern
Ireland-only"" backstop will not be triggered. Those assurances
had previously been simply that a political declaration on the
future EU-UK relationship, due to be agreed this year alongside
the withdrawal treaty that would smooth Britain's March exit,
would state that a way would be found to avoid customs posts. 
    But, EU sources tell Reuters, negotiations this month saw
the EU offer to strengthen that idea in the withdrawal treaty
itself, bending an EU ""red line"" about pre-empting trade talks
as part of an overall package deal to break the deadlock.
    They also offered to extend the treaty's transition period,
when nothing will change, by a year to the end of 2021 to help
ensure that a customs deal is ready to avoid a hard border.
There could also be mechanisms to cooperate on any backstop.
    
    BUT THERE'S STILL A HITCH?
    There's three.
    
    SNAG ONE
    The EU sees May's ""all-UK"" backstop, keeping all of Britain
inside the EU customs union, as a dodge to grab unfair advantage
by giving a special deal intended for a small, troubled province
to Europe's third-biggest economy. It will insist on tough talks
after Brexit to limit Britain's access to the EU single market,
even if it keeps customs ties that keep Ireland's border open.
    
    SNAG TWO
    Brussels still wants a ""Northern Ireland-only"" backstop --
in case trade talks fail. It will play down the risk and may
offer special joint mechanisms to oversee how the backstop
works. But it's still a problem for May. Her Belfast allies have
threatened to vote down her budget next week and there is talk
of a party leadership challenge. So she probably needs to wait.
    
    SNAG THREE
    The deal effectively keeps Britain in the EU customs union
for the foreseeable future. The EU's terms for accepting May's
""all-UK"" solution may prompt accusations she has abandoned a vow
to quit the customs union quickly in order to strike trade deals
with other countries. EU negotiators, diplomats say, would play
along with language to help May deny that it's a customs union
-- but she would have a lot of explaining to do on such a deal.
    
    SO WHAT'S NEXT?
    Time will tell. EU officials are waiting to see how May can
handle her domestic problems and are prepared to have to wait
until December for a deal that can then be ratified by both
parliaments. Later than that and there will be more talk of a
""no deal"" in which Britain lurches chaotically out on March 29.

    By Julien Ponthus and Danilo Masoni
    LONDON/MILAN, Oct 23 (Reuters) - European shares fell
sharply on Tuesday as disappointing company results,
particularly in the tech sector and a mix of political worries
including Italy's budget woes piled pressure on markets. 
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <STOXX> benchmark index fell for
its fifth straight day, ending down 1.6 percent at its lowest
level since December 2016, while Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> lost 2.2
percent, also at December 2016 lows.
    Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> dropped 0.9 percent to February
2017 lows after the European Commission rejected the country's
draft budget and asked Rome to submit a new one within three
weeks. [nL8N1X35N0]
    ""The euro zone found no way to staunch its bleeding as
Tuesday went on; in fact, with the European Commission
confirming it was rejecting Italy's budget the region's wounds
only deepened,"" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
    The European tech sector <.SX8P> led sectoral fallers,
shedding 3.7 percent after downbeat updates from Apple <AAPL.O>
chip supplier AMS <AMS.S> and French IT services company Atos
<ATOS.PA>.
    AMS disappointed investors with its fourth quarter forecast,
knocking 26 percent off the value of its shares despite the
Austrian firm winning deals with other smartphone makers.
[nL8N1X25PX] 
     Atos cut its revenue growth forecast for 2018 on Tuesday,
citing disappointing results in Germany and North America and
global economic uncertainty. Its shares fell 22
percent[nL8N1X30X0]    
    Also losing were Sweden's Saab <SAABb.ST>, which announced a
rights issue, and Finnish ship technology and power plant maker
Wartsila <WRT1V.HE>, after a lower-than-expected quarterly
profit. Their shares fell 15 and 7 percent respectively. 
    Among heavy weights, Germany's Bayer <BAYGn.DE> dropped 9.5
percent after a U.S. judge affirmed a verdict against its
Monsanto unit that found Monsanto's glysophate-based
weed-killers caused a man’s terminal cancer. [nL2N1X300J]

 (Adds reaction from Italian prime minister)
    By Alissa de Carbonnel
    STRASBOURG, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission
rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget on Tuesday, saying it
brazenly broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to
submit a new one within three weeks or face disciplinary action.
    Italian bond yields jumped on the unprecedented move by the
EU executive which was exerting for the first time a power
obtained in 2013 after a sovereign debt crisis to send back a
budget of a euro zone country that violates the rulebook.    
    Having recently emerged from the Greek debt debacle that
nearly destroyed the single currency, the EU is concerned about
another possible crisis if debt-laden Italy were to lose market
trust.
    The Commission has previously dealt with France, Spain,
Portugal and past Italian administrations that broke EU fiscal
rules, but none of those violations were as blatant as the
latest Italian budget draft, the Commission said. 
    ""Today, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to
request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,""
Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news
conference. 
    ""The Italian Government is openly and consciously going
against the commitments it made.""
    Yields of Italian benchmark 10-year bonds <IT10YT=TWEB>
surged on the news to 3.57 percent in the afternoon from 3.42
early on Tuesday.
    Rome will now have to send a new draft budget that would cut
the structural deficit, which excludes one-offs and business
cycle swings, by 0.6 percent of GDP, rather than increase it by
0.8 points as in the current plan, the Commission said.
    
    ITALY DEFIANT
    In a letter to the Commission on Monday, Italy acknowledged
that the draft violated EU rules, but said it would stick to its
guns. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio responded to the
Commission rejection by calling for ""respect"" for Italians.
    ""This is the first Italian budget that the EU doesn't like.
I am not surprised. This is the first Italian budget that was
written in Rome and not in Brussels,"" Di Maio said on Facebook.
    Speaking during a trip to Russia, Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte said he expected ""frank and constructive"" discussions with
Brussels over the fiscal package, adding that plans to hike the
deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP ""won't be touched at the moment"".
    A spokeswoman for the economy ministry in Rome defended the
expansionary budget and said Italy remained convinced that the
only way to cut public debt was by boosting economic growth.
[nR1N1VZ02O]
    Italy has the second highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU
after Greece, at 131.2 percent in 2017, and the highest debt
servicing costs in Europe. But it believes additional spending
through a higher deficit would boost growth, helping reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio.
    The Commission believes Italy's growth assumptions are
overly optimistic making the debt reduction plan questionable.
    ""Experience has shown time and again that higher fiscal
deficits and debt do not bring lasting growth. And excessive
debt makes your economy more vulnerable to future crisis,""
Dombrovskis said.
    Unless Rome changes the deficit assumptions, the Commission
said it would start disciplinary steps, called the excessive
deficit procedure.
    Under EU law, Italy should cut its public debt every year by
1/20 of the difference between 60 percent of GDP and its current
size, counted on average over three years -- in Italy's case
meaning several percent of GDP a year.
    The excessive deficit procedure can lead to fines of up to
0.2 percent of GDP if recommendations to cut the deficit and
debt are ignored.

    COPENHAGEN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Howard Wilkinson, the

before the European Parliament, his lawyer said.
    Danske reported last month that 200 billion euros ($235
billion) of payments moved through its Estonian branch between
2007 and 2015. It said many of the transactions it had analysed
appeared suspicious. [nL8N1W51FB]
    The European Parliament said this month it would invite
Wilkinson, a British trader in Danske Bank's Estonia office at
the time, to testify on Nov. 21 before its special committee on
financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance. 
    Danish parliamentarians had also asked him to testify.
    ""Mr. Wilkinson has agreed to testify before the Danish and
European Parliaments,"" U.S. attorney Stephen M. Kohn, who
represents Wilkinson, said in a statement emailed to Reuters
late on Tuesday.
    A report in Wall Street Journal on Tuesday detailed how
Wilkinson uncovered the large scandal, which has led Danske
Bank's former chief executive Thomas Borgen to resign and almost
halved Danske Bank share price since February.

    By Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Even as British Prime Minister
Theresa May battles critics in her own party, she may be closing
in on a Brexit deal which has been stymied by arguments over the
Irish border. Here's how:
    
    IS A DEAL POSSIBLE?
    It might be almost done. Negotiators on both sides thought
they may have cracked it 10 days ago, EU diplomats told Reuters
[nL8N1WV2RY][nL8N1WV2RY]. The stumbling block seemed to be May
calculating that an EU demand for a special ""backstop"" clause
for Northern Ireland could not win support from her own party
and allies in parliament -- at least not just for the moment.
    
    WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
    Both sides want to avoid a ""hard border"" on the island of
Ireland -- customs posts that could reignite violence against
British rule. Britain says Brexit won't mean physical customs
checks. The EU says it might -- and so it wants London to sign a
treaty clause that could leave Northern Ireland inside the EU
customs space. May and pro-British Belfast allies reject that as
dividing the province from the mainland. Instead, May wants the
EU to let all of the UK stay in the customs area for a time.
    
    AND THE SOLUTION?
    The EU has tried to ramp up assurances that its ""Northern
Ireland-only"" backstop will not be triggered. Those assurances
had previously been simply that a political declaration on the
future EU-UK relationship, due to be agreed this year alongside
the withdrawal treaty that would smooth Britain's March exit,
would state that a way would be found to avoid customs posts. 
    But, EU sources tell Reuters, negotiations this month saw
the EU offer to strengthen that idea in the withdrawal treaty
itself, bending an EU ""red line"" about pre-empting trade talks
as part of an overall package deal to break the deadlock.
    They also offered to extend the treaty's transition period,
when nothing will change, by a year to the end of 2021 to help
ensure that a customs deal is ready to avoid a hard border.
There could also be mechanisms to cooperate on any backstop.

    ROME, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italy will not change its 2019
budget, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday
after the European Commission rejected the government's fiscal
plan and gave it three weeks to present a new one.
    In a radio interview with RTL 102.5, Salvini insisted the
expansionary budget, which raises the deficit next year to 2.4
percent of gross domestic product from a targeted 1.8 percent
this year, was the only way to lower the public debt.
    ""Italians come first ... Italy no longer wants to be a
servant to silly rules,"" said Salvini, who leads the right-wing
League party that governs with the anti-establishment 5-Star
Movement.
    The Commission called on Rome to present a new draft budget
that cuts the structural deficit, which excludes one-offs and
business cycle swings, by 0.6 percent of GDP, rather than
increase it by 0.8 points as in the current plan.
    The EU executive was exerting for the first time a power
obtained in 2013 after a sovereign debt crisis, to send back a
budget of a euro zone country it says violates the rulebook.
    Salvini said in order to boost the economy and lower the
debt as a proportion of GDP Italy had to ""do the opposite"" of
previous governments whose fiscal plans had been more acceptable
to Brussels.
    Italy's public debt stood at 131.2 percent of GDP at the end
of last year, the highest ratio in the eurozone after Greece's.
    Despite his defiant tone on the budget, Salvini said Italy's
membership of the single currency was not in question.
    ""I don't want to leave euro or leave the European Union,"" he
said.
    In a wide-ranging interview, Salvini also said he had
evidence that France was taking immigrants across the border and
depositing them in Italy, and that this could be part of an
attempt to destabilize the Italian government.

    By Alastair Macdonald
    BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Even as British Prime Minister
Theresa May battles critics in her own party, she may be closing
in on a Brexit deal which has been stymied by arguments over the
Irish border. Here's how:
    
    IS A DEAL POSSIBLE?
    It might be almost done. Negotiators on both sides thought
they may have cracked it 10 days ago, EU diplomats told Reuters
[nL8N1WV2RY][nL8N1WV2RY]. The stumbling block seemed to be May
calculating that an EU demand for a special ""backstop"" clause
for Northern Ireland could not win support from her own party
and allies in parliament -- at least not just for the moment.
    
    WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
    Both sides want to avoid a ""hard border"" on the island of
Ireland -- customs posts that could reignite violence against
British rule. Britain says Brexit won't mean physical customs
checks. The EU says it might -- and so it wants London to sign a
treaty clause that could leave Northern Ireland inside the EU
customs space. May and pro-British Belfast allies reject that as
dividing the province from the mainland. Instead, May wants the
EU to let all of the UK stay in the customs area for a time.
    
    AND THE SOLUTION?
    The EU has tried to ramp up assurances that its ""Northern
Ireland-only"" backstop will not be triggered. Those assurances
had previously been simply that a political declaration on the
future EU-UK relationship, due to be agreed this year alongside
the withdrawal treaty that would smooth Britain's March exit,
would state that a way would be found to avoid customs posts. 
    But, EU sources tell Reuters, negotiations this month saw
the EU offer to strengthen that idea in the withdrawal treaty
itself, bending an EU ""red line"" about pre-empting trade talks
as part of an overall package deal to break the deadlock.
    They also offered to extend the treaty's transition period,
when nothing will change, by a year to the end of 2021 to help
ensure that a customs deal is ready to avoid a hard border.
There could also be mechanisms to cooperate on any backstop.
    
    BUT THERE'S STILL A HITCH?
    There's three.
    
    SNAG ONE
    The EU sees May's ""all-UK"" backstop, keeping all of Britain
inside the EU customs union, as a dodge to grab unfair advantage
by giving a special deal intended for a small, troubled province
to Europe's third-biggest economy. It will insist on tough talks
after Brexit to limit Britain's access to the EU single market,
even if it keeps customs ties that keep Ireland's border open.
    
    SNAG TWO
    Brussels still wants a ""Northern Ireland-only"" backstop --
in case trade talks fail. It will play down the risk and may
offer special joint mechanisms to oversee how the backstop
works. But it's still a problem for May. Her Belfast allies have
threatened to vote down her budget next week and there is talk
of a party leadership challenge. So she probably needs to wait.
    
    SNAG THREE
    The deal effectively keeps Britain in the EU customs union
for the foreseeable future. The EU's terms for accepting May's
""all-UK"" solution may prompt accusations she has abandoned a vow
to quit the customs union quickly in order to strike trade deals
with other countries. EU negotiators, diplomats say, would play
along with language to help May deny that it's a customs union
-- but she would have a lot of explaining to do on such a deal.
    
    SO WHAT'S NEXT?
    Time will tell. EU officials are waiting to see how May can
handle her domestic problems and are prepared to have to wait
until December for a deal that can then be ratified by both
parliaments. Later than that and there will be more talk of a
""no deal"" in which Britain lurches chaotically out on March 29.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)


Fitch Ratings-London-October 24: Fitch Ratings says ECB purchases of Eurozone 
sovereign debt have far outweighed net issuance since 2015, raising the risk of 
increased bond market volatility as quantitative easing (QE) comes to an end. QE 
purchases by the ECB have played a key role in absorbing the increase in 
Eurozone government debt since the beginning of 2015 and their scheduled 
termination in December 2018 will require private sector investors to fill the 
gap. 

The scale of the forthcoming shift in market conditions is highlighted by the 
latest chart of the month from Fitch's economics team, which shows the 
cumulative increase in the stock of government debt securities since the end of 
2014 broken down by type of creditor: the central bank, other domestic creditors 
(including financial institutions) and non-residents. It shows that QE has more 
than covered the increase in sovereign debt during the QE period by a factor of 
1.5 in Italy, France and Spain, while in Germany QE purchases have accompanied a 
fall in the overall stock of debt outstanding.

title=""DC-805 FR_Chart_QE and Net Issuance 1"" width=""700"" height=""534"" 
scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;"" 
allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

The cumulative purchases made by the central banks of Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain have, in aggregate, amounted to almost 3 times as much as the increase in 
those four countries' aggregate stock of debt since the end of 2014. The 
corollary of this has been a reduction in holdings by other domestic investors 
and (with the exception of Spain) by non-residents. 

Central banks' share of total government debt has increased manifold since the 
start of QE, with the largest being in Germany; the increase in the Bundesbank 
share has been 16pp since the start of QE. The Bank of Italy's share of 
government debt today stands at close to 20% after an increase of 14pp. 

ECB QE has likely played a significant part in the compression of global yields 
(see our August's chart of the month), but the impact on Eurozone bond yields 
has been more powerful and direct. Arguably the QE 'distortion' to German yields 
has been the strongest given shrinking aggregate supply, raising the risk of 
higher Bund yields when QE ends. But bond spreads over Bunds could also see 
upward pressure as the search for yield unwinds and net issuance remains 
positive.

    * Italian yields surge on Commission rejection
    * Italy defiant, deputy PM Di Maio calls for respect
    * Commission rejection unprecedented
    * Rome has three weeks to revise 2019 draft
    * If Italy does not comply, EU will start disciplinary steps

    By Alissa de Carbonnel
    STRASBOURG, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission
rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget on Tuesday, saying it
brazenly broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to
submit a new one within three weeks or face disciplinary action.
    Italian bond yields jumped on the unprecedented move by the
EU executive which was exerting for the first time a power
obtained in 2013 after a sovereign debt crisis to send back a
budget of a euro zone country that violates the rulebook.    
    Having recently emerged from the Greek debt debacle that
nearly destroyed the single currency, the EU is concerned about
another possible crisis if debt-laden Italy were to lose market
trust.
    The Commission has previously dealt with France, Spain,
Portugal and past Italian administrations that broke EU fiscal
rules, but none of those violations were as blatant as the
latest Italian budget draft, the Commission said. 
    ""Today, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to
request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,""
Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news
conference. 
    ""The Italian Government is openly and consciously going
against the commitments it made.""
    Yields of Italian benchmark 10-year bonds <IT10YT=TWEB>
surged on the news to 3.57 percent in the afternoon from 3.42
early on Tuesday.
    Rome will now have to send a new draft budget that would cut
the structural deficit, which excludes one-offs and business
cycle swings, by 0.6 percent of GDP, rather than increase it by
0.8 points as in the current plan, the Commission said.
    
    ITALY DEFIANT
    In a letter to the Commission on Monday, Italy acknowledged
that the draft violated EU rules, but said it would stick to its
guns. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio responded to the
Commission rejection by calling for ""respect"" for Italians.
    ""This is the first Italian budget that the EU doesn't like.
I am not surprised. This is the first Italian budget that was
written in Rome and not in Brussels,"" Di Maio said on Facebook.
    Speaking during a trip to Russia, Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte said he expected ""frank and constructive"" discussions with
Brussels over the fiscal package, adding that plans to hike the
deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP ""won't be touched at the moment"".
    A spokeswoman for the economy ministry in Rome defended the
expansionary budget and said Italy remained convinced that the
only way to cut public debt was by boosting economic growth.
[nR1N1VZ02O]
    Italy has the second highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU
after Greece, at 131.2 percent in 2017, and the highest debt
servicing costs in Europe. But it believes additional spending
through a higher deficit would boost growth, helping reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio.
    The Commission believes Italy's growth assumptions are
overly optimistic making the debt reduction plan questionable.
    ""Experience has shown time and again that higher fiscal
deficits and debt do not bring lasting growth. And excessive
debt makes your economy more vulnerable to future crisis,""
Dombrovskis said.
    Unless Rome changes the deficit assumptions, the Commission
said it would start disciplinary steps, called the excessive
deficit procedure.
    Under EU law, Italy should cut its public debt every year by
1/20 of the difference between 60 percent of GDP and its current
size, counted on average over three years -- in Italy's case
meaning several percent of GDP a year.
    The excessive deficit procedure can lead to fines of up to
0.2 percent of GDP if recommendations to cut the deficit and
debt are ignored.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and the bloc's
government bond yields dropped on Wednesday after data showed
business growth in the single currency area lost far more
momentum than expected, as trade tensions and worries over Italy
overshadow the economy. 
    A survey showed euro zone business growth decelerated faster
than anticipated as the final quarter of 2018 began, dragged
down by waning orders that dented confidence, a survey showed on
Wednesday. [nL9N1T2014]    
    ""The flash PMI (data) for October gives a first glimpse on
where the euro zone economy is heading. And the picture is not
terrific,"" ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said in a note. 
    The data for the bloc as a whole came after French and
German business surveys also undershot expectations when
released earlier. [nL9N1T2012] [nL9N1T2013]
    The euro extended its losses on the back of the figures,
falling half a percent to $1.1417 <EUR=>, its lowest since Aug.
20. It was already down about 0.4 percent after the German and
French surveys. 
    Germany's 10-year bond yield dropped to the day's low of
0.39 percent <DE10YT=RR>, down 2.4 bps on day, while other
high-grade euro zone bond yields were also lower. <FR10YT=RR>   
 
    ""It's true that the wider euro zone figures were below
expectations, and the fact that the services sector is falling
as well is a bit troublesome,"" said Natixis strategist Cyril
Regnat. 
    ""We keep having downside risks on growth ... I do feel the
ECB will say the trade war issue and global downside risks are
gently weighing on confidence, but their statement about growth
should probably remain unchanged,"" Regnat said.   
    The European Central Bank is due to meet on Thursday, when
its president Mario Draghi may hint at how concerns over Italy's
budget and the equity market downturns will affect monetary
policy.
    ""Besides risk sentiment, economic sentiment should be key
today as both can influence the tone at tomorrow's ECB meeting,""
Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients.
    
    DIFFICULT PERIOD 
    Italian government bonds edged off the previous day's highs
as a recovery in European stocks improved risk sentiment, though
analysts warned the country has a difficult period coming up.
    Italian borrowing costs were down between 1.5 and 2 basis
points across the curve, down from the weekly highs they reached
on Tuesday after the European Union rejected Italy's draft
budget for 2019. [nR1N1W500C] <IT2YT=RR>, <IT10YT=RR>
    Analysts attribute the recovery to an upswing in risk
sentiment following a late rally in Wall Street and a
corresponding boost for European shares Wednesday morning, after
a difficult few weeks for the stock market. 
    ""The slight improvement in risk sentiment in equity markets
could be feeding through, but it's going to be a tough week for
the (Italy/Germany) spread,"" said ING strategist Martin Van
Vliet. ""Many investors are going to remain on the sidelines
until the S&P decision.""
    S&P Global is due on Friday to review Italy's credit rating,
currently at BBB with a stable outlook.
    Analysts expect a downgrade, but are divided on whether this
will only be for the outlook, moving to ""negative"", or whether
the agency will drop Italy's credit rating by a notch to BBB-,
the lowest investment-grade rating.

    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The euro skidded more than half a
percent to its weakest since Aug. 20 on Wednesday after signs
that economic growth could be slowing across the euro zone.
    Euro zone business growth slowed much faster than expected
this month, a widely-watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)
survey showed. [nL8N1X42E4]
    German private-sector growth slowed to its lowest level in
more than three years, and manufacturing in France hit a
25-month low, according to other surveys. [nL9N1T2013]
[nL9N1T2012] 
    The single currency, earlier trading flat, dropped more than
to as low as $1.1402 <EUR=> after the surveys were published.
    The euro also fell 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.1372 francs <EURCHF=>, a two-week low.
    ""Particularly the German PMI was disappointing ... The
environment for the euro is getting more difficult,"" said Thu
Lan Nguyen, a Frankfurt-based strategist at Commerzbank,
pointing to a dispute over Italy's spending plans and concerns
about the bloc's growth outlook.
    The European Central Bank holds its monetary policy meeting
on Thursday, and investors will be looking for any comments
about the deepening row between the European Union and Italy
over Rome's budget.
    Weakness in the single currency supported the dollar, which
rose 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies to 96.380
<.DXY>.
    The Japanese yen - often bought when broader markets slide -
gave up its earlier gains, suggesting some renewed demand for
risk-taking as stock markets rebounded on Wednesday.     
    The yen <JPY=> edged 0.2 percent lower to 112.65 yen per
dollar, but remains almost two percent up since Oct. 4. 
    Big falls in stock prices have shaken foreign exchange
markets this week, with the yen the main gainer, as investors
weigh up whether equity weakness is a major correction or just
another wobble in a nearly decade-long bull-market run.
    The S&P 500 <.SPX> is on course for its worst performance
since at least August 2015.
    ""There are good reasons why you would want to be cautious,""
said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon,
citing the Italian budget and U.S. President Donald Trump's
criticism of the Federal Reserve over interest rate rises.
    Worries about Italy, fears about ebbing world growth, global
trade wars and political tensions between Saudi Arabia and the
West are spooking investors.
    Sterling fell 0.6 percent to $1.2904 <GBP=>, a six-week low,
amid intensifying concerns about whether the UK can get a Brexit
agreement. [nL8N1X36GK]
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> edged marginally lower to
C$1.3095 ahead of an expected Bank of Canada interest rate hike
later on Wednesday.[nL2N1X30GS]
    The Australian dollar <AUD=> stood at $0.7090, unchanged on
the day, after earlier finding supported from improved sentiment
in Asia, Australia's key export markets.

467,1648,2152,5247,b6b727150d3bc629688f1e9ccd757810,Europe hit by steel import surge from U.S. tariffs -industry body,2018-10-24 21:40:32,EUR,0.0,2018-10-24 21:41:41,"{'USD': 'Negative', 'EUR': 'Negative'}","    By Philip Blenkinsop
    BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Steel imports into Europe have
risen sharply as a result of U.S. tariffs, particularly from
Turkey, threatening European steelmakers as demand growth in the
continent slows, European steel association Eurofer said on
Wednesday.
    Eurofer said in its quarterly review it expected European
Union apparent steel consumption, a reflection of supply to the
market, would rise by 2.2 percent this year and by 1.1 percent
in 2019.
    Trade frictions with the United States and cooling global
demand had weakened prospects for EU steel users, Eurofer said.
    U.S. President Donald Trump imposed import tariffs of 25
percent on steel from most countries from March 23. It added 
Canada, Mexico and the European Union to the list on June 1 and
doubled the rate to 50 percent for Turkey in August.
    Karl Tachelet, Eurofer's trade director, said the U.S.
tariffs had led to a surge in U.S. steel prices of some 40
percent, meaning European producers could still sell some steel
there.
    ""The question for us is how long are the U.S. prices going
to stay that high. There will be some correction and when prices
go down the 25 percent will be more prohibitive,"" he continued.
    The main impact to date was that steel that might have gone
to the United States was being redirected to Europe. 
    Turkey, facing a 50 percent tariff, could no longer
realistically sell across the Atlantic, while slowing domestic
growth [nL8N1W6390] left it with more steel to sell.
    ""They are pushing a lot of volumes into the EU market at any
cost,"" said Jeroen Vermeij, director of economic studies at
Eurofer.
    Russia, a traditional exporter of steel to Turkey, was
likewise, needing an outlet for its production, Eurofer said.
    In the third quarter 2018, Eurofer said steel consumption
had risen by just 0.6 percent, but imports increased by 10
percent, meaning EU mills were at best only able to deliver the
same amount of steel as last year. Imports now make up some 25
percent of the EU market.
    Imports from Turkey and Russia increased by most - from
Turkey by 57 percent in the first nine months and from Russia by
56 percent.
    The European Union did put in place safeguards to limit
steel imports in the light of U.S. tariffs [nL8N1UE1VF]
    Eurofer said it was broadly content with the system, but the
quotas were global and that country-specific quotas should apply
to major exporters to help stabilise the market.

 (Adds comment from Porsche Automobil Holding SE and the
Stuttgart court)
    FRANKFURT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - A German court on Wednesday
ordered Porsche Automobil Holding SE <PSHG_p.DE> to pay
shareholders 47.2 million euros ($53.8 million) in compensation
for violating disclosure rules over an emissions scandal at its
main investment Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>.
    Shareholders who held Porsche SE stock between May 23, 2014,
and Sept. 22, 2015, were entitled to be compensated for the
share price declines caused by Volkswagen's (VW) cheating of
U.S. diesel emissions tests, the Stuttgart court said. 
    Porsche SE, which holds a 30.8 percent stake in VW and 52
percent of voting rights at the carmaker, said it would appeal
the ruling and that it was confident a higher court would
overturn the lower court's findings.
    ""Porsche SE is convinced that the lawsuits are without
merit,"" it said. 
    Porsche SE shareholders sued the company for failing to
inform its investors in a timely manner about VW's diesel
emissions cheating, which has cost the automaker more than 27
billion euros in fines and vehicle refits. 
    At the time U.S. regulators caught VW using illegal software
to rig diesel engine tests, the carmaker was headed by Martin
Winterkorn, who was also CEO of Porsche SE.
    Law firm Nieding & Barth said the pension fund for the city
of Wolverhampton in central England was awarded 3.2 million
euros in damages by the Stuttgart court.
    Law firm TILP said Porsche SE was asked to pay 44 million
euros to other shareholders.
    The verdict is not enforceable yet, given Porsche SE's right
to appeal, TILP said.
    VW is also being sued by investors for allegedly breaching
disclosure violations, which the company denies.

    NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar surged nearly 1
percent against the euro on Wednesday to its strongest since
Aug. 20 after European data signaled that economic growth could
be flagging across the euro zone.
    Euro zone business growth slowed more than expected this
month, a widely watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey
showed. German private-sector growth fell to its lowest in more
than three years, and manufacturing in France hit a 25-month
low, according to other surveys. [nL9N1T2014][nL9N1T2013]
[nL9N1T2012] 
    The market is also concerned about an escalating U.S.-China
trade war, a heated debt dispute in Italy and the prospect of
tightening financial conditions. Against the dollar, the euro
fell as much as 0.79 percent, breaking below the $1.14 level and
heading toward its biggest daily loss since late September
<EUR=>.
    The European reports ""came in weaker than expected and
suggest that some of the softness we saw in Q2 and Q3 may not be
as temporary as people were assuming,"" said Daniel Katzive, head
of foreign exchange strategy for North American at BNP Paribas. 
     ""Even though the U.S. is starting to show some cracks and
vulnerability to global trade and geopolitical stresses, Europe
is still more vulnerable from an economic perspective."" 
    Weakness in the single currency supported the dollar index,
which rose 0.4 percent against a basket of six rival currencies
to 96.296 <.DXY>.
    The euro also fell 0.4 percent against the Swiss franc to
1.137 francs <EURCHF=>, a two-week low.
    The European Central Bank holds its monetary policy meeting
on Thursday, and investors will be looking for any comments
about the deepening row between the European Union and Italy
over Rome's budget.
    The Canadian dollar fell by 0.76 percent on Wednesday
morning after the country's central bank raised interest rates
as expected and said more hikes would be needed to keep
inflation in check <CAD=>.
    The Bank of Canada - which has now lifted rates five times
since July 2017 as the economy strengthens - tweaked its
standard language on future hikes, dropping previous references
to the gradual pace of tightening. [nBCLOLEE2T]
    The Japanese yen, often bought when broader markets slide, 
gave up its earlier gains, suggesting some renewed demand for
risk-taking as stock markets rebounded on Wednesday. The yen
<JPY=> weakened to 112.51 yen per dollar, but remains almost two
percent stronger since Oct. 4. 
    Sterling fell 0.39 percent to $1.293 <GBP=> amid
intensifying concerns about whether the UK can reach a Brexit
agreement. [nL8N1X36GK]

    PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - France could impose sanctions on
Saudi Arabia if its intelligence services establish the kingdom
is behind the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, government
spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on Wednesday.
    France has been relatively guarded so far in reacting to
Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul given its
close diplomatic ties with Riyadh and commercial relations
spanning energy, finance and arms.
    ""As long as the facts have not been clearly established, and
corroborated by our information services, we will not take any
decision,"" said Griveaux.
    ""But on the other hand, once light has been shed on the
matter and has been corroborated by our services, based on the
hypothesis that Saudi Arabia's responsibility has been proved,
then we would draw the necessary conclusions and impose
appropriate sanctions,"" he said.
    It was the first time Paris had publicly brought up the
possibility of sanctions, although diplomats cautioned that
there would not be any ""hasty"" decision and there were concerns
over harming France's political relationship with the kingdom.
    Griveaux added that any sanctions move would not solely
involve limiting arms sales. He did not elaborate.
    Khashoggi's death on Oct. 2 has triggered global outrage.
Saudi officials have acknowledged that Saudi operatives were
responsible for his death, but the explanation around how he was
killed and why have shifted. [nL8N1X36U1]
    ""We won't take any hasty decision on the future of our
strategic relationship,"" a French presidential source added.
    ""France's partnership with Saudi Arabia is a long term one,
which does not deal only with cooperation over defence matters,
the partnership is also economic, cultural, and in the area of
energy,"" the source said.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the killing a
""monstrosity"" on Monday and vowed to halt German arms exports to
Riyadh until the case is cleared up. 
    But Macron on Tuesday refused to take questions about
halting arms sales. [nL8N1X3636]
    From 2008-17, Saudi Arabia was the second-biggest purchaser
of French arms, with deals totalling more than 11 billion euros.

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Virginia Furness
    LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell and the euro zone's
government bond yields dropped on Wednesday after data showed
business growth in the single currency area lost more momentum
than expected, as trade tensions and worries over Italy
overshadow the economy.
    The bid for quality assets gathered pace after the U.S.
market open, with most of the single currency area's bond yields
falling further as equity markets were pushed lower by bearish
sentiment over trade conflicts, concerns about Italy's budget
and criticism of Saudi Arabia over the killing of a journalist.
[nL2N1X413L]
    Euro zone business growth decelerated faster than expected
as the final quarter of 2018 began, dragged down by waning
orders that dented confidence, according to a purchasing
managers survey released on Wednesday. [nL9N1T2014]
    ""The flash PMI for October gives a first glimpse on where
the euro zone economy is heading. And the picture is not
terrific,"" ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said in a note. 
    The data for the single currency area came after French and
German business surveys released earlier also undershot
expectations. [nL9N1T2012] [nL9N1T2013].
    Germany's 10-year bond yields fell three bps to a low of
0.39 percent <DE10YT=RR>. Other high-grade euro zone bond yields
also fell with France's 10-year yield hit a five-week low of
0.76 percent <FR10YT=RR> while Spain's 10-year bond yield fell
four basis points to a two-week low of 1.62 percent. 
    The European Central Bank is due to meet on Thursday, when
its president, Mario Draghi, may hint at how concern over
Italy's budget and equity market downturns will affect monetary
policy.
    ""Besides risk sentiment, economic sentiment should be key
today as both can influence the tone at tomorrow's ECB meeting,""
Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients.
    
    DIFFICULT PERIOD
    Italian government bond yields rose as much as seven basis
points in late trade on Wednesday as a recovery in European
stocks proved short lived, and Italian banking stocks fell.
[nS8N1RT01S] 
    Italy's sovereign yields rose across the curve, extending
the weekly highs they reached on Tuesday after the European
Union rejected the country's draft budget for 2019. [nR1N1W500C]
    Its five-year government bond yields were seven bps higher
on the day to 2.97 percent, while its 10-year bond yields rose
four bps to 3.62 percent <IT2YT=RR>, <IT10YT=RR>. 
    One analyst said selling in Italian bonds was led by the
Italian equity market, which was down around 1.69 percent
<.FTMIB>. Others said comments by Italian Deputy Prime Minister
Luigi Di Maio on the so-called ""golden power"" rules did not
help. [nS8N1RT01S]
    The rules allow the government to veto strategic decisions
such as asset sales and mergers at businesses deemed to be of
strategic national importance.
    ""The government is doing things that aren't that business
friendly,"" said Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank.
    Investors are also cautious on Italian bonds ahead of a
ratings review by S&P Global on Friday. S&P is due to review
Italy's credit rating, currently at BBB with a stable outlook.
    Analysts expect a downgrade, but are divided on whether this
will only be lowering the outlook to ""negative"", or whether
Italy's credit rating will be cut to BBB-, the lowest
investment-grade rating.

    MOSCOW, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte said on Wednesday that EU sanctions against Russia had to
come to an end, but declined to say if his government was ready
to veto any further rollover of the economic curbs.
    Russia has been subjected to European Union sanctions since
the 2014 Ukraine crisis and Rome has long urged a relaxation of
the penalties on the grounds that they have hit Italian firms
trading with Moscow.
    The latest round of curbs on doing business with Russian
banking, financial and energy sectors were renewed in June but
expire at the end of January and are up for discussion in
Brussels.
    ""For Italy, sanctions are never an end, they are an
instrument that must be overcome as soon as possible,"" Conte
said during a joint news conference with Russian President
Vladimir Putin. 
    However, he declined to say if Rome was ready to veto any
sanction renewal. ""Italy would like to persuade other European
countries that the only way forward is through dialogue.""
    Italy is already locked in battle with EU allies over the
government's contested 2019 budget, which the European
Commission has rejected, saying it breaks deficit rules. 
    Financial markets have also reacted negatively to the
budget, with bond yields rising to multi-year highs as investors
fear for the sustainability of Italy's debt mountain.
    Conte denied a suggestion that he had asked Russia to buy
Italian bonds in an effort to calm markets.
    ""I did not come here to ask Putin to buy Italian securities
through the sovereign fund. If a sovereign fund or the central
bank were to make such a decision, they would do so because it
is convenient, and a good deal,"" Conte said.

    BUCHAREST, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Romania's justice minister on
Wednesday demanded the prosecutor general's dismissal, accusing
him of exceeding his authority in a move that could heighten
concerns in Brussels about democratic values in some eastern EU
member states.
    Other recent steps by Romania's ruling Social Democrats to
change the justice system and replace senior judicial officials
have triggered massive street protests, and sparked worries
about the rule of law at the European Commission and among
diplomats.
    Justice Minister Tudorel Toader read a summary of a 20-point
report that he had compiled, calling for Prosecutor General
Augustin Lazar to be fired on the grounds that he was
responsible for ""acts and facts intolerable to the rule of law.""
    Lazar is the last major figure in an anti-corruption drive
that has won praise from Brussels for exposing high-level
corruption, including the theft of EU funds. [nL8N1WZ6DD] 
    He condemned Toader's bid to oust him. ""(This) is the way
that the executive, by way of the justice minister, demonstrates
its understanding about respect for prosecutors' independence,""
he told reporters.
    Lazar oversees thousands of prosecutors, including
anti-organised crime unit DIICOT and anti-corruption unit DNA. 
    The DIICOT leader's mandate has expired, and the head of the
DNA, Laura Codruta Kovesi, was fired in July after a performance
review similar to Lazar's. Critics say their potential
replacements might be soft on crime.
    Under Romanian law, the president must sign off on petitions
to dismiss chief prosecutors, which are requested by the justice
minister and also need approval from a judicial watchdog.
    However, the Constitutional Court ruled earlier this year
that the president does not have the right to oppose such a
request from the justice minister. As a result, President Klaus
Iohannis had to sack the DNA's Kovesi in July. [nL5N1T14PC] 
    Iohannis will be limited to assessing the legality of the
procedure. Analysts have said the constitutional court's ruling
increased the government's power over prosecutors.
    Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's
most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system
under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.
    Anti-corruption prosecutors have convicted thousands of
public officials, including lawmakers and ministers. 
    Among them is Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea who has a
two-year suspended jail sentence in a vote-rigging case. He was
also sentenced to three and a half years in jail in a separate
abuse of office case. He denies all charges and has appealed.
    The European Commission, which is already seeking sanctions
against Poland and Hungary for flouting democratic values, fears
Romania is following suit. It is due to release its latest
justice monitoring report on Romania in November.

 (Adds Macron statement)
    By John Irish
    PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it could
impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia if its intelligence services
find the kingdom was behind the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, even
as Paris worked to maintain important business and strategic
ties with Riyadh.
    Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman promised on Wednesday
that Khashoggi's killers would be brought to justice, in his
first public comments since the journalist's murder provoked
international condemnation. [nL8N1X45HK]
    French reaction has been relatively guarded to date, as
Paris tried to retain its influence with Riyadh and protect
commercial relations spanning energy, finance and arms.
    But President Emmanuel Macron told King Salman that France,
in coordination with partners, could take action against those
held responsible for the murder, the presidency said in a
statement.[nL8N1X47YE]
    Macron expressed profound outrage during a phone
conversation with Salman, it said, adding that the president had
asked the king that the circumstances around Khashoggi's death
be fully disclosed.
    The two leaders also discussed the situation in Yemen and
Syria, the Elysee palace said. 
    ""As long as the facts have not been clearly established, and
corroborated by our information services, we will not take any
decision,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said earlier
on Wednesday.
    ""On the other hand, once light has been shed on the matter
and has been corroborated by our services, based on the
hypothesis that Saudi Arabia's responsibility has been proved,
then we would draw the necessary conclusions and impose
appropriate sanctions,"" he said.
    Any steps would not just involve sanctions on arms sales he
said, without elaborating.
    Earlier, a French presidency source said there would be no
""hasty decision"".
    Other major Western allies of Saudi Arabia have already
spoken out. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that
the crown prince may be behind Khashoggi's death. German
Chancellor Angela Merkel has called his killing a ""monstrosity""
and vowed to halt German arms exports. 
    Britain, like France a major weapons supplier to the
kingdom, has said an explanation by Riyadh that Khashoggi died
in a fight in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was not credible.
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday Britain would
prevent all suspects in his death from entering the UK.
    
    BALANCING ACT
    A senior French diplomat acknowledged Macron was treading a
thin line in pursuing his long-stated policy of avoiding taking 
sides between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran.
    ""We're a bit in the shit because of this,"" he said,
referring to the Khashoggi furore. ""We have an important
partnership, but while we never considered Saudi to be the
cradle of human rights, this is serious. It can't be ignored.
There will be consequences, but we need to be prudent.""
    Since coming to power last year, Macron has largely ignored
protests over arms sales he deems vital to jobs and France's
strategic relationships in the region.
    From 2008 to 2017, Saudi Arabia was the second biggest
purchaser of French arms, with deals totalling 11 billion euros
($12.7 billion), including 1.5 billion last year alone. 
    Reflecting the range of French commercial interests in the
region, the head of oil company Total was attending the Future
Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, a meeting boycotted
by a number of his peers in the wake of the Khashoggi killing.
    Macron considers Riyadh vital to help forge a region-wide
peace deal with Iran, as well as an ally in the fight against
Islamist militants from the Middle East to West Africa, and a
rampart against the Muslim Brotherhood.
    ""The sale of weapons is something very political and part of
a long-term vision,"" said Camille Lons, a researcher at the
European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Saudi Arabia is present
across the region, so if there were to be complications in
diplomatic relations it could have an impact on several regional
theatres."" 
    
    ALLIANCE OF YOUTH
    At the heart of Macron's strategy is Mohammed bin Salman,
often referred to as MbS, who has painted himself as a reformer
but is under scrutiny over Khashoggi's death. 
    During a visit to France this year Macron urged detractors
to give time to the 33-year-old leader-in-waiting. [nL8N1RN6ZZ] 
 
    ""The challenge is not to lose MbS. A loss of influence in
the region would cost us much more than the lack of arms sales,""
a French minister said on condition of anonymity.
    Macron has tried to play down the importance of economic
relations and instead played up the strategic partnership.
    ""Paris — while projecting its outward image of a beacon of
liberalism and idealism — is deeply interested in getting even
closer to the current rulers in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,"" said 
Jalel Harchaoui, geopolitics lecturer at Versailles University.
    ""The dominant perception is that both leaders are dynamic
and assertive while the Khashoggi affair is just a temporary
crisis during which no mistakes must be made.""

Marek Mora sees a 50-50 chance that he will vote for another
interest rate hike at the next board meeting on Nov. 1 as he
awaits an update to the central bank staff macroeconomic
forecast to decide, Mora was quoted as saying on Thursday.
    The Czech National Bank (CNB) delivered its third rate hike
in as many policy meetings in September. The key two-week repo
rate <CZCBIR=ECI> now stands at 1.50 percent. [L8N1WX3QV]
    In total, the bank has lifted rates from near zero in six
steps since ending a four-year-old intervention regime keeping
the crown weak in 2017, the most aggressive tightening in the
European Union, as the European Central Bank and others in the
region keep loose policy in place.
    The CNB board will get a quarterly update of the central
bank staff macroeconomic forecast for its meeting on Nov. 1.
    ""I will wait for our new forecast ... Only that will provide
a comprehensive picture of what is appropriate to do with
rates,"" Mora said in an interview published by the Hospodarske
Noviny daily paper.
    ""For me, it is 50-50 now whether to raise rates or keep them
at their current level,"" he said.
    The Czech economy, mainly driven by domestic demand, has
grown at a strong pace, cutting unemployment to the lowest in
the European Union in recent months. However, there are signs of
a moderate slowdown appearing.
    At the same time, the crown <EURCZK=> is trading at weaker
levels than the central bank has predicted, which creates space
for further policy tightening, Mora said.
    ""The crown has not been strengthening so far, because global
factors are weakening it ... It is true that the current
exchange rate, especially towards the euro, allows for further
raising of interest rates,"" he said, adding however that the
loose monetary conditions in the euro zone need to be taken into
consideration.
    ""Hence I would urge caution,"" Mora said.

its financial regulator to make it better able to fight money
laundering, its business minister said on Thursday, as the
country's largest bank, Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>, is embroiled in
a major scandal.
    The scandal involves 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in
payments through Danske's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015,
many of which the bank said in a report last month it thinks are
suspicious.
    The scandal has led the bank's former chief executive Thomas
Borgen to resign and almost halved Danske Bank share price since
February.
    ""Obviously, supervision must be strengthened and conducted
in a different way than it has been done in the period 2007-2015
when we can see that Europe's largest money laundering case was
not detected,"" conservative minister Rasmus Jarlov said on
Facebook early on Thursday.
    He said that a profound evaluation of the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA) had begun and that it would include
inputs from the FSA itself as well as from other stakeholders.
    ""It is a great task, and it must be done thoroughly,"" the
minister said.
    The FSA's handling of the Danske Bank case has been widely
criticised, and the European Union's banking supervisor has
begun an inquiry into it. [nL8N1WO4B0]
    Jarlov said it was crucial that the FSA be given tools to
scrutinise the information it gets from banks more thoroughly.
    ""It seems that supervision largely has been based on the
banks' own assessments of how they themselves think they are
combating money laundering. That is obviously not enough,"" he
said.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Despite trade concerns, evidence
of a weakening euro zone outlook and looming risks like a
no-deal Brexit and an Italian debt crisis, the European Central
Bank looks determined for now to stick to its guns on winding
down stimulus. There seems little doubt that it will keep its
policy on hold at today's rate-setting meeting - the main
questions are about how explicitly it chooses to acknowledge
that the growth outlook is deteriorating. It could, for example,
downgrade the risks to the outlook from broadly balanced to
tilted to the downside. The danger in that, however, would be
that investors might take a change of risk assessment as a sign
of an imminent policy move. The ECB announces its policy
decision at 1145 GMT, followed by Mario Draghi's news conference
at 1230 GMT. 
    NATO allies are due to meet today to hear Washington explain
the thinking behind President Donald Trump's move to quit the
1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which rid Europe
of land-based nuclear missiles. It will be interesting to see
whether the United States's European allies overtly tell
Washington they will not host U.S. missiles on their soil -
something Vladimir Putin has warned would lead to them becoming
targets for Russian missiles. 
    Once more the plotters against British PM Theresa May's
leadership of the Conservative Party failed to come out into the
open at a meeting with her last night, the conclusion of which
was an albeit stage-managed show of loyalty. No one is under any
illusions that the party is happy with her leadership, but the
simple fact is that it has no one out there seen more competent.
The same is true with the country, it seems: An Ipsos MORI poll
on Wednesday showed a record 78 percent of voters lacked
confidence in May to get a good deal from Brussels, ""and nor is
there much evidence that they would have much more confidence in
anyone else"" notes the pollster's head of political research.
    
    MARKETS AT 0655 GMT
    As the global stock markets slide snowballs into one of the
worst months of the past 10 years, attention will now start to
shift back to see whether policymakers can offset the mounting
investor gloom that threatens to feed back into the real
economy, business spending and consumption. The ECB meeting
provides one opportunity to signal any rethink of gradual
monetary policy tightening worldwide, with soured euro business
confidence readings at their lowest in four years this month as
Sino-U.S. trade war fears bite German exporters in particular.
While the ECB is unlikely to alter its late 2019 timeline for
possible interest rate rises, it may sound concerns about the
deterioration in financial market and business sentiment that
could prompt speculation about the pace how it winds down its
bond-buying stimulus programme. The lack of policy ammunition to
guard against another economic downturn, however, is a factor
that unnerves investors in equal measure. While fellow G7 member
the Bank of Canada ploughed ahead with a rate rise on Wednesday
- and signalling more to come - the acceleration of the equity
market selloff on Wall St and worldwide overnight will start to
register more loudly. S&P500 losses of more than 3 percent now
make October so far the worst year for the index in 9 years.
Concerns about deteriorating forward guidance from U.S.
companies hit by President Trump’s trade wars has added to
monetary tightening fears and spreading bear market signals
around the globe. Heavy losses for the technology sector after
warnings from chipmakers such as Texas Instruments and STMicro
saw the Nasdaq lose more than 4 percent and enter formal
correction territory of more than 10 percent losses from this
year’s peaks. The VIX volatility gauge spiked to more than 25
percent. Microsoft regained some of its 5 percent losses after
the bell, however, after decent Q3 results. 
    The broad market selling continued through Asia markets,
with Tokyo’s Nikkei losing almost 4 percent and HK and Seoul
down more than 1 percent. MSCI’s all-country index has now lost
more than 9 percent so far in October to its lowest levels in
over a year and is on course for its worst month since the
height of euro crisis in 2012. MSCI’s emerging markets equity
benchmark, now down almost 27 percent from the peaks of January,
fell to its lowest level since March of 2017. Against a backdrop
of the dire October business sentiment readings and a drop in
the euro zone economic surprise index to its most negative since
May, European stock futures were down more than half a  percent
too. The dollar and U.S. Treasury bonds were all higher amid the
equity market trepidation. Euro/dollar dipped below $1.14
overnight for the first time since mid-August before rebounding
slightly this morning. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered
about 3.10 percent. Emerging market currencies were weaker
across the board. Sterling steady after Wednesday’s losses after
UK PM May appeared to get a positive reception after meeting
with Conservative party lawmakers and following reports she may
face a leadership challenge. Brent crude oil prices steadied
about $75. Turkey’s lira slipped slightly ahead of Turkey’s
central bank policy decision later. 
    A slew of European earnings to keep traders busy with UBS,
AB InBev, and Norwegian Air among those reporting. Results were
looking slightly better for banks, with both Switzerland’s
biggest bank UBS and Britain’s biggest mortgage lender Lloyds
beating profit expectations. Stronger than expected results from
Swiss engineering firm ABB could also encourage investors after
weak earnings from Caterpillar drove a sharp selloff and anxiety
around industrials. On the other hand, with tech particularly in
the spotlight after the Nasdaq had its worst fall since Aug
2011, BE Semiconductor’s results will do nothing to lessen
concerns. The Amsterdam-listed maker of semiconductor assembly
equipment said it saw a nearly 25 percent drop in Q4 revenue due
to weaker market conditions. AB InBev could also sink after
cutting its dividend and reporting in-line Q3 earnings.

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen and Swiss franc
rose on Thursday as investors sought safety following a wave of
selling across stock markets, although moves in currency markets
were modest and suggested investors were far from panicking.
    The euro also gained, recovering from two month lows hit on
Wednesday and ahead of a European Central Bank monetary policy
meeting later on Thursday.
    Asian stocks followed their U.S. counterparts into a sea of
red overnight. The S&P 500 <.SPX> declined for a sixth straight
day as weak forecasts from chipmakers added to concerns about
the impact on earnings from tariffs and a slowdown in China's
economy. [nL2N1X41ON]
    European indexes were set to open sharply lower and the
selloff in October has raised fears of the end of a near-decade
long bull-market.
    ""To a large extent until today there had been a lack of
reaction in the FX markets. We are starting to see this come
through...Now it's really adding up, the fragile macroeconomy
and the political risks,"" said Christin Tuxen, an FX strategist
at Danske Bank.
    However, Tuxen said that the modest size of currency moves
on Thursday reflected that recent data showed a ""loss of
momentum in global growth"" rather than a risk of recession or
something serious enough to spook forex investors.
    The yen rose to as high as 111.82 <JPY=> versus the dollar,
but later gave up most of those gains to trade at 112.100, up
0.1 percent on the day.
    The Swiss franc rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar to 0.9963
<CHF=> but was down marginally against the euro <EURCHF=>.
    The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1417 <EUR=>, away from the
two month lows of $1.1378.
    That left the dollar nursing losses, with the greenback
index off 0.2 percent at 96.241 <.DXY.>
    There were other signs of relative calm in currency markets.
The Australian dollar, often viewed as a bellwether for global
risk, rose 0.2 percent to $0.7078 <AUD=> before flatlining.  
    
    ECB IN FOCUS
    The main event of the day is the ECB meeting, and investors
will be looking for any new guidance on a possible slowdown in
growth across the euro zone as well as the row between Brussels
and Rome over Italy's budget plans. [nL9N1T2012]
    The ECB is not expected to offer any surprises and instead
confirm that the end of quantitative easing next year is on
track, although there is a risk president Mario Draghi sounds
more dovish given recent headwinds.
    ""Euro has limited upside given risk factors such as the
Italian budget, Brexit and more recently the softening economic
activity,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at
NAB.
    ""Mario Draghi will have to acknowledge weakness in the data
and reaffirm that the ECB monetary tightening path is data
dependent.""
    Sterling recovered from six-week lows to $1.2912 <GBP=>, up
0.2 percent on the session.
    British Prime Minister Theresa May received a show of
support from her Conservative Party on Wednesday at a meeting in
parliament, shifting the focus away from talk of an imminent
leadership challenge over her Brexit strategy. [nL8N1X457G]

    ROME, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi
Di Maio on Thursday reiterated his country had no plans to leave
the single currency, but it would not change its 2019 budget
deficit target despite its rejection by the European Commission.
    Di Maio, who is leader of the ruling coalition's 5-Star
Movement, also said in a interview with radio 24 that the
government was monitoring the banking system, which is coming
under stress from the increase in government bond yields.
    ""Markets are not concerned about Italy not respecting the EU
budget rules. Investors are worried about false storytelling
according to which Italy wants to leave the euro and the
European Union. That is not the case,"" said Di Maio.
    He added that the 2019 deficit target of 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product, which Brussels says is too high, should
not be changed.
    Financial markets have reacted negatively to the
expansionary budget, with bond yields rising to multi-year highs
as investors fret over Italy's defiance of EU fiscal rules and
the sustainability of its debt mountain - the highest in the
euro zone after Greece.
    The Italy/Germany bond yield spread on Thursday retreated to
318 basis points from 323 late on Wednesday, its second widest
level since 2013, after Di Maio's remarks and ahead of a meeting
of the European Central Bank. [nL8N1X5222]
    The spike in Italy's debt costs may hurt the value of its
banks' large sovereign holdings and eat into their capital,
Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Wednesday. [nS8N1RT020]
    Di Maio said the government is monitoring the banking system
and that he was confident the spread would fall in the next few
weeks.
    ""In the following weeks we'll discuss our budget with the
European Union and it will be possible to read out the details
of our fiscal plan,"" he said.

 (Adds detail, background)
    BERLIN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - German business morale
deteriorated slightly more than expected in October as trade
tensions, the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union
without a deal, and concerns about Italy's finances dampened
confidence.
    The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Thursday its
business climate index fell for the second month in a row to
102.8. That was lower than a Reuters consensus forecast of
103.0.
    ""Firms were less satisfied with their current business
situation and less optimistic about the months ahead,"" said Ifo
chief Clemens Fuest. ""Growing global uncertainty is increasingly
taking its toll on the German economy.""
    Consumption and state spending have been the main drivers
for growth in Germany as exports weaken. The dynamic domestic
economy is expected to continue propelling an upswing seen
entering its 10th year in 2019.  
    But the risk of a no-deal Brexit, trade tensions and a lack
of skilled workers are weighing on the growth outlook for
Europe's largest economy.
    ""The picture of the economy has become clearer,"" said Thomas
Gitzel of VP Bank Group. ""The German economy is sliding into a
weak phase. Trade disputes, tough Brexit negotiations and
concerns about Italy's state finances are unnerving companies.""
    The government said earlier this month it expected growth to
be slower in the third quarter, citing bottlenecks in the car
sector stemming from the introduction of new pollution standards
known as WLTP as a factor.
    The government has also lowered its economic growth forecast
for this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent previously. It
expects Europe's biggest economy to expand at the same pace in
both 2019 and 2020. The economy grew 2.2 percent last year.

    Wohlrabe said it would be difficult for Germany to meet a

sticking to a full year growth forecast of 1.7 percent. 
    He said exports expectations fell significantly in October

    ""The golden autumn for the German economy is not

spreading in the auto industry where business expectations fell
significantly, burdened by the WLTP emissions tests.

    By Rob Cox
    DOHA, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - An influential Saudi
Arabian prince once called Qatar, a spit of sand sticking into
the Persian Gulf like a thumb, nothing more than “300 people and
a television channel.” Such disdain inspired Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman to initiate a four-nation blockade of the
country. But not a year and a half later, the young Saudi
monarch has acknowledged what has become apparent to the world:
Qatar is doing just fine. 
    It would be easy for this tiny-but-rich nation of 2.6
million people to gloat over the global public display of
revulsion surrounding the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi
by Saudi agents. Yet “Saudenfreude,” or satisfaction over
condemnation of its neighbour’s alleged drawing-and-quartering
of a prominent dissident in its Istanbul consulate, is in short
supply in Doha.
    That’s not because Qatar is especially humble. Emir Sheikh
Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani’s visage is more ubiquitous in the
capital than those of his counterparts in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.
His silhouette adorns everything from skyscrapers to taxis. And
Qatar has never been shy about flaunting its good fortune,
embarking on flashy shopping sprees and acquiring trophy assets
like Harrods and French soccer club, Paris Saint-Germain.
    But taking an uncharacteristically quiet high road is now
Qatar’s best bet for handling the Saudi crisis. And with good
reason: a closed border with its neighbour to the south is
better than chaos on the other side, especially if it leads to
unrest over absolute monarchies in the region. Either through
internal checks or U.S. and European sanctions, the best outcome
for Qatar is a chastened crown prince - not a deposed one - who
is more acutely aware of the limits of his power. 
    It doesn’t take long in Doha to see the embargo by Saudi,
the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt has been something
of an economic blessing. After an initial shock, when some $30
billion of bank deposits from those countries were repatriated
and shipments of foodstuffs, like milk dried up, Qatar quickly
reoriented supply chains and funding sources in ways that may
ultimately benefit it for years to come. Even MbS gets that,
praising Qatar’s “great economy” in remarks at his Future
Investment Initiative on Wednesday.
    In what has become a symbol of Qatar’s resilience, the
country used its considerable wealth - which includes some $44
billion of reserves and a $300 billion sovereign fund - to ship
in 17,000 cows and an Irish farmer to become self-sufficient in
dairy. Iranian and Turkish produce is prominent on the shelves
of the downtown Doha Carrefour <CARR.PA>.
    Raw materials like bitumen, once purchased through resellers
in Dubai, now arrive directly, and at a lower cost, says one
government official. The embargo accelerated the expansion of
Hamad Port, a key infrastructural component of the Qatar
National Vision 2030, the country’s plan to prepare for when
energy demand slows. Since the embargo cut off key shipping
routes in the region, Hamad has forged new ones with Malaysia,
China, India and Greece.
    Though Qataris don’t want to say it on the record, there is
consistent pride in successfully weathering a Saudi-induced
“stress test”. There is also near-universal relief that it
occurred before the eyes of the world are focused on Qatar’s
hosting of soccer’s World Cup in 2022, a first for an Arab
nation. “The blockade has been a tragedy for many families who
have been separated - and for cooperation in the Gulf,” says one
senior official. “But we have to proceed as if the blockade is
permanent – that it’s the new normal”.
    The boycott began in June 2017, not long after U.S.
President Donald Trump visited the region and met MbS and his
father King Salman bin Abdulaziz, as well as Sheikh Tamim. It
came as a complete surprise in Doha. Not even the national
airline had any inkling it would be barred from flying to Dubai,
Riyadh, Cairo and other key destinations, or that its planes
would be forced to circumvent the airspace of the embargoing
nations.
    Yet even the airline is moving ahead. True, it lost $69
million in the year ended in March as 18 routes, and around 20
percent of its passengers, disappeared. Since then, it has added
24 new routes, and its chief says it may be facing a shortage of
aircraft as it gears up for the World Cup.
    For Qataris with relatives in the region – about 15,000
families and thousands more non-resident workers - the pain is
acute. Qatar didn’t reciprocate. In fact, the country relaxed
some visa restrictions after the blockade. But getting to Doha
requires a stop in Kuwait or Oman even for those allowed to
enter. The closure of the Saudi embassy also makes it virtually
impossible for Muslims in Qatar to arrange visits to the holy
sites of Mecca and Medina.
    Notwithstanding these difficulties, Qatar’s economy is
humming. Higher energy prices have been a boon for the gas
business that powers more than a third of GDP. Qatar has proven
reserves of around 173 billion barrels of oil equivalent, mostly
in the offshore North Field, which the U.S. Energy Information
Administration calls the largest single gas field in the world.
    The World Bank expects the economy to bounce back 2.8
percent this year, and grow another 3 percent in 2019, amid
higher energy prices and as spending on the World Cup continues.
After the games are done, the expansion of LNG output to 110
million tons a year, from around 77 million today, should ensure
massive government cash surpluses for years to come.
    The combination of the World Cup and the boycott appears to
have had another benefit that could elevate Qatar’s global
standing. Last month, the emir issued a new law partially
scrapping the exit permits that allowed employers to keep
migrant workers – of which Qatar has some 1.9 million – from
leaving the country. The move drew faint praise from workers’
rights groups. Amnesty International called it “an important
first step towards meeting the authorities' promise to
fundamentally reform the exploitative sponsorship system”.
    Add it all up, and Qatar appears to have made it through the
blockade with flying colours, supermarket shelves stocked with
goods, its people bursting with patriotism, while also making
progress on the way it treats guest workers. No wonder MbS
appears envious.

 (Adds economists' comments, background)
    By Joseph Nasr
    BERLIN, Oct 25 (Reuters) - German business morale
deteriorated slightly more than expected in October as rising
trade tensions and the possibility of Britain leaving the
European Union without a deal dampened confidence.
    The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Thursday its
business climate index fell for the second month in a row to
102.8, below a Reuters consensus forecast of 103.0.
    ""Firms were less satisfied with their current business
situation and less optimistic about the months ahead,"" said Ifo
chief Clemens Fuest. ""Growing global uncertainty is increasingly
taking its toll on the German economy.""
    Consumption and state spending have been the main growth
drivers in Germany as exports weaken. The dynamic domestic
economy is expected to continue propelling an upswing seen
entering its 10th year in 2019.  
    But the risk of a no-deal Brexit, trade tensions and a lack
of skilled workers are weighing on the growth outlook for
Europe's largest economy.
    Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said it would be difficult for
Germany to meet the 0.6 percent growth forecast for the fourth
quarter given by the institute in its autumn report. The
institute, however, is sticking to a full-year growth forecast
of 1.7 percent.
    ""The golden autumn for the German economy is not
materialising,"" Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that pessimism was
spreading in the auto industry where business expectations fell
significantly, burdened by stricter emissions tests.
    The government said earlier this month it expected growth to
be slower in the third quarter, citing bottlenecks in the car
sector stemming from the introduction of new pollution standards
known as WLTP as a factor.
    
    WEAK PHASE
    The government has also lowered its economic growth forecast
for this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent previously. It
expects the economy to expand at the same pace in both 2019 and
2020. The economy grew 2.2 percent last year.
    Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank said worries about Italy's spending
plans were also clouding the outlook.
    ""The German economy is sliding into a weak phase,"" he said.
""Trade disputes, tough Brexit negotiations and concerns about
Italy's state finances are unnerving companies.""
    Financial markets have reacted negatively to Italy's
expansionary budget, with bond yields rising to multi-year highs
as investors fret over Rome's defiance of EU fiscal rules and
the sustainability of its debt mountain -- the highest in the
euro zone after Greece.
    The European Commission has rejected Italy's 2019 budget
deficit target but Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said his
government would not change the plan.
    Still, economists think the German economy will keep growing
despite a weakening manufacturing sector and rising external
risks. Low interest rates, a weak euro and planned tax cuts to
help middle-income families should propel domestic demand.
    ""The uncertainty and the unpleasant gut feeling will
continue,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba wrote in a research note.
    ""At the same time, however, the present situation of the
German economy is still better than the recent stock market
correction might suggest.""

490,1705,2237,5512,00d774acb99914a3c9e048d7622ff6c3,Merkel protege issues stark warning to SPD before state election,2018-10-25 19:47:30,EUR,3.00751,2018-10-25 19:47:38,{'EUR': 'Negative'},"    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
preferred successor as head of Germany's conservatives warned
the Social Democrats (SPD) on Thursday that pulling out of the
ruling coalition after a weekend regional vote would trigger a
federal election.    
    With the conservatives and SPD facing a second local
election drubbing in two weeks, Sunday's vote in the western
state of Hesse could help decide how Merkel choreographs the end
of her 13-year stewardship of Europe's biggest economy.
    SPD members are piling pressure on their own leaders to
abandon the 'grand coalition' they reluctantly joined in March
and reinvent themselves.
    In unusually blunt language at a campaign event in the city
of Frankfurt, the general-secretary of Merkel's Christian
Democrats (CDU), spelt out what this could mean.
    ""If this government were to break apart now, it would lead
to new elections,"" said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who Merkel
promoted to the senior party post in February in a clear signal
that she is the chancellor's choice to succeed her.
    Opinion polls suggest a snap election would probably hurt
the conservatives and SPD most. 
    Merkel has been weakened by her 2015 decision to let more
than a million migrants into Germany and -- while polls show her
conservatives are still the biggest party -- their support has
fallen to 26-27 percent, meaning a coalition with the SPD might
no longer have sufficient support.
    The environmentalist Greens, on 16-20 percent have overtaken
the SPD in most surveys, and the far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) remain strong with 15-17 percent.
    After coming second in an election in the southern state of
Bavaria on Oct. 14, the Greens are also set to be kingmakers in
Hesse but big losses for the conservatives could spell the end
of the conservative-Greens alliance in the state. [nL8N1X33QJ]
    Infighting within Merkel's federal coalition, which also
includes Bavaria's CSU, has hit the popularity of all three
partners since they took office in March. The government came to
the brink of collapse in July due to a row over migrant policy.
    Kramp-Karrenbauer said the ruling parties must get together
after the Hesse election and decide on the government's policy
priorities.
    ""I believe that would be an important signal to people,"" she
said.
    Merkel is due to make her final campaign speech in Hesse
later on Thursday.

 (Updates with rate decision)
    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($684.30
billion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and rates
could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    ECB chief Mario Draghi is nevertheless expected to
acknowledge in his 1230 GMT news conference that the growth
outlook has worsened as both domestic and external factors weigh
on confidence, which would give the bank's policy outlook a
dovish undertone.
    Such a nuanced message is likely to keep expectations for
future rate hikes relatively benign with policymakers in the
past arguing for only small and infrequent moves from late next
year as growth slows to what is considered its natural potential
rate after an exceptional run last year.
    ""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to
remain at their present levels at least through the summer of
2019,"" the ECB said in a statement. 
    Investors will look to see if Draghi maintains the ECB's
long-standing assessment that risks to growth are broadly
balanced or whether he acknowledges the worsened outlook by
highlighting downside risks. 
    The problem is that investors might take a change of risk
assessment as a sign of an imminent policy move, and the ECB is
not prepared for that.
    So even if the growth outlook is worsening, Draghi could
still call risks balanced, partly to prevent a shift in
expectations. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high
and that it is too early to reassess interest rate guidance,
which calls for no change until ""through"" next summer. 
    Draghi is also expected to argue that inflation, the bank's
primary policy focus, is broadly following the path seen
earlier, with headline prices possibly stronger on higher oil
prices and core inflation on the weak side of expectations. 
       
    NO SUPPORT FOR ITALY
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi is also expected to be quizzed
about the cost of the escalating political fight between Rome
and Brussels.
    Draghi, himself an Italian, is expected to repeat that no
individual member state can expect the ECB's help, particularly
one whose troubles are caused by a breach of European Union
rules. 
    Its standoff with the EU has already cost Italy dearly
through higher borrowing costs as investors ditched its bonds
and depressed bank shares. 
    While the ECB is worried the Italian sell-off could spread
to other countries in the euro zone, it will be keen not to be
seen rewarding Rome's fiscal excesses by offering support.
    But Italy's turmoil comes at an unfortunate time for the
euro zone. Growth is already slowing, financial markets are
increasingly volatile, the risk of a no-deal Brexit looms large
and a global trade war may dent confidence further.     
    The German car industry's struggles to adjust to new
emissions standards could also dent third-quarter growth with
reverberating effects for the wider economy. 
    Beyond the broader economic outlook, Draghi may also discuss
tweaks to the ECB's policy on reinvesting cash from maturing
debt, particularly government debt bought as part of its Public
Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP).
    While that decision is also not expected until December, the
ECB could decide on Thursday to emphasize that it will remain in
the bond market for years to come, with enough firepower to
smooth periods of stress.
    Changes in reinvestments are expected to be mostly
technical, to ensure smooth implementation of ECB policies as
bonds often mature in large chunks.

    By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept
policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to
claw back unprecedented stimulus even as the growth outlook
continues to darken and political turmoil in Italy looms large
over the currency bloc.
    Having exhausted much of its firepower with years of
support, the ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase scheme will end this year and interest
rates could rise after next summer, sticking to a guidance first
unveiled in June and repeated at every meeting since.
    Acknowledging a weaker recent momentum in the euro zone
economy, ECB chief Mario Draghi reeled off what he called a
""bunch of uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism,
emerging markets and financial market volatility.
    ""Is this enough of a change to make us change the baseline
scenario? The answer is 'No',"" he told an ECB news conference to
justify its policymakers' decision to maintain their judgment
that risks remained ""broadly balanced"".
    He added: ""The underlying strength of the economy continues
to support our confidence that the sustained convergence of
inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even
after a gradual winding down of our net asset purchases.""
    Yet despite the hawkish message -- which included an upbeat
assessment of firmer wage pressures -- the euro fell on his
comment that Europe's monetary union remained ""fragile"" as long
as measures to shore up existing structures were not complete.
    ""And when I say completed, I mean the banking union, I mean
the capital market union,"" he added of measures initiated as a
result of the sovereign debt crisis of almost a decade ago but
which have foundered on a lack of consensus among member states.
    The single currency slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $1.139
after having earlier reached a session-high of $1.143.
    Earlier, the Governing Council statement reaffirmed its view
that interest rates would remain at present levels at least
""through the summer of 2019"". Draghi completed the picture by
adding there had been no discussion of extending stimulus. 
    Policymakers speaking in public and private have said the
bar for extending the ECB's bond purchase scheme is very high.
    With the EU having taken the unprecedented step of rejecting
Italy's budget this week, Draghi was quizzed at length about the
escalating political fight between Rome and Brussels over the
debt-laden country's expansionary budget.
    Himself an Italian, Draghi said he was confident compromise
would be reached between Brussels and Rome and noted how much
the stand-off was already costing Italy because of the rising
yield on its government debt. 
    Asked about the risk that a fall in the value of Italian
government bonds could erode the capital positions of some banks
that hold them, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball ... These
bonds are in the banks' portfolios. They are denting into the
capital position of the banks.
    ""I'm still confident an agreement will be found,"" Draghi
added.

President Mario Draghi said on Thursday the longer Brexit talks

    By Tommy Wilkes
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro reversed earlier gains
and fell on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario
Draghi said the monetary union remained fragile and failed to
assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy.  
    A rally in the U.S. dollar after a positive opening on Wall
Street also exacerbated euro weakness. The greenback rose to new
two-month highs against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. 
    Draghi had earlier lifted the single currency when he
expressed confidence about inflation reaching the bank's target.
The policy statement was light on new details and market moves
were small as Draghi stuck to the script for the bank's plan to
end quantitative easing gradually. [nDRAGHI][nL8N1X56JH]
    But concern about the risk of contagion from surging
borrowing costs in Italy - triggered by Rome's spending plans -
loomed large.
    ""There were no new details on monetary policy but the big
question asked was whether the ECB would use its tool kit to
respond to problems in Italy? He didn't answer that question.
Markets are slightly unnerved,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a
currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Rome's budget plans.
    Acknowledging the recent weaker momentum in the euro area
economy, he also reeled off what he called a ""bunch of
uncertainties"" related to trade protectionism, emerging markets
and financial market volatility. [nL8N1X55FN]
    Draghi also said the euro zone monetary union remained
""fragile"".  
    The euro fell to as low as $1.1370, down 0.2 percent on the
session, after trading as high as $1.1433. <EUR=EBS>.
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield gave up earlier
rises to trade flat on the day at 0.39 percent after the ECB
press conference <DE10YT=RR>. Some upward momentum also came
from U.S. Treasury yields which inched higher as the equity
selloff abated. 
    Italian government bond yields rose five basis points off
session lows but were still sharply down on the day. Its 10-year
yield was last at 3.53 percent, after earlier falling as low as
3.48 percent <IT5YT=RR>.
    Pan-European stock indexes fell into the red as Draghi spoke
before pulling higher when U.S. markets opened.

    By Tommy Wilkes and Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro reversed earlier gains
and fell on Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario
Draghi said Europe's monetary union remained fragile and failed
to assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy.  
    A rally in the U.S. dollar after a positive opening on Wall
Street exacerbated euro weakness. The dollar rose to new
two-month highs against a basket of currencies <.DXY>. 
    Draghi had earlier lifted the single currency when he
expressed confidence inflation would reach the bank's target.
The policy statement was light on new details and market moves
were small as Draghi stuck to the script for the bank's plan to
end quantitative easing gradually. [nDRAGHI][nL8N1X56JH]
    But concern about the risk of contagion from surging
borrowing costs in Italy - triggered by Rome's spending plans -
loomed large.
    ""There were no new details on monetary policy, but the big
question asked was whether the ECB would use its tool kit to
respond to problems in Italy. He didn't answer that question.
Markets are slightly unnerved,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a
currency strategist at Commerzbank.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Rome's budget plans.
    Acknowledging the weaker momentum in the euro area economy,
he also reeled off what he called a ""bunch of uncertainties""
related to trade protectionism, emerging markets and financial
market volatility. [nL8N1X55FN] And he said the monetary union
remained ""fragile"".  
    The euro fell to as low as $1.1370, down 0.2 percent on the
session, after trading as high as $1.1433. <EUR=EBS>.
    Germany's 10-year government bond yield gave up earlier
rises to trade flat on the day at 0.39 percent after the ECB
press conference <DE10YT=RR>. Some upward momentum also came
from U.S. Treasury yields, which inched higher as this week's
equity tumble abated. 
    Italian government bond yields rose five basis points off
session lows during Draghi's comments but remained down on the
day. Its 10-year yield was last at 3.53 percent, after earlier
falling as low as 3.48 percent <IT5YT=RR>.
    ""He did a pretty good job of communicating the ECB is still
on track to remove stimulus but is at the same time monitoring
the risks without panicking or downplaying the situation,"" said
DZ Bank analyst Pascal Segesser. 
    ""He also said if markets and price stability is hurt there
would be measures they could take, tools they could use."" 
    Pan-European stock indexes fell into the red as Draghi spoke
before pulling higher when U.S. markets opened.

    FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's
preferred successor as head of Germany's conservatives warned
the Social Democrats (SPD) on Thursday that quitting the ruling
coalition after a weekend regional vote would trigger a federal
election.    
    With the conservatives and SPD facing a second local
election drubbing in two weeks, Sunday's vote in the western
state of Hesse could help decide how Merkel choreographs the end
of her 13-year stewardship of Europe's biggest economy.
    SPD members are piling pressure on their own leaders to
abandon the 'grand coalition' they reluctantly joined in March
and reinvent themselves.
    In unusually blunt language at a campaign event in the city
of Frankfurt, the general-secretary of Merkel's Christian
Democrats (CDU), spelt out what this could mean.
    ""If this government were to break apart now, it would lead
to new elections,"" said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who Merkel
promoted to the senior party post in February in a clear signal
that she is the chancellor's choice to succeed her.
    Opinion polls suggest a snap election would probably hurt
the conservatives and SPD most. 
    Merkel has been weakened by her 2015 decision to let more
than a million migrants into Germany and -- while polls show her
conservatives are still the biggest party -- their support has
fallen to 26-27 percent, meaning a coalition with the SPD might
no longer have sufficient support.
    The environmentalist Greens, on 16-20 percent have overtaken
the SPD in most surveys, and the far-right Alternative for
Germany (AfD) remain strong with 15-17 percent.
    After coming second in an election in the southern state of
Bavaria on Oct. 14, the Greens are also set to be kingmakers in
Hesse, but big losses for the conservatives could spell the end
of the conservative-Greens alliance in the state. [nL8N1X33QJ]
    Merkel, in a final campaign speech in Hesse, urged
supporters to go to the polls on Sunday and be ""ambassadors"" for
continued conservative leadership in the state.
    ""Everyone who has the right to vote should do their part,""
she said in the city of Fulda, which borders the former East
Germany. ""You can only vote once every five years. That is when
the future of Hesse will be determined.""
    State premier Volker Bouffier told the rally it was critical
to avoid a leftist alliance taking power.
    ""Either we keep this successful model that we have in Hesse
or there is a leftist alliance,"" he said. ""Those are the
alternatives. Nothing else matters.""
    Infighting within Merkel's federal coalition, which also
includes Bavaria's CSU, has hit the popularity of all three
partners since they took office in March. The government came to
the brink of collapse in July due to a row over migrant policy.

    BUCHAREST, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Romania's Constitutional Court
struck down on Thursday dozens of changes to the criminal code
made by the ruling Social Democrats that had been criticised by
the European Union, diplomats and magistrates.
    The changes are part of a series of legal and personnel
changes made by the Social Democrats in the two years since they
took power that are seen as threats to judicial independence and
could further heighten European Union concerns about democratic
values in some of its eastern member states. [nL8N1WZ6DD]
    The top court rejected a slew of the changes made to the
criminal code, but details of its decision will be released at a
later date.
    Earlier this month, the court also rejected about 70 percent
of changes made to criminal procedures that were challenged and
that would have raised the burden of proof. 
    Both bills will now return to parliament for discussion.
    Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the EU's
most corrupt states and Brussels has been keeping its justice
system under special monitoring since its 2007 entry.     
    The EU, who is already seeking sanctions against Poland and
Hungary for weakening the rule of law are concerned Romania is
following suit.
    Prosecutors have secured a spate of convictions in recent
years against lawmakers, ministers and mayors, including Social
Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea. Their investigations have exposed
conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and awarding of
state contracts in exchange for bribes.
    On Wednesday, Romania's justice minister demanded the
dismissal of the prosecutor general, the last major figure in
the anti-corruption drive that has won praise from Brussels for
exposing high-level corruption, including the theft of EU
funds.[nL8N1X479Q]. 
    The Social Democrats have said their legal initiatives were
aimed at aligning legislation with EU norms and address abuses
allegedly committed by magistrates.
    Earlier this month, the Venice Commission, the Council of
Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters said the
changes to the criminal code and procedures were made with
""excessive speed and insufficient transparency"". 
    It added they would weaken magistrates' ability ""to fight
corruption offences, violent crimes and organised criminality"".

    NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks followed Europe
higher on Thursday after investors ventured into risky bets
again with encouragement from some strong earnings and the
dollar rose against the euro after remarks from Europe's Central
Bank chief fueled fears about the monetary union.
    Oil prices stabilized after an early sell-off as investors
returned their focus to the fundamentals of supply and demand as
equity markets regained some lost ground. [nL3N1X52LS]
    The greenback rose against the euro after the ECB's Mario
Draghi reaffirmed that its 2.6-trillion euro ($2.97 trillion)
asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates
could rise after next summer even though the economic outlook
has darkened and political turmoil looms in Italy. [nL8N1X56JH]
    While equity investors sought bargains and some were
reassured by positive earnings and stronger technology stocks,
they also voiced caution. 
    ""There's a sense of nervousness and caution because a lot of
people were caught off guard by the drop yesterday,"" Scott
Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg,
Florida said. 
    ""At this point it's all about sentiment. People are looking
for things to settle down and I think we need to see more
concrete evidence of that.""
    Wall Street was helped by reassuring results from Microsoft
Corp <MSFT.O> and strong advertising revenues from Twitter Inc
<TWTR.N>. Google-parent Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Amazon.com
<AMZN.O> were among the top boosters of the S&P ahead of their
results later. [nL3N1X55IG] 
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 375.12 points,
or 1.53 percent, to 24,958.54, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 47.06
points, or 1.77 percent, to 2,703.16 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 196.21 points, or 2.76 percent, to 7,304.61.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> was darting in and out
of positive territory. It rose 0.51 percent and MSCI's gauge of
stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.70 percent.
    Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and
Rome would come to a compromise over Rome's budget plans, but
the euro reversed earlier gains after he said the monetary union
remained fragile. [nL8N1X57HB]
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.18 percent, with the euro
<EUR=> down 0.15 percent to $1.1374.
    Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc <CHF=> and
Japanese yen <JPY=> safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds
held their ground as Draghi reiterated the European Central
Bank's plans to carefully remove its stimulus. [nL8N1X53ZM]
    The Japanese yen weakened 0.28 percent versus the greenback
at 112.61 per dollar, while Sterling <GBP=> was last trading at
$1.2823, down 0.44 percent on the day.
    MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 1.22 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> lost 3.72 percent. [nL3N1X52Q4]
    But in China, the Shanghai SE Composite index <.SSEC>
managed to eke out a tiny gain after dropping as much as 2.8
percent at one point. [nL3N1X51LA] [nH9N1WZ024] 
    Investors were also eyeing mixed U.S. economic data. 
    New applications for U.S. unemployment aid rose last week,
but the number of Americans receiving benefits fell to more than
a 45-year low, pointing to tightening labor market conditions.
[nUSNPLEEMN]
     But new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell for a
second straight month in September and the goods trade deficit
increased further amid rising imports, suggesting economic
growth moderated in the third quarter. [nL2N1X41XN] 
    Benchmark 10-year Treasuries <US10YT=RR> last fell 4/32 in
price to yield 3.1375 percent, from 3.124 percent late on
Wednesday.  [nL2N1X50UP]
    U.S. crude <CLcv1> rose 1.03 percent to $67.51 per barrel

day. [nL3N1X52LS]

 (Recasts with euro at 2-month low, updates prices)
    By Kate Duguid
    NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a two-month
low on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi said the bank would pursue its tightening policy in spite
of fears about the monetary union's economic and political
future.
    The ECB reaffirmed that its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.97
trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and that 
interest rates could rise after next summer. The policy guidance
has been consistent since June, even though the economic outlook
has darkened while political turmoil in Italy looms over the
currency bloc. [nL8N1X56JH]
    Although Draghi said he was confident the European
Commission and Rome would reach a compromise over Italy's budget
plans, he failed to allay concerns about the risk of contagion
from surging borrowing costs.
    The single currency <EUR=> rose immediately after the
central bank's rates announcement, then began to sell off ""once
Draghi started speaking again and highlighted the risks around
Italy and Brexit,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing
and trading at Tempus, Inc. 
    Doyle said the euro's decline was the primary reason for
Thursday's jump in the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the
greenback's performance against a basket of six major
currencies. It was amplified, however, by the rise in U.S.
stocks at the opening bell after a sell-off on Wednesday, which
pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased all the
year's gains on the S&P 500 <.SPX> and the Dow <DJI.>.
[nL3N1X55HN]
    Against the dollar, the euro fell to $1.1361, its lowest
since Aug. 16. The single currency was last down 13 basis points
on the day. The dollar index hit a two-month high of 96.681,
last up 27 basis points from the open.
    Sterling hit a six-week bottom of $1.281 <GBP=> after Draghi
said the longer Brexit talks drag on, the more the private
sector must prepare for the possibility that Britain could exit
the European Union with no deal on future relations.
[nL8N1X57M7]
    Elsewhere, the Japanese yen <JPY=> weakened, although the
Swiss franc <CHF=>, a rival safe-haven currency, gained. 
    The yen weakened to as much as 112.63 against the dollar,
but nevertheless remained up 1.7 percent from its 2018 trough
hit on Oct. 3.
    The Swiss franc spiked against the dollar following the
Draghi announcement to trade as high as $1.002 <CHF=> and
strengthened by 16 basis points against the euro <EURCHF=>.
    The Australian dollar, often viewed as a bellwether for
global risk, rose 0.26 percent to $0.708 <AUD=>. However, in a
sign that worries about global growth, particularly in China,
are beginning to bite, the offshore yuan <CNH=> hit a 22-month
low, last at 6.954.

Politics
Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A regional election in the large
German state of Hesse this weekend is the latest hazard for
Angela Merkel's bickering coalition government, with both her
conservatives and her centre-left SPD partners expected to shed
votes. For the SPD in particular, its declining poll fortunes
are becoming an existential crisis - so much so that it has
started asking whether it should step back into opposition.
Merkel's party is warning the SPD that it would likely call a
snap election in that case - something which opinion polls
suggest would be devastating for the two mainstream parties. In
Hesse, much of the focus will be on the performance of the
far-right AfD, but particularly the resurgent Greens, whose
charismatic half-Yemeni leader could turn out to be the
kingmaker in forming the next regional government there.
    Austria is using its role as the current holder of the EU
presidency to call for an arms ban on Saudi Arabia in the wake
of Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Germany, which has already said it
is halting its relatively modest arms supplies to the Saudis, is
in favour: the question is how more major suppliers such as the
UK and France respond. The UK's scheduled departure from the EU
means it would not in any case have to join any EU move on the
matter; France could block it if it chose. President Emmanuel
Macron told Saudi King Salman on Wednesday that France could
take action against those held responsible for the murder.
However, since coming to power last year Macron has largely
ignored protests over arms sales he deems vital to jobs and
France's strategic relationships in the region. 
    
MARKETS AT 6.55 GMT
    So last night’s Wall Street rise was probably a dead-cat
bounce after all. Asian markets are a sea of red this morning,
Europe is opening weaker and U.S. futures are sharply lower. We
had less than scintillating earnings from Amazon and Google,
which led to an after-hours slides by their shares, and markets
are also worrying about China where despite stock markets are
down sharply and the yuan is sliding towards the key 7 per
dollar mark  -- it reached 6.98, the weakest since January 2017
and brought out the PBOC this morning to threaten ""targeted
steps"" against those shorting CNY and promise macro-prudential
measures. 
    But there is also the issue of central bank policy
tightening – the ECB’s Mario Draghi signalled yesterday it is
unlikely the bank will hold off removing stimulus by year-end
despite signs of slowing growth and the troubles in Italy. 
    With the economic growth picture darkening, attention will
focus today on U.S. third-quarter GDP. Some investors reckon the
tailwinds from tax cuts and repatriation are already weakening,
as highlighted by the recent lacklustre durable-goods orders.  
    World stocks are set for a fifth straight week of losses, 
the longest losing streak since 2013, and look on track for
their worst month in seven years. The S&P500 is just 1 percent
off losing all its gains for the year. Emerging-market equities
are down 20 percent and heading for their worst year since 2011
and worst month since May 2012. With more earnings due,
including from emerging-market-focused consumer goods bellwether
Colgate Palmolive and industrials such as Goodyear Tyres and
Rockwell Collins, investors are hypersensitive to the
beats/misses but also to forward guidance from companies. All
those fears are pushing investors back into bonds, with U.S.
10-year yields down towards one-month lows, while  German yields
are at the lowest since Sept. 10, having slipped 11 basis points
this week.  
    Italian yields are up before Italy’s rating review by S&P.
Views are mixed on what will happen, but hopes are the agency
will content itself with merely downgrading the outlook on the
rating to negative, leaving it two notches above investment
grade. It may cut the rating and keep the outlook stable – also
not too bad. On the Brexit front, a source-based Bloomberg
report that said talks had stalled sent sterling briefly lower
overnight but it’s flat now and awaiting more headlines. Other
currencies are reflecting the risk off – yen and Swiss franc
have risen, the Australian dollar and emerging currencies are
lower. The dollar hit 2 1/2-month highs yesterday but is now
flat. Oil prices are set for  a third weekly loss, shedding 4
percent so far this week.
    On European stocks, it looks set to be a day of heavy losses
– down 1 percent or more across various bourses- after U.S.
futures tumbled following results from Amazon and Alphabet and
prompting renewed concern about the dominance of tech in this
market cycle. Car parts maker Valeo could fall the most, though
- it's indicated down as much as 10 percent after its results
missed estimates by 22 percent and it slashed guidance for next
year by 11 percent. The warnings echoed Daimler’s and others in
the auto sector flagging disruption from tougher European
emissions tests and slower sales in China, and the sector could
be bruised as a result. 
    Stronger results from British Airways owner IAG could help
the travel and leisure sector, which has been under pressure
with airlines warning of fuel costs rising. With some analysts
citing a report Brexit talks are in deadlock, Britain’s FTSE 100
will be a focus and has opened 1 percent lower. RBS shares are
down 4 percent after it said it had taken a 100 million-pound
impairment provision to account for greater economic
uncertainty, the first concrete sign Brexit is clouding the
outlook for banks. Healthcare could also be under pressure after
U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to base Medicare
drug prices on lower overseas rates. Of the Europe-listed pharma
names, Roche, Ipsen, Grifols and UCB have the biggest exposure
to the U.S. Medicare Part B, according to Goldman Sachs. Spanish
bank Sabadell has jumped 5.5 percent after better-than-expected
results
    In company news and stock movers: Britain's RBS puts cash
aside, warns of economic uncertainty; BA owner IAG's Q3 profit
slightly beats market estimates; Volvo Cars Q3 income falls due
to launch costs, higher tariffs; Spain's Caixabank Q3 net profit
down 27.6 percent due to Repsol sale; aAsset manager Amundi
reports higher Q3 profits; Signify beats expectations with 8
percent rise in Q3 core profit; UBS CEO Ermotti won't rule out
M&A, says options are limited; Volkswagen readies truck business
Traton for stock market listing; Brewer Ambev squeezed by Brazil
competition, Argentina inflation; AIG receives UK approval for
Brexit restructure; Freenet open to offers for its $1 billion
stake in Sunrise; NordLB stake sale sparks merger talks among
German public sector banks; Lufthansa eyes divestments of
non-core businesses.
    In emerging markets, two key events are due at the weekend -
the second and final round of elections in Brazil, where right-
wing Jair Bolsanaro, the market’s preferred candidate, looks
almost certain to win. Brazilian assets have been scorching hot,
so the question is whether this is a classic case of buy the
rumour, sell the election win fact – Brazil's real is up for
sixth straight week. The second is the conclusion of a public
vote in Mexico on whether to give up on its half-built, white
elephant of a new airport. It is seen as a test of incoming
President AMLO's business credentials. The Mexican peso is  down
for fourth straight week and the Turkish lira is flirting with a
third straight week of gain 
    Russia's central bank meets today and should keep rates
unchanged at 7.50 but the rouble's recent decline and rise in
inflation expectations could see a 25 bps hike from the hawkish
bank.

    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - More questions are being asked
about the viability of Angela Merkel's ruling coalition in
Berlin after both parties suffered heavy losses in this
weekend's regional election in the large central state of Hesse,
home to the financial capital, Frankfurt. Merkel's left-leaning
partners, the SPD, in particular have lost all sense of
direction, with some commentators talking about an existential
threat to one of Europe's oldest political parties. Its
embattled leader, Andrea Nahles, has given Merkel an ultimatum
to produce the kind of policy results within a year that would
start bringing back voters, threatening otherwise to end the
alliance. Merkel will respond this afternoon.
    British finance minister Philip Hammond will warn hard
Brexiters in his party today that any end to unpopular austerity
measures will depend on averting a no-deal Brexit, implicitly
urging them to get behind PM Theresa May's compromise plan.
While some forecasters say such a no-deal scenario would bring
growth to a near standstill next year and push up state
borrowing, Hammond's standing with hard Brexiters in
Conservative ranks is so low that it is far from certain they
will be impressed by his warnings. He told weekend talk shows
the biggest item in this afternoon's budget would be the
increase in spending due to go to the health service, with other
measures due to include more spending on roads, a tax cut for
small retailers hammered by online competition and more spending
on broadband. 
    Standard & Poor's on Friday left Italy's sovereign debt
rating unchanged but lowered its outlook to negative from
stable, saying that the new government's policy plans were
weighing on the country's growth and debt prospects. Sheer
relief that there was no ratings downgrade has pushed Italy's
bond yields sharply lower this morning.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
Fresh worries about trade-related hits to Chinese corporate
profit growth and incoming earnings unnerved Shanghai stocks on
Monday, sending another negative pulse across Asia bourses after
a torrid week on world stock markets that saw MSCI’s all-country
global index lose almost 4 percent to its lowest in more than
year - making October so far as the worst month for global
stocks since 2011.  After weekend data showing Chinese profit
growth slowed for the fifth straight month in September, the
Shanghai-Shenzhen composite CSI300 dropped more than 3 percent
in its worst day in more than two weeks. China’s offshore yuan
weakened too, though it remained above Friday’s trough – the
weakest since January last year. Seoul’s Kospi lost more than 1
percent, Jakarta was down about half a percent and Japan’s
Nikkei was modestly in the red. Australia’s benchmark
outperformed with gains of more than 1 percent, however. 
    Although S&P500 futures were down overnight, showing little
sign of a bounce after Friday’s lunge to its lowest since May,
there were more positive signs for European stocks. The
EuroStoxx 50 opened up 0.45 percent, with a mix of positives,
from S&P Global credit rating firm declining to downgrade
Italy’s sovereign rating on Friday to indications from Germany’s
Social Democrats that they would stay in coalition with
Chancellor Merkel’s conservative for, even though both parties
saw big losses of support in weekend state elections in Hesse.
Higher-than-forecast third-quarter revenue growth from HSBC also
helped the early mood in Europe in another heavy week for
corporate earnings, and HSBC stock opened up 5 percent before
the bell. Italian bond yields fell on Monday, with 10-year
borrowing costs hitting a one-week low after S&P’s decision to
leave Italy’s rating two notches above junk territory, although
it lowered its outlook to negative to stable. Moody’s had cut
its rating the previous week. The Italian yield spread over
Germany fell to 300 basis points from 306 bps late Friday.
    Outside the region, Brazilian stocks and the real are
expected to rise after right-wing candidate Bolsorano won
Brazil’s presidential elections on Sunday. Tokyo-listed
Brazilian stock ETFs were up more than 10 percent overnight.
Elsewhere, currency markets were calmer than the equity markets,
with dollar index up marginally and both dollar/yen and
euro/dollar flat versus Friday’s closes. Sterling was also
little changed ahead of UK finance minister Philip Hammond’s
autumn budget statement later in the day. Ten-year U.S. Treasury
yields were a touch lower at 3.06 percent.  Brent crude oil
prices were down at just above $77.

 (Adds detail, analyst quotes)
    By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
    BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
told leaders of her conservatives on Monday that she will not
seek re-election as party chairwoman, senior party sources said,
heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated
European politics.
    Merkel, 64, has been chairwoman of her conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005.
Party sources said Merkel wants to remain chancellor until 2021,
when the next federal election is due.
    The announcement caused the euro <EUR=> to fall briefly and
German government bond yields rose. [nL8N1X924N]
    Stepping down as CDU chairwoman would further undermine
Merkel's authority, which has already been dented this year by
two regional election setbacks and a close ally losing his role
as leader of her conservatives' parliamentary group.
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.
    ""We are witnessing a continuation of the pattern in place
ever since Merkel’s mistakes in the 2015 migration crisis: the
gradual but steady erosion of her political power,"" said Carsten
Nickel, managing director at Teneo, a consultancy.
    ""Rather than outright instability in Germany and Europe, it
simply means a continuation of the current leadership vacuum.""
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist
parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.
    Her decision comes on the heels of a second electoral
setback in as many weeks for Merkel's conservative alliance. In
a vote in the western state of Hesse on Sunday, the CDU came out
top but lost 11 percentage points in support compared to the
last election in 2013. [nL8N1X804M]
    ""With these latest results, it has simply become untenable
that Merkel continues to lead the CDU,"" said Mujtaba Rahman,
managing director at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.
    ""But the news might not all be bad, as this could increase
the chances Merkel seeks a top EU job next year,"" he added.
    When Merkel came into office in 2005, George W. Bush was
U.S. president, Jacques Chirac was in the Elysee Palace in Paris
and Tony Blair was British prime minister.
    The news that she would not seek the party chair again came
as a shock to many CDU officials who believed the party's result
in Hesse could have been worse.
    Merkel standing down from the party chair would allow a new
CDU chairman or chairwoman to build a profile before the next
national election. Merkel's favoured successor is CDU party
secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
    Several conservative party sources said that Friedrich Merz,
a former parliamentary leader of Merkel's conservative alliance,
was ready to put himself forward for the CDU chairmanship at the
party's congress in December.

    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German bond yields rose on Monday
on growing political uncertainty in the euro zone's powerhouse
economy, while Italy's borrowing costs fell sharply on relief
that Standard & Poor's left its credit rating unchanged.
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told senior members of
her Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election
as party leader at a conference in December, a senior party
source said on Monday. [nS8N1WD01U]
    According to CDU sources, Merkel said she would not stand as
candidate for chancellor or lawmaker after 2021. [nS8N1WD025]
    Merkel has led the CDU since 2000 and giving up the role
would start a race within the party to succeed her as German
leader.
    The news followed poor results for the CDU and its junior
coalition partner at a weekend election in the western state of
Hesse. [nL8N1X804M]
    While German bonds, regarded as one of the safest assets in
the word, often benefit from uncertainty, the implications of
latest political developments left even German bond investors
slightly rattled and the euro <EUR=> came under selling
pressure, albeit briefly. [nL8N1X92EG]
    ""This news would signal the quality of German credit would
deteriorate because markets are extrapolating from the results
of the weekend state election to conclude that the next
government will have a bigger populist portion to it,"" said
Mizuho rates strategist Peter Chatwell.
    ""So that explains the rise in German yields but there is
also a need to treat German bonds as a risk-free (investment),
so if there was a lot of stress a selloff would be limited.""
    Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was up 4 basis points
at 0.39 percent <DE10YT=RR>, well above seven-week lows hit last
week at around 0.34 percent.
    It was set for its biggest one-day jump in almost four weeks
and was the clear underperformer in euro zone bond markets.
Across the German curve, yields were up 2-4 bps on the day.
    
    The selloff in German bonds and a firmer tone to European
stock markets after a bruising few sessions last week was
accompanied by rising yields for higher-rated euro zone bonds.
<FR10YT=RR> <NL10YT=RR>
    However, borrowing costs in Italy fell sharply - benefiting
bond markets in Spain and Portugal, where yields also fell
<ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR>.
    That followed a decision on Friday by Standard & Poor's to
leave Italy's rating unchanged at BBB, two notches above junk. 
    The ratings agency lowered the outlook for Italian ratings
to negative from stable, saying that the new government's policy
plans were weighing on the country's growth and debt prospects.
[nL8N1X67LT]
    But the decision to leave the rating unchanged, a week after
Moody's downgraded its rating, bought some relief to a bond
market hurt by the spending plans of the new government in Rome,
tension between it and the European Union.
    Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to a one-week low at 3.31
percent <IT10YT=RR>, while the gap over top-rated German bond
yields narrowed to 293 bps from around 306 bps late Friday
<DE10IT10=RR>.
    ""The ratings update was a relief,"" Commerzbank rates
strategist Rainer Guntermann said. ""The underlying budget
concern is an ongoing issue but the ratings risks are out of the
way for the rest of the year as there are no more scheduled
ratings decisions.""

 (Recasts with Merkel report, adds quote, updates prices)
    By Tom Finn
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The euro briefly weakened on
Monday after a report that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will
not seek re-election as party chairwoman, marking the end of a
13-year era in which she has dominated European politics.
    The euro fell 0.4 percent to hit a day's low of $1.136
<EUR=EBS> after senior party sources made the announcement,
effectively clearing the way for her Christian Democrats party
to groom her successor. [nL8N1X926U]
    The currency later recovered to trade flat on the day at
$1.14.  
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.
    ""The euro has come under some pressure because she is seen
as a pro-European force despite being a tough negotiator when it
comes to bail-outs,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a currency
strategist at Commerzbank. 
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit and a budget crisis in Italy.
    The dollar rose towards a 10-week high against a basket of
other currencies as concerns about global growth pervaded
markets. 
    World stocks have sold off in October, beset by worries over
corporate earnings and geopolitical uncertainty.
    That has lifted the greenback, a currency which typically
outperforms in risk-off periods but has strengthened only
moderately.
    ""This likely reflects a number of factors, including long
dollar positioning and, by the end of this week, some modest
repricing of Federal Reserve expectations,"" said Zach Pandl,
co-head of foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs.
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.2 percent to 96.670 after
gaining 0.7 percent last week when it hit a ten-month high. 
    The duelling tariffs imposed by the United States and China
have also lifted the dollar. The market has assumed that while
the U.S. economy will be hit by reduced trade, it will be hurt
less than its trading partners.
    ""Keeping the dollar bid this week should be a continuation
of strong U.S. data. At the same time, we will be watching
developments in China,"" ING's head of FX strategy Chris Turner
said.   
    After weekend data showing Chinese profit growth slowed for
the fifth straight month in September, China's offshore yuan
weakened, though it remained above Friday's trough of 6.977
<CNH=EBS>, the weakest since January last year, as it creeps
ever closer to 7.00. 
    ""Were the 7 level to be breached, we would expect USD/Asia,
and probably USD/EM in general, to take another leg higher and
the dollar to be bid across the board,"" Turner said.
    The U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third
quarter, data showed on Friday, as the strongest consumer
spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory
investment offset a tariff-related drop in soybean exports.
    
    BOLSONARO WINS
    Among emerging markets, Brazilian-linked stocks got a lift
from the victory in the country's presidential election of
far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on promises
to clean up politics and crack down on crime.
    As of 1130 GMT, the real <BRL=> had not yet traded. It had
ended Friday's session at 3.6426 per dollar.
    The safe-haven Japanese yen <JPY=D3> has benefited from the
global sell-off in riskier assets as investors unwound carry
trade exposures. It gained 0.6 percent last week and on Monday
traded flat at 111.96 per dollar.
    Investors will be watching the Bank of Japan's monetary
policy announcement, due on Wednesday.
    Sterling <GBP=D3> held near a two-month trough of $1.2775
before Britain's annual budget due on Monday. 
    Finance Minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his
Conservative Party to back the government's plan for Brexit, or
put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity. [nL8N1X80ZP]

Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Waterfall Asset
Management have joined B2Holding in investing in a bad loan
portfolio originated by Greece's Alpha Bank <ACBr.AT>, EBRD said
on Monday.
    Alpha Bank sold a portfolio of non-performing loans (NPLs)
to B2Holding in March, as part of efforts to reduce its bad loan
pile and meet targets agreed with the Bank of Greece and the
European Central Bank's Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
    B2Holding is a pan-European debt specialist headquartered in
Oslo while Waterfall Asset Management focuses on structured
credit and private equity investments.
    Greek banks are saddled with billions of euros of sour
loans, struggling with the highest ratio of so-called
non-performing exposures (NPEs) in Europe following the
country's seven-year debt crisis.
    Top lenders including Alpha had an NPE ratio of 47.6 percent
at the end of June versus an average 4.5 percent in Europe.
[nL5N1VS240]
    Reducing the pile is a crucial step towards cleaning up
balance sheets, helping banks to cut loan-loss provisions and
free up capital for new lending to support Greece's economic
recovery.   
    The EBRD started investing in Greece on a temporary basis in
2015 to support its recovery. To date it has invested more than
2 billion euros ($2.28 billion) in more than 40 projects.
    The NPL transaction is the first sub-project under the
EBRD's 300 million euro NPL Resolution Framework that was
launched last year, involving the purchase of an NPL portfolio
in Greece.
    The EBRD said its portion in the Alpha Bank NPL sale will be
25 million euros.

    * Says Greece's finances are under control for 2-1/2 years
    * Says EU should be understanding with Italy on budget talks

    By Abhinav Ramnarayan
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Volatility in Italian government
debt has made it harder for Greece to return to bond markets,
Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told Reuters, but said
he is comfortable with waiting for the right time to raise
funds. 
    A recent selloff in Italian government debt has pushed up
the borrowing costs of other Southern European countries,
including Greece. 
    But Tsakalotos told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference
on Friday that his country's financing needs are under control.
    Greece, which exited that last of its bailout programmes in
August, has agreed debt relief measures with its euro zone
partners. These extend maturities on some loans and soften the
interest rate burden on others. Athens also has a 24 billion
euro cash buffer, which will help to improve debt sustainability
over the medium term. [nL5N1V71XX]
    Tsakalotos said Athens would return to the bond market at
the optimal time, and played down the Italian bond selloff.
    ""It has made it a little harder but on the other hand I
think markets are now becoming more sophisticated in
understanding that Greece has finished its programme, it has
done a huge amount of reforms, it's got a buffer so that its
financing needs are under control for at least 2-1/2 years,"" he
said. 
    ""Also it has got a debt deal that means financing its debt
is easier than it is in Portugal and Italy.""
    Asked if Greece will attempt a bond sale this year through
syndication -- where banks are appointed to sell debt directly
to investors -- Tsakalotos said he will leave the timing up to
Greece's debt agency chief. 
    ""He has instructions from the government that when markets
are appropriate, we would like to go. But it's his job to do the
research and to tell us when it is the optimal time,"" he said. 
    ""We're comfortable that we can wait since we have the
buffer, but that doesn't mean we won't go when the time is
right, and I think the time will be right over the medium term.""
    Earlier in the year, Athens was believed to be considering a
10-year bond syndication, its first sale in that benchmark
maturity since its debt crisis began in 2010. 
    Since then, Italian debt has sold off as the new
anti-establishment government in Rome set out spending plans
that put it at odds with Brussels. 
    Italy's 10-year bond yields <IT10YT=RR> have nearly doubled
from 1.72 percent in April to 3.31 percent on Monday, dragging
up Greek 10-year yields <GR10YT=RR> from 3.85 percent at the
start of May to 4.25 percent currently. 
    
    ITALIAN TALKS
    Even so, Tsakalotos said the European Commission should be
understanding when negotiating with Rome over its budget plans. 
    ""Italy is a country whose GDP per capita has hardly
increased in the last 20 years and it's also a country with huge
regional inequalities,"" he said. ""So it's important that the
Commission and member states take into account the Italian
situation and try to reach a compromise which would be good for
the people of Italy but also for Europe itself."" 
    Asked if Italy should look at an alternative route, he said
it was important that Italy stays in the European Union. 
    ""I'm a pro-European for a lot of reasons but a major reason
is that I've always feared that if Europe breaks up, it will
result into the kind of nasty right-wing populist politics of
the 1930s with competitive devaluations, rival nationalisms,"" he
said. 
    ""So I think it's important for European people and for a
progressive agenda that we not only avoid that but reform Europe
in a way that addresses the real issues people face in terms of
social inequalities, the amount of jobs available and the
quality of those jobs.""

 (Updates move in Italy bonds, details on Merkel, adds comment)
    By Dhara Ranasinghe
    LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - German bond yields rose on Monday
after Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would not seek
re-election as party chairwoman and that her fourth term as
chancellor would be her last, while Italian yields fell on
relief at an unchanged ratings verdict from S&P.
    Merkel has been chairwoman of her conservative Christian
Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005. Her
decision to step down as chairwoman comes after her party
suffered its second regional election setback in as many weeks.
    The move also sets in motion the process for the CDU to
settle on, and groom, Merkel's successor. [nL8N1X926U]
    While German bonds, regarded as one of the safest assets in
the world, often benefit from uncertainty, the implications of
latest political developments left even German bond investors
slightly rattled while the euro <EUR=> weakened. [nL8N1X92EG]
    ""This news would signal the quality of German credit would
deteriorate because markets are extrapolating from the results
of the weekend state election to conclude that the next
government will have a bigger populist portion to it,"" said
Mizuho rates strategist Peter Chatwell.
    ""So that explains the rise in German yields but there is
also a need to treat German bonds as a risk-free (investment),
so if there was a lot of stress a selloff would be limited.""
    Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose 4 basis points
to 0.39 percent <DE10YT=RR>, above seven-week lows hit last week
at around 0.34 percent.
    It was set for its biggest one-day jump in almost four weeks
and was the clear underperformer in euro zone bond markets.
Across the German curve, yields were up 2-5 bps on the day.    
    The risk of the German coalition collapsing before the next
election had risen, analysts said.
    ""Perhaps the biggest implications are for the euro zone as a
whole,"" said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at
Capital Economics. ""Given her (Merkel's) weakened position, an
agreement over Italy's budget may take longer to reach,
increasing the threat of contagion to other markets and adding
to the risks to Italian banks.""
    
    S&P LIFT
    For now, Italian bonds took their steer from news on Friday
that ratings agency Standard & Poor's had decided to leave
Italy's rating unchanged at BBB, two notches above junk.
    S&P lowered the ratings outlook to negative from stable,
saying that the new government's policy plans were weighing on
the country's growth and debt prospects. [nL8N1X67LT]
    But the decision to leave the rating unchanged, a week after
Moody's downgraded its Italy rating, bought some relief.
    Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to its lowest in almost a
month at 3.29 percent <IT10YT=RR>, falling further as German
bonds sold off. 
    The gap over top-rated German bond yields narrowed to 291
bps from around 306 bps late Friday <DE10IT10=RR>.
    ""The underlying budget concern is an ongoing issue but the
ratings risks are out of the way for the rest of the year as
there are no more scheduled ratings decisions,"" said Commerzbank
rates strategist Rainer Guntermann. 
    Lower Italian yields dragged Spanish and Portuguese yields
down <ES10YT=RR> <PT10YT=RR>, but the selloff in German bonds
and a firmer tone in European stock markets pushed up yields on
higher-rated euro zone bonds <FR10YT=RR> <NL10YT=RR>. [.EU]

    By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
    NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against
the euro, on Monday, close to a 10-week high hit last week, on
news German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election
as head of her CDU party.
    More broadly, the dollar added to recent gains against other
major currencies, supported by robust U.S. consumer spending
data on Monday.
    Merkel said she would not seek re-election as party
chairwoman, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has
dominated European politics. [nL8N1X924N][nL8N1X926U]
    ""Currency markets considered her the Iron Lady of Europe,""
said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global
Payments in Toronto.
    ""This is certainly not positive for the euro's political
backing,"" he said.
    Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in
the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with
Brexit and a budget crisis in Italy, said Schamotta.
    Merkel has loomed large on the European stage since 2005,
helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening
Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in
2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and Germany.    
    ""Merkel has been a stabilising force for the euro zone
throughout the last decade,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst
at online forex broker Oanda, said in a note.
    The euro was 0.28 percent lower against the greenback. 
    Schamotta cautioned against reading too much into the euro's
weakness on the day.
    ""I would not suggest that this might have a permanent impact
on the euro area. She is still chancellor and there is every
possibility that she moves on up to an European Council
position,"" he said.
    The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a
basket of six major currencies, was up 0.35 percent, just shy of
the 10-week high hit on Friday. The greenback rose 0.57 percent
against the Japanese yen, reclaiming some ground lost last week.
    The dollar has been boosted by growing volatility in capital
markets spurred by concerns about corporate earnings and
geopolitical uncertainty.
    Data showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh
straight month in September. [nL2N1X6143]
    The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again in
December.
    While speculators' trimmed their net long bets on the U.S.
dollar slightly in the latest week, they remain positioned
significantly long the greenback, data on Friday showed.
[nL2N1X61PV]
    The pound inched down to just above two-month lows as
traders prepared for the British finance minister's annual
budget speech. [nL8N1X91X9]

Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views
expressed are their own.

    LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Fresh from the surprise
announcement of her planned departure yesterday, Germany's
Angela Merkel grapples with what could become a key part of her
legacy today. She has invited African leaders to Berlin to forge
ahead with what has been described a ""Marshall Plan"" for Africa,
intended to boost private investment in the continent and so
pre-empt what her administration sees as the prospect of future
mass African migration into Europe. Rwanda's Paul Kagame, South
Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa and Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed will be among
the attendees. 
    While financial markets worry about Italy's expansive budget
plans, further west along the Mediterranean Portugal's minority
Socialist government is quietly getting its country's finances
in order. Today sees the first reading in parliament of the 2019
budget bill, which is designed to cut the deficit to 0.2 percent
- the lowest in the country's democratic history five years
after it emerged from a debt crisis and bailout. Moreover, it is
managing to do that while giving public-sector workers higher
pay, helping families with transport costs and investing more in
healthcare. The government's left-wing allies in parliament are
expected to support the bill, which will be subject to
amendments before a final vote in November.
    Some slightly underwhelming data on the French economy are
out this morning, with third-quarter growth up at 0.4 percent
but still less than the market consensus, plus consumer spending
falling more heavily than expected in September. That comes
ahead of the first reading for eurozone growth as a whole in the
third quarter this morning, with analysts expecting 0.4 percent
on the quarter for 1.8 percent over the year.
    
MARKETS AT 0655 GMT 
The speed with which the brief rally in U.S. stocks faded on
Monday gives ample evidence of the new mood on Wall Street, with
the latest twist focussing on the Sino-U.S. trade war and
reports Washington will impose tariffs on all Chinese imports by
the end of the year without progress at next month’s meeting of
Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The S&P 500 ended 0.6
percent lower, its weakest close in almost six months and just
shy of a 10 percent drop from last month’s record closing high.
Ahead of Apple’s third-quarter earnings on Thursday, tech stocks
led the retreat. The Vix volatility gauge probed above 25
percent, although it held below that level first thing on
Tuesday. By contrast, Chinese stocks gained overnight as
regulators promised a slew of market-supporting measures and the
onshore yuan’s guiding fix was set at its lowest level against
the dollar in 10 years. The Shanghai-Shenzhen composite gained
more 1 percent, recouping some of Monday’s heavy losses. Hong
Kong stocks were 0.7 percent in red, however. But a firmer
dollar and earnings reports helped equity benchmarks in Tokyo
and Seoul rise with Shanghai. MSCI’s all-country world index has
eked out as little as a 0.04 percent gain for the day so far,
with MSCI’s emerging-market benchmark in the red after hitting
its lowest level in more than 18 months earlier. 
    With core U.S. inflation readings coming in ahead of
forecast, the equity shakeout has yet to shift expectations of
further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve, and U.S.
Treasury yields and the dollar have pushed higher again more
broadly this week. Apart from another hail of earnings in
Europe, eyes are also on third-quarter GDP readings from across
the euro zone. France has already missed growth estimates, with
a sub-forecast 0.4 percent expansion during the quarter. It also
registered a much bigger-than-expected 1.7 drop in consumer
spending last month. Italy and overall euro zone GDP releases
are due out later. A worrying drop in business sentiment across
Europe in recent months has unnerved equity markets across the
continent as earnings growth comes in at less than half the pace
of U.S. peers, with trade worries exaggerated by political
nerves surrounding Italy’s budget standoff and brinkmanship in
Brexit negotiations. Results from BNP Paribas on Tuesday would
do nothing to quell investors’ concerns about European banks.
Shares in France’s largest-listed bank fell more than 3 percent
at the open after it said weakness at its corporate and
investment banking arm and at European retail banks drove
revenue down – a 5 percent miss against expectations. Reports on
Monday that China was planning to halve auto sales taxes gave
the auto sector some respite on Monday. But the darkening
economic clouds are already raising questions about the European
Central Bank’s plans to start normalizing its monetary policy
over the next 12 months. Flash October inflation readings are
also due out today and a number of prominent ECB speakers are on
the diary. 
    Sterling was weaker against the euro and dollar after
Monday’s UK autumn budget statement loosening fiscal policy
slightly – contingent on a Brexit deal - but the budget maths
left many doubts about over-optimistic economic growth forecasts
for next year. Italian government bonds yields dipped for a
second day in a row on Tuesday ahead of a key auction of
benchmark five and 10-year bonds.

October and employment hit a record high in September, data
showed on Tuesday, underlining the strength of a labour market
that is supporting a consumer-led upswing in Europe's largest
economy.
    The Federal Labour Office said the seasonally adjusted
jobless total fell by 11,000 to 2.292 million. That was slightly
below the predicted drop of 12,000.
    The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1 percent, the
lowest since German reunification in 1990.
    In a further positive sign, seasonally adjusted employment
as measured by the International Labour Organisation climbed by
557,000 on the year to a record of 45.0 million in September,
separate data released by the Federal Statistics Office showed.
    Household spending has a main growth driver in Germany as
record-high employment, increased job security, above-inflation
pay hikes and low borrowing costs all help open shoppers'
wallets.
    A survey last week showed that German shoppers look keen to
spend in November, but their expectations for the economy and
their own personal income have slipped on worries about
international trade conflicts and Brexit. [nB4N1W401S]

    ZAGREB, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Croatia plans to formally notify
Brussels next year about its intention of joining the two-year
waiting room before eventually adopting the euro currency,
central bank governor Boris Vujcic said on Tuesday.
    ""We're preparing a letter of intention on joining the
European Exchange Mechanism (ERM-2) (that) we plan to send (to
Brussels) next year,"" Vujcic told an economic panel.
    The ERM-2 is a tool that serves as a testing ground for the
countries that want to join the euro zone. During at least two
years a candidate country must prove the stability of its
currency against the euro within a determined fluctuation band.
    The Croatian government wants the country to join the ERM-2
in 2020 and to adopt the euro six to seven years from now.
    ""We're aware we must continue working on reducing
macroeconomic imbalances and pursuing structural reforms as a
precondition for joining the euro successfully,"" Vujcic said.
    Brussels already monitors Croatia for excessive public debt
which has been on a downward path in the last three years, from
around 85 percent of gross domestic product to around 75 percent
expected at the end of this year.
    One of the key conditions for joining the euro is that
public debt does not exceed 60 percent of GDP or, if somewhat
above it, clearly falling towards that level.
    The European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis,
who is on a visit to Zagreb, said that Brussels supported
Croatia's efforts, but also insisted on structural reforms that
would prove the economy resilient to potential shocks.
    ""At the moment Croatia's growth potential is not high enough
to converge quickly with more developed European Union
economies,"" he told the economic panel.
    Croatia's economy is currently growing slightly below three
percent annually, but its mid-term growth potential is seen at
between 1-2 percent amid a poor investment climate, a rather
slow and bloated public administration and low employment level
among its active population.

January to September, compared with a deficit of 62.6 million
euros in the same period last year, as inflows rose by 9.3
percent to 7.2 billion euros, the finance ministry said on
Tuesday.
    Spending was up by 2.9 percent, and spending on interest
rates for sovereign debt fell as Slovenia bought back some bonds
with high interest rates last year and issued new bonds at lower
rates.
    ""Tax income was 6.4 percent higher than in the same period
last year,"" the ministry said, and higher inflows of European
Union funds increased the surplus.
    Tax inflows increased amid robust economic growth, which the
government foresees at 4.4 percent this year compared with 4.9
percent in 2017, boosted by exports, investments and household
spending.
    Slovenia, which narrowly avoided an international bailout
for its banks in 2013, expects a general budget surplus of 0.5
percent of GDP this year versus a surplus of 0.1 percent in
2017, the statistics office said earlier in October. It plans a
surplus of 0.2 percent next year. [nL8N1WZ2FM]

    PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European Union should prepare
for its companies to be targeted by American sanctions in a
worsening trade dispute between the United States and China,
former World Trade Organisation (WTO) director general Pascal
Lamy said on Tuesday.
    As they weigh up a response to renewed U.S. sanctions
against Iran, which have forced an exodus of European companies,
EU governments should consider the prospect of similar
extraterritorial measures penalising China trade, Lamy told an
international investment conference in Paris.
    ""If the U.S. were to step further in not only hitting China
with trade measures but with sanctions, if they were to deal
with China the way they did with Iran, then we would all have a
big problem,"" he said.
    ""That's why we need to have a careful look at what will
happen in the case of Iran.""
    A surge in global protectionism from Brexit to the
U.S.-China trade war has done little to dent foreign direct
investment flows overall, according to data presented to the
XBMA conference on cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
    The global volume of M&A deals is projected to rise 26
percent this year to $4.34 trillion, its second-highest annual
total since 2007, the eve of the last major financial crisis.
    Chinese investors accounted for a record 20 percent of
European inbound deal volume last year as some turned their
attention away from the United States. Europe-China trade is
also expected to benefit from increased U.S.-China tariffs and
other barriers.
    The Trump administration in May withdrew Washington from an
international agreement to curb Tehran’s nuclear activities, and
imposed new sanctions against Iran. That triggered the mass
withdrawal of European companies from carmakers to oil majors,
in order to avoid crippling U.S. penalties reintroduced in
stages on Aug. 6 and Nov. 4.
    European governments have pledged in response to establish
new financing channels that shield companies from U.S.
sanctions, but a viable programme has yet to emerge.
    The comments by Lamy, who served as EU Trade Commissioner
before heading the WTO, expanded on recommendations published in
a policy paper http://institutdelors.eu/publications/leurope-face-aux-sanctions-americaines-quelle-souverainete/?lang=en
 last week by the Jacques Delors institute, a European
think-tank. 
    Europe could create its own extraterritorial mechanisms to
sanction breaches of environmental, data protection, tax and
anti-corruption laws, according to the paper co-authored by Lamy
and four others including Louis Schweitzer, honorary chairman of
carmaker Renault <RENA.PA>.
    Failing that, Brussels could use existing directives to halt
the EU activities of foreign banks ""from a third country that
imposes extraterritorial provisions on EU companies"", it said.
    ""It cannot be ruled out that the United States will impose
future sanctions on China that go beyond the current trade
measures initiated by the American president, which could then
be applied extraterritorially,"" the paper added.
    ""Perhaps it would be wise to take decisions for the Iranian
case by considering this wider economic and political context.""

    ROME, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European Commission has said
Italy's large public debt is a source of ""concern for the euro
area as a whole"" and has asked the government to address worries
about its big-spending 2019 budget by Nov. 13.
    ""Italy's public debt remains a key vulnerability,"" the
Commission wrote in a letter dated Oct. 29, which was released
by the Italian Treasury on Tuesday. The Treasury said it would
respond by the middle of next month, as requested.
    Italy is locked in a tussle with the EU executive, which
earlier this month rejected the government's expansionary budget
and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks.
    The ruling coalition has so far ruled this out.
    The budget targets a deficit next year of 2.4 percent of
gross domestic product, up from a targeted 1.8 percent this
year, flouting an EU requirement that the deficit should fall
steadily towards a balanced budget.
    The government has forecast that Italy's debt/GDP ratio will
fall next year to 130.0 percent from a projected 130.9 percent
this year, but the Commission said this was not enough.
    ""Such high public debt constrains the government's room for
manoeuvre (to allow) more productive investment for the benefit
of its citizens,"" it added.
